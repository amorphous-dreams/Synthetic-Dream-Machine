# Heleuma-Ka Interface (Soul / Fire)

**Ka**: soul, fire, drive, energy, thrust, movement. The animating charge. In motion toward state-change.

A heleuma-ka anchor exists outside the corpus **by current necessity, not by nature**. It has vitality. It is eligible to be promoted into a first-class corpus meme via the boot gate ceremony. The compiled-in code is a chrysalis.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #ooda-ha >>

✶ locate the compiled artifact and its extractable symbol; confirm it has a standalone function boundary.
⏿ orient: could this function be loaded from a corpus meme via `_bootModules()`? If yes, this is ka.
◇ declare `heleuma = "ka"`, `source-file`, `source-symbol`; confirm the symbol is a standalone declaration.
▶ write `#source` slot with the verbatim extracted function; close the quine record.
⤴ verify: `sync-heleuma` resolves the symbol, compares, reports clean; signal fields approach ceremony thresholds.
↺ the anchor lives. The soul moves. Ceremony awaits.

## Required Fields (SHALL)

An implementing meme SHALL declare in `#iam` TOML:

```toml
heleuma       = "ka"
source-file   = "<repo-relative path>"
source-symbol = "<standalone function or export name>"
```

An implementing meme SHALL carry a `#source` slot with the **complete verbatim** body of the named symbol (quine property). Partial captures violate the quine. If the natural unit is embedded in a larger function, extract it to a named function first.

An implementing meme MAY declare `body-sha256` when ready for promotion:

```toml
body-sha256 = "<sha256 hex of #source slot content>"
```

This is gate layer 2 (content integrity). Written by `sync-heleuma --commit` when the source is stable.

Gate layer 3 (operator authorization) will be a **keyhive capability proof** — an Ed25519-signed capability from a keyhive principal authorizing corpus injection. This replaces the pre-keyhive `promoted-at` timestamp sketch, which was never implemented and has been removed. Layer 3 is planned but not yet implemented; the gate currently passes on layers 1–2 only.

Signal fields (`mana`, `manao`, `manaoio`, `confidence`) SHALL approach 0.80 / 0.80 / 0.75 / 0.80 as the source matures. The boot gate reads these fields directly.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #promotion-path >>

## Promotion Path

When `body-sha256` is present and all signal thresholds are met, `_bootModules()` loads this meme as a live JS module, replacing the compiled-in fallback. (When keyhive lands, a capability proof will also be required — gate layer 3.) At that point:

- `heleuma = "ka"` SHALL be removed
- The meme pair becomes a standard corpus meme pair
- The doc meme `source` field MAY be retained as provenance
