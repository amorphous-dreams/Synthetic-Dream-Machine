# Hoʻoponopono — To Correct

A live claim accumulates pressure. Pressure wants to become canon.
Hoʻoponopono names the ceremony that restores harmony between the live session and the hostless meme space — through discussion, acknowledgment, and forgiveness of prior state.

Without the ceremony, promotion collapses into silent accumulation — a named failure mode.

<<~/ahu >>


<<~ ahu #ooda-ha >>
✶ gather the live claim, the target meme, affected invariants, and the operator's declared intent.
⏿ name what must be reconciled: conflicts, prior state, residue still outstanding.
◇ choose the least powerful write path that preserves trust ordering and leaves nothing unnamed.
▶ perform the crossing — create or revise the hostless meme only under explicit authority.
⤴ verify coherence: file-path, uri-path, interface claims, and known conflicts surface before promotion holds.
↺ release prior state with forgiveness; leave unpromoted residue as named session records with forward pressure.

<<~ ahu #ceremony >>

## The Ceremony

Hoʻoponopono requires:

1. **Discussion** — the operator names the claim aloud; conflicts and residue surface, not suppressed
2. **Acknowledgment** — prior state gets recognized; the meme under change gets read as it stands
3. **Forgiveness** — prior state releases without carrying forward as grievance
4. **Crossing** — the operator writes or revises the hostless meme under named authority
5. **Closure** — the node marks the live record as promoted; forward pressure discharges

The ceremony MAY compress steps when the change is small and uncontested.
The ceremony MUST NOT be skipped when a kapu carrier or invariant meme is the target.

<<~ ahu #promotion-path >>

## Promotion Path

```text
live exchange record
  → session crystal / mempalace
  → proposed docs meme (reviewed)
  → loci meme with explicit authority
  → invariant meme (admin-tier ceremony)
```

The path MAY skip intermediate surfaces only when an admin-tier operator explicitly authorizes the skip and the target law permits it.
The crossing MUST be named. Silent promotion is a failure mode — see `lar:///ha.ka.ba/api/v0.1/pono/failure-states/live-session-overwrite`.

A promotion record SHOULD include:

- source live exchange URI or session record
- target hostless `lar:///` URI
- changed text or new meme file
- authority confirmation
- known conflicts
- remaining residue

<<~ ahu #boundary-event >>

## Boundary Event

When a claim wants to outrank its current trust tier, the node SHOULD emit a boundary event rather than absorbing the claim silently.

Boundary event fields:

- claim
- current tier
- requested tier
- cited invariant or target meme
- recommended crossing path
- conflicts to reconcile before ceremony may proceed
