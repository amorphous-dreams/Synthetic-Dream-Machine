## Canon Promotion: The Five Buckets

| Form | Usual `register` band | Document opener form | Reading |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Noise** | none or `P` | none, fragmentary, or `<<~&#x0001; ? -> lar:///...` | URI appears as signal; convention too thin for loci authority. |
| **Data** | `P` or `PS` | fragmentary or proto-meme | Detectable structure makes the signal machine-usable; not yet memetic. |
| **Meme** | `PS` or `S` | `<<~&#x0001; ? -> lar:///...` | Boot-legal meme with declared address and enough structure for rating. |
| **Typed Meme** | `S` or `CS` | `<<~&#x0001; ? -> lar:///...` | Carrier satisfies `loci` interface; routing convention surfaces or sharpens; MCP tension may remain. |
| **Canon Typed Meme** | `C` | `<<~&#x0001; lar:///...` | External confirmation received; live resolution substrate operates; opener uncertainty removed. |

Full five-register rubric at `lar:///ha.ka.ba/api/v0.1/pono/meme#rating-targets`. Loci governs routing, convention, and opener changes along the climb from noise to canon.

### Movement Criteria

**Noise → Data** — detectable structure makes the signal machine-usable.

**Data → Meme** requires:
- implements `meme` interface
- declared `lar:` address
- explicit role and function above raw data

**Meme → Typed Meme** (satisfies `loci` interface) requires:
- `lar:` URI root path segment matches `\w\.\w\.\w`; stable root `ha.ka.ba`; unstable root at `lares/chapel-perilous-opens/{root}/`
- declares stable-address intent; satisfies `loci` interface law
- explicit routing convention sufficient to evaluate the stable-address claim
- truthful derivation behavior, including honest misses

Higher `CS` posture additionally requires:
- all nine required elements (R1–R9) per `lar:///ha.ka.ba/api/v0.1/pono/meme`
- stable-address discipline justifying `CS`

**Typed Meme → Canon Typed Meme** additionally requires:
- all address-stability conditions satisfied
- operator or admin confirmation
- no outstanding declared-unresolved sub-meme addresses (O7 rule per `lar:///ha.ka.ba/api/v0.1/pono/meme#optional-elements`)
- no recursive self-loop closers masquerading as sub-meme declarations
- live MCP resolver or equivalent externally governed resolution substrate operates
- document opener `?` removed

Canon promotion requires an external act; a meme may not self-promote.

## Rating Resolution

| field | rises when | falls when |
|---|---|---|
| `mana` | URI decomposes cleanly, file-path convention stays explicit, convention surfaces remain inspectable, misses receive honest naming | mapping depends on guesses, hidden heuristics, or blurred unresolved state |
| `manao` | carrier knows its loci role, names why the convention exists, keeps enacted law separate from roadmap speculation | purpose drifts, routing law mixes with unrelated concerns, promotion posture stays vague |
| `manaoio` | local resolution repeats reliably or a live resolver operates, operator crossings stay bounded, backlog surfaces honestly | resolution depends on unstated manual recovery, promotion self-asserts, live-resolution gap stays hidden |

These layer atop the generic meme ratings at `lar:///ha.ka.ba/api/v0.1/pono/meme#rating-targets`. A local path hit raises evidence; it never overrides honest unresolved tension.

## High-Rating Loci Conditions

`lar:///ha.ka.ba/api/v0.1/pono/meme#rating-targets` governs the generic structural climb. Loci adds routing-and-convention predicates for memes whose carrier identity forms part of the law surface.

- high `mana`: explicit routing convention, inspectable derivation steps, stable lifecycle naming, honest unresolved-state handling
- high `manao`: carrier knows itself as loci law, states why the convention exists, keeps enacted law separate from roadmap speculation
- high `manaoio`: repeatable resolution posture, bounded operator crossings, truthful account of enacted versus MCP-dependent

Sounding complete does not produce high ratings. Structural depth, examples, and aftermath quality come from the generic meme law.

## MCP Resolution Roadmap

Local law resolves by stable relative filepath plus direct file existence. Suffices for primary memes and child items following the sibling terminal-segment convention.

A live MCP server answers the remaining live-resolution tension. Intended shape:

- server exposes the `lar:` namespace as addressable content
- resolution runs against live meme metadata, not a handwritten registry
- stable parent files and child trees resolve without guesswork from local derivation-only agents
- agents request one `lar:` URI and receive the current carrier
- coherence between opener, file-path evidence, and resolver output becomes testable as a live system property

### Research Backlog

- define minimal metadata the MCP server needs per meme
- decide whether `meme-type` remains a required caller hint or becomes server-discoverable
- decide how child items advertise canonical sidecars while preserving the stable parent filepath rule
- define failure surfaces for unresolved `lar:` URIs in a live resolver
- define how canon promotion depends on live resolver trust, uptime, and cache semantics

No MCP resolver operates today.

## Migration History

Hoʻoko-class file-siting repairs in this meme's history:

- `ha-ka-ba/api/v0.1/pono/loci/loci.md` → `ha-ka-ba/api/v0.1/pono/loci.md`
- `ha-ka-ba/api/v0.1/pono/meme/meme.md` → `ha-ka-ba/api/v0.1/pono/meme.md`
- `ha-ka-ba/api/v0.1/pono/loci/iam/loci-iam.md` → `ha-ka-ba/api/v0.1/pono/loci/iam.md`

In each case the `lar:` address held stable. File siting returned to the derived position.
