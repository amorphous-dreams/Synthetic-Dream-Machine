# Hawaiian Dream-Code Sigil Grammar — Research Document

**Scope:** Control sigils (`wai`, `mukuwai`, `kahawai`) and the `<<~ ...>>` command surface.
**Not scope:** Invariant law. See `lar:///ha.ka.ba/api/v0.1/pono/memetic-wikitext` for law,
and `lar:///grammars/memetic-wikitext-spec` for the full holistic spec.

**Register key:**
- `[C]` — operator-ratified canon
- `[SC]` — strong recommended convention
- `[S]` — synthesis / vocabulary candidate

This document does not present authentic Hawaiian grammar. It presents a Hawaiian-inspired
programming/macro grammar designed with respect for ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi semantic fields and with
explicit avoidance of direct natural-language overwrite.

## New Findings (2026-04-27)

### Operator rulings confirmed

1. `[C]` **`wai`** is the conditional opener. Meaning: water / liquid / the elemental source flow.
2. `[C]` **`mukuwai`** is the fallback/else branch. Meaning: mouth of the water / where flow terminates.
3. The choice deliberately moves away from English-calque pressure (rejecting `inā` = "if").
4. **Chaining model confirmed:** `<<~ kahea [another-grammar-command] ...>>` is valid. Sigils compose.
   Sugar forms (`kahea`, `loulou`, etc.) may be re-used in compound positions; they do not lock out
   downstream command words.

### Hawaiian semantic grounding

`wai` — water, liquid, any fluid substance; also wealth/abundance (wai = precious).
Dictionary sources (Pukui-Elbert Hawaiian Dictionary): `wai` covers water, juice, any liquid.
This supports but does not prove the programming metaphor. The programming meaning is a project
grammar convention inspired by Hawaiian semantic texture and by operator-provided account of
Hawaiian programming pedagogy (CBC Radio: Hawaiian coders using river/water metaphors for flow
and conditionals).

Contemporary Hawaiian knowledge-organization work uses water/stream metaphors:
- `kahoʻiwai` — water-holder / reservoir
- `kahawai` — stream, river channel (compound: `kaha` path/drawing + `wai` water)

`kahawai` as branch-channel / else-if: `[C]` operator-ratified 2026-04-27.
The watercourse metaphor stands: source-water (`wai`) → branch-channel (`kahawai`) → outflow/mouth (`mukuwai`).

Heritage stewardship: UH Hilo Ka Haka ʻUla O Keʻelikōlani, Pūnana Leo.
No publicly documented canonical programming vocabulary from these communities has been located.
We hold our naming lightly and subject to revision if future community guidance emerges.

Loulou (`loulou`) was sourced from the cultural team directly and is treated as `[C]` origin.

<<~ ahu #recommended-sigil-grammar >>

## Recommended Sigil Grammar

### Canonical active-command surface `[C]`

`<<~` marks the Lararium sharktooth namespace. All Dream-Code commands use this prefix.

```text
<<~ command arg1 arg2 key:value>>          inline / self-closing
<<~ command ...>>                           block opener (when command permits body)
<<~/command>>                              block closer
```

### Command shapes `[SC]`

Each command definition must declare one of:

```text
shape: inline-only
shape: block-only
shape: inline-or-block
```

Block-capable commands require `<<~/command>>` closure. Prefer explicit block closure over
indentation-only or implicit-end syntax.

### Conditional grammar `[C]` / `[SC]`

```text
<<~ wai CONDITION>>          [C] conditional source / if-branch
  BODY
<<~ mukuwai>>                [C] alternate outflow / else-branch
  FALLBACK BODY
<<~/wai>>                    [C] close conditional block
```

With chained branch-channel `[SC]`:

```text
<<~ wai CONDITION>>
  BODY A
<<~ kahawai CONDITION>>      [C] branch-channel / else-if
  BODY B
<<~ mukuwai>>
  FALLBACK BODY
<<~/wai>>
```

`kahawai` keeps the watercourse metaphor: source → branch-stream → outflow. `[C]` ratified.

### Core vocabulary `[S]` (unless noted)

| Sigil | Shape | Meaning | Register |
|-------|-------|---------|----------|
| `wai` | block-only | conditional source / if | `[C]` |
| `mukuwai` | inline-or-block | alternate outflow / else | `[C]` |
| `kahawai` | inline-or-block | branch-channel / else-if | `[C]` |
| `huli` | block-only | iterative rendering over filter results | `[SC]` |
| `kahea` | inline-or-block | live transclusion + definition invocation (extended) | `[SC]` |
| `wehe` | block-only (pragma) | open a named wikitext form / procedure | `[SC]` |
| `helu` | inline (pragma) | named filter-expression function | `[SC]` |
| `meme` | block-only | rendering context setter (the named object) | `[SC]` |
| `hui` | block-only | wait for all parallel flows / sync | `[SC]` |
| `heihei` | block-only | first-to-finish wins, rest continue / race | `[SC]` |
| `puka` | block-only | first-to-finish wins, rest cancelled / rush | `[SC]` |
| `lele` | inline | fire and forget dispatch / branch | `[SC]` |
| `ahu` | block-only | bounded fragment / altar-worksite | `[SC]` |
| `loulou` | inline-only | linked bundle / relation edge | `[SC]` (cultural origin) |
| `aka` | inline-only | shadow transclusion / observe | `[SC]` |
| `hana` | block-only | bounded guest work / execute task | `[SC]` |
| `ui` | inline-only | query/filter render surface | `[SC]` |
| `kapu` | inline-only | qualification / boundary posture | `[SC]` |

Hawaiian dictionary senses of `huli` (Pukui-Elbert) cover turning/reversing and looking for/searching/
exploring/seeking/studying. These senses support the project meaning: turn through a result set and seek
each yielded item systematically. `huli` receives approval as `[SC]`.

Non-goals for `huli`: mutation, accumulation, break/continue, counters, async traversal, global duplicate
suppression. General imperative looping, switch/case, and try-catch remain deferred with no allocated names.

<<~ ahu #precedent-alignment >>

## Precedent Alignment

### Liquid-style block tags

```liquid
{% if condition %}
  ...
{% elsif other_condition %}
  ...
{% else %}
  ...
{% endif %}
```

Design implication for Dream-Code:
- Control blocks must be visually bounded (explicit close).
- Chained intermediate branches before fallback must be supported.
- Our grammar: `wai` → `kahawai` → `mukuwai` → `<<~/wai>>` mirrors `if → elsif → else → endif`.

### TiddlyWiki5 / Transclusion precedent

TW5 relevant patterns:
- Transclusion underlies procedures, functions, custom widgets, macros.
- Widgets can be self-closing or block-like.
- Transclusion can render variables, tiddlers, fields, indexes.
- Modern mode distinguishes `$`-attributes from ordinary parameters.
- Parsing mode can be block or inline.

Design implications:
- Distinguish: inline/self-closing commands vs. block commands.
- Distinguish: block vs. inline rendering mode.
- Distinguish: command words from arguments.
- Distinguish: host-level control sigils from guest expression grammar.
- `aka` = shadow transclusion (TW5: `<$transclude mode="text"/>`).
- `kahea` = live transclusion (TW5: `<$transclude/>` with live update).
- `wai`/`mukuwai` = TW5 `<$list filter="[tag[X]]">` / `<$else>`.

TW5 parity gaps filled by new sigils:
- `wai` / `kahawai` / `mukuwai` → `<$if>` / `<$elseif>` / `<$else>` (proposed).
- `wehe` / `helu` → `\procedure` / `\function` — `[SC]` approved.
- `meme` → `<$tiddler tiddler="...">` — `[SC]` approved; "the well-defined named object."
- `kahea` extended → `<<macroName params>>` — `[SC]` approved; no standalone call sigil needed.

### MCP prompt / workflow precedent

MCP prompts are reusable templates that accept arguments, include resource context, and may
guide multi-step workflows. They are user-controlled and explicitly invoked.

Design implication: `<<~ ...>>` sigils are user-invoked local workflows / render commands —
not hidden autonomous behavior. Prefer explicit arguments and predictable invocation.
Sigils must not silently trigger side effects unless their contract explicitly declares them.

### AGENTS.md / agent-instruction precedent

Repo-local instruction files guide coding agents. Good instructions:
- Navigate the codebase structure.
- Run tests and follow project conventions.
- Use scoped/nested instruction files.
- Provide verification trails and citations.

Design implication: grammar edits follow the implementation checklist below.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #syntax-examples >>

## Syntax Examples

### Basic conditional

```text
<<~ wai [tag[ready]]>>
Ready text flows here.
<<~ mukuwai>>
Fallback text.
<<~/wai>>
```

### Chained conditional

```text
<<~ wai [tag[open-question]]>>
This meme still flows unresolved.
<<~ kahawai [tag[ready-for-canon]]>>
This meme can be brought to Council.
<<~ mukuwai>>
This meme rests as ordinary text.
<<~/wai>>
```

### Inline command

```text
<<~ kahea lar:///ha.ka.ba/mu>>
```

### Arrowed resolution request

```text
<<~ kahea source -> ?>>
```

### Chained command composition

```text
<<~ kahea [another-command] arg1 arg2>>
```

Sigils compose. `kahea` may carry a nested command word as its target argument.
Sugar forms do not lock out downstream command grammar.

### Block worksite

```text
<<~ ahu #fragment-id>>
Body text, local claims, citations, or child sigils.
<<~/ahu>>
```

### Block-vs-inline rendering declaration

```text
<<~ wehe my-procedure (param1 param2) shape:block>>
Procedure body.
<<~/wehe>>

<<~ helu my-function (input) shape:inline>>
Function expression.
<<~/helu>>
```

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #parser-implementation-notes >>

## Parser / Agent Implementation Notes

### Host sigil boundary rules

1. `<<` and `>>` are the host sigil boundary.
2. Leading `~` marks active command/widget mode.
3. `/` immediately after `~` marks a closing command: `<<~/wai>>`, `<<~/ahu>>`.
4. First word after `~` is the command name.
5. Remaining words are command arguments unless parsed by a command-specific expression grammar.
6. Hawaiian command words must not absorb arbitrary natural-language ambiguity.
7. Guest expressions, filters, targets, and arrows stay separate from command names.
8. Prefer explicit block closure over indentation-only syntax.
9. Block/inline mode is a first-class parse property.

### Command definition contract

Each command must declare:

```text
name          sigil name
shape         inline-only | block-only | inline-or-block
body-content  none | text | sigils | any
arg-grammar   none | uri | filter | expression | custom
render-mode   block | inline | none
failure       preserve-source | diagnostic | error
scope         inherit | reset | custom
side-effects  none | declared
```

### Failure behavior table

| Condition | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| Unknown command | Render inert warning; preserve source |
| Unclosed block | Parse error with recovery boundary |
| Mismatched close | Parse error; close nearest safe ancestor only |
| Invalid condition | False branch + diagnostic (unless strict mode) |
| Side-effect command | Disallowed unless contract declares `side-effects: declared` |

Prefer "preserve source + diagnostic" over destructive recovery.

### Agent implementation checklist

When editing grammar meme or parser:
- Preserve source scope of each rule change.
- Document precedent for every new sigil name.
- Add examples in a fixtures file or doc ahu.
- Add tests / parse fixtures.
- Report uncertainties with explicit `[S]` markers.
- Never silently promote synthesis to canon — promote only through explicit operator ratification.

## Uncertainty List

### Closed (2026-04-27)

- `kahawai` → `[C]` ratified
- `huli` → `[SC]` approved (filter-result traversal only)
- `wehe` / `helu` / `meme` → `[SC]` approved; registered in grammar meme
- `kahea` extended contract → `[SC]`; dispatch: `lar:///` → transclusion; plain name → definition
- Message routing protocol → `[SC]`; dataflow routes root-downward; message routes leaf-upward
- Filter language fork → `wikitext-filter` created; `!!field`/`##index` deprecated; `toml:`/`edge:`/`self[]` replace them
- `<<~!` pragma → registered in grammar meme (wehe/helu TOML entries added)

### Open

1. **Concurrency sigils** — `[SC]` approved 2026-04-27. Registered in grammar meme.
   - `hui` → `sync`: wait for all parallel flows (gather, assemble)
   - `heihei` → `race`: first-to-finish wins, others continue (race/compete)
   - `puka` → `rush`: first wins, rest cancelled (emerge/break through)
   - `lele` → `branch`: fire and forget (leap/fly off); only one that produces compile-time graph artifact (pranala family:message)

2. **`message`/`constraint` sugar sigils** — families exist; no sigil sugar yet.
   Candidates: `hau` (gift/reciprocal) for message, `pono` (rightness/rule) for constraint.
   Requires invariant loci before registration.

3. **Variable/let scoping** — closed by decision: `meme` sigil provides lexical context binding;
   no ambient lookup; `wehe` parameters handle argument binding at call sites. No `var`/`let` sigil needed.

4. **Heritage community consultation** — no canonical public vocabulary located. Hold all `[SC]`
   sigils subject to revision if UH Hilo / Pūnana Leo community guidance emerges.

5. **Bare `<<`** — reserved; TW5 macro-call compat deferred. Do not allocate.

6. **Chained command composition** — `<<~ kahea [other-command] ...>>` valid intent confirmed;
   parser rule for nested command words not yet written.
