# X-TiddlyWiki-Filter — Docs

This file does not bind invariant law.
Law lives at [tiddlywiki-filter.md](../../api/v0.1/grammars/tiddlywiki-filter.md).
Procedure lives at [tiddlywiki-filter/SKILL.md](../../api/v0.1/grammars/tiddlywiki-filter/SKILL.md).

This file holds examples, explanatory guidance, reminders, and notes on deferred scope.

## Canonical Examples

### Example A — contextual relation query

Find all sigils that link to the current meme:

```text
<<~ hana #work >>
```toml
grammar = "x-tiddlywiki-filter"
context = "+currentMeme"
degrade = "no-op"
result-shape = "set"
```

[all[sigils]links:to[+currentMeme]]
<<~/hana >>
```

### Example B — tag-based filtering

Find all sigils tagged `task` excluding the current meme:

```text
<<~ hana #work >>
```toml
grammar = "x-tiddlywiki-filter"
context = "+currentMeme"
degrade = "no-op"
result-shape = "set"
```

[tag[task]!title[+currentMeme]]
<<~/hana >>
```

### Example C — metadata extraction

Get the `status` field of the current meme:

```text
<<~ hana #work >>
```toml
grammar = "x-tiddlywiki-filter"
context = "+currentMeme"
degrade = "empty-set"
result-shape = "scalar"
```

[+currentMeme] [get[status]]
<<~/hana >>
```

### Example D — hierarchy discovery

Get the parent-list of the current meme:

```text
<<~ hana #work >>
```toml
grammar = "x-tiddlywiki-filter"
context = "+currentMeme"
degrade = "empty-set"
result-shape = "list"
```

[list[+currentMeme!!parent-list]]
<<~/hana >>
```

### Example E — orphaned-sigil batch filtering

Find all untagged non-system sigils:

```text
<<~ hana #work >>
```toml
grammar = "x-tiddlywiki-filter"
context = "+currentMeme"
degrade = "no-op"
result-shape = "set"
```

[all[sigils]untagged[]!is[system]]
<<~/hana >>
```

## Guidance

### Why the translation stays deterministic

The host ontology centers on Sigils and Memes rather than tiddlers.
Leaving TW metaphysical vocabulary in host-facing prose creates ambiguity about which model governs a given claim.
Deterministic substitution keeps the boundary sharp without requiring authors to relearn the filter syntax itself — only the nouns change.

### Why `operator` stays reserved

`operator` already carries authn/authz meaning in this host.
Borrowing it for the imported grammar code surface would force readers to context-shift every time they see the word.
**Function sigil** names the concept accurately without collision.

### Why ha/ka/ba sub-blocks were not carried into the parent

The original `constitutional-charge-ha`, `sigil-centric-translation-ka`, and similar sub-blocks described what their parent sections "hold" or "govern" rather than holding or governing anything themselves.
Eighteen sub-blocks, zero additional binding content.
They added bulk without adding law and were cut rather than moved.

### Deferred scope

The following remain outside this invariant and stay parser/render territory:

- full legality table for every TiddlyWiki filter function sigil
- AST node schema beyond the minimum lowering expectations
- widget and render schema for specific result shapes
- target-specific lowering rules for each render backend
- fixture execution detail
- conformance test suite

A future parser meme and render-pipeline meme should absorb these when they are ready to be written.
