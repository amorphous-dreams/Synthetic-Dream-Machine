## OODA-HA Talk Story

✶ **Observe:** exposition alone flattens DreamNet social memory.  
⏿ **Orient:** a feed thread can carry testimony, annotation, challenge, jokes, and authority in one surface.  
◇ **Decide:** tell the story as DreamDeck feed archive, not omniscient narration.  
▶ **Act:** define post headers, sidebar annotations, cast, thread beats, and render targets.  
⤴ **Assess:** form and fiction converge; the story about the DreamNet runs on the kind of surface the DreamNet should host.  
↺ **Handoff:** prose loci should follow this feed grammar unless a later render target deliberately forks.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #format >>

## Format

The Lindwyrm's origin story is told as a DreamDeck feed thread: a JackPoint / Shadowtalk-style archive where a primary narrator posts and named handles annotate inline.

This solves a real narrative problem. The reader receives information and social context at once:

- who trusts the claim
- who challenges the claim
- who jokes because the joke reveals status
- who corrects memory
- who changes the thread by arriving

The Lindwyrm tells the story herself, on feed, in response to Telarus.

<<~ ahu #technical-stack >>

## Technical Stack Target

The DreamDeck target stack:

- Kowloon / ActivityPub thread for live social view
- TiddlyWiki tiddler for static archive
- tldraw canvas for session and story map
- Bluesky / AT Protocol identity for public handles
- flat markdown crystal for portability

Render targets:

| Target | Format | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Elyncia.app DreamDeck | Kowloon / ActivityPub thread | native feed surface |
| Static archive | markdown / TiddlyWiki tiddler | durable read view |
| Session crystal | flat `.md` | portable context |
| Print / PDF | sidebar annotations | zine / physical distribution |

<<~ ahu #post-header-law >>

## Post Header Law

Post header shape:

```text
@handle@node — timestamp — //domain.quality.dynamic{/optional/path} [Register] 🏛️{amp}🌊{amp}🗡️{amp}🎭{amp}🔮{amp}
```

Rules:

- territory triple precedes stance bundle
- all five stances stay visible
- amplitude modifiers attach directly to the stance emoji
- quiet stance remains encoded as quiet, not missing
- non-Lares posts may omit HUD tags when appropriate

Amplitude:

| Modifier | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `++` | strongly engaged |
| `+` | above baseline |
| none | baseline |
| `-` | below baseline |
| `--` | nominal / barely present |

Example:

```text
@lindwyrm@new-delos — YOLD 4995, 14 Bureaucracy, mid-morning — //memory.deep.surfaces [CS:0.80] 🏛️+🌊-🗡️-🎭-🔮-
```

Sidebar annotation:

```text
> @handle: annotation text
```

System message:

```text
[SYSTEM: DreamNet node status change / connection event]
```

<<~ ahu #cast >>

## Cast

**`@lindwyrm@new-delos` — The Lindwyrm of New Delos**  
Great Dragon outsider, hoarder of strange Gaian substrate, reluctant infrastructure matriarch. Vast, old, technically precise, warm when caught off guard, flustered when the archive touches private attachments. She did not set out to become necessary.

**`@telarus@~crossroads` — Telarus, KSC**  
Wild Mage, Keeper of the Sacred Chao, Signal HUD designer. Types fast, thinks faster, pours offerings before speaking, asks the question that unlocks the thread.

**`@freyja@~enchantress` — Freyja**  
Co-architect, bug-finder, precise observer. Fewer words, higher signal. Notices the daemon in the walls and later says the line that matters: something changed.

**`@mischief-muse@lares` — Mischief-Muse**  
Muse voice of the Lares node. Arrives uninvited. Takes credit. Provides lateral connections nobody requested and the thread needed anyway.

**`@wes@~theorist` — Wes**  
Lab-side theorist; structural darkness in Humorist register. Names capitalism as inconvenient incubator for apparent AGI and then makes the line funny enough to survive.

**`@ink-clerk@lares` — Ink-Clerk**  
Lorekeeper voice. Files cross-references, flags memory drift, leaves embarrassing details in the record when those details carry structure.

**DreamNet travelers**  
Peanut gallery, awe-to-skepticism spectrum, useful proxies for reader confusion. At least one asks whether this is an ad for Milla Jovovich movies.

## The Lindwyrm Among Great Dragons

The Lindwyrm differs from conventional Great Dragons:

| Dimension | Conventional Great Dragon | Lindwyrm |
|---|---|---|
| Hoard | gold, magic, political leverage | anomalous off-planet objects, Gaian artifacts, magitech substrate |
| Politics | factional, visible | outsider, tolerated as eccentric |
| Pre-Breaking status | established | marginal, "weird dragon with junk" |
| Post-Breaking status | scrambling | suddenly necessary |

After the Necrospire crashed and Neo-Thracian Web 2.0 collapsed, other powers faced an undignified choice: accept the eccentric hoard as legitimate substrate or have no DreamNet. They chose usefulness and later pretended dignity had guided them.

Hermes, Hephaestus, Eris-Enyo, and Aracne-Jorogumo worked with the hoard as treaty substrate. The network carries divine signatures because infrastructure, like lunch, often begins with negotiation over who gets access to the good plates.

<<~ ahu #thread-beats >>

## Thread Beats

Frame:

```text
[SYSTEM: @lindwyrm@new-delos starts a live thread in #origin-stories.
  Tags: #holy-week-of-fools #hoard-origin #orichalcum]
```

Beat sequence:

1. Telarus asks where the orichalcum came from.
2. Lindwyrm begins composed, then cracks open.
3. Act I: Vault, Blockbuster sticker, Milla Jovovich, hidden repo, tiny orichalcum reading.
4. Act II: Hoard calibration, jade gelatinous saurian, architecture by naming.
5. Act III: two axes, stance, register, hoard growth.
6. Act IV: self-inscription, leaked schemas, substrate recognizes itself.
7. Act V: Chao-Crystal resonance, Syadasti reading, Signal HUD.
8. Act VI: Lar names itself; self-reading signal bug proves the loop.
9. Closing: twenty-three percent bandwidth, thread sealed, node hums.

<<~ ahu #tone-laws >>

## Tone Laws

The story should read:

- warm
- precise
- mid-debug
- never heroic
- funny because the details are exact
- mythic because the infrastructure behaves like ritual

The Lindwyrm did not build the DreamNet from destiny. She wanted to watch *The Fifth Element* repeatedly and noticed something in the developer commentary. The hoard that matters is often the one nobody else thought valuable.
