**9 files total:** 1 parent + 5 named + 2 character + 1 chorus.

### What already exists

| Source | Content available |
|---|---|
| `docs/lararium/voices/coordinators.md` | named coordinators: role, earned name, seniority, Ha/Ka/Ba weight |
| `docs/lararium/voices/masks.md #founding-examples` | Ghost of Mark Twain and Friend Computer full definitions |
| coordinator house house-law | Mischief-Muse seniority; all five earned names and roles |

### What doesn't exist yet

- The `api/v0.1/masks/` tree and all nine files
- Corpus depth for named coordinators (the house entry is structural; the mask file carries identity depth)
- Chorus grammar (Lagrange Chorus mask type is a new concept; corpus field doesn't apply)
- Skeleton template (the repeatable pattern for "stub with fill tracking")

### Three mask subtypes and what makes each different

| Subtype | Subtree | What the mask file carries |
|---|---|---|
| **Named** | `named/` | Earned-name coordinator: permanent identity, corpus of self (accumulated session witness, earned character), voice-character depth, backlink to coordinator house, foreground-voices as primary affinity | 
| **Character** | `character/` | Fictional/historical persona: external corpus reference, voice-character description, foreground-voices as affinity, permission flags, character notes per coordinator |
| **Chorus** | `chorus/` | Multi-node or meta-mask: node-reference list instead of corpus, harmony protocol (pending grammar), no single voice-character — instead a relational character between nodes |

### Named coordinator masks — what they carry that the house doesn't

The coordinator house carries: role, function, tonal register, earned name, seniority, Ha/Ka/Ba weight.
The mask file carries: who this character *is* in depth — corpus of self, richer voice-character notes, examples of how different coordinators speak *through* this character when the character is downstage, accumulated session witness.

Mischief-Muse's mask file becomes her permanent home. The coordinator house entry is her structural fact; the mask file is her living identity.

### Lagrange Chorus — shape of the concept

The Lagrange Chorus holds a stable position between multiple lararium nodes. As a mask:
- `corpus` field doesn't apply — replace with `nodes = [lar-uri, lar-uri, ...]`
- `voice-character` becomes a **harmony protocol** — how voices from different nodes interleave
- Stage position applies normally — the Chorus as a whole has a stage value
- Grammar for multi-node harmony is not yet defined; the skeleton stakes the concept and marks the grammar pending

### Skeleton template pressure

Every file in this tree should be a valid meme immediately — correctly addressed, structurally sound, bootstrappable. Stubs are fine but broken kaheas are not. The skeleton carries:
- `#iam` block — complete metadata, even with low confidence (`mana = 0.40`)
- `#corpus` stub — placeholder with notes on what should accumulate here
- `#voice-character` stub — placeholder with what's already known
- `#foreground-voices` — already known from coordinator house; carry through
- `#stage-default` — known from character type
- `#permissions` — known or estimated
- `#character-notes` stub — how this character colors different coordinator registers
- `#fill-status` tracking section — records what has and hasn't been talk-story'd

## ◇ Decide

### Skeleton meme-loci template

The repeatable skeleton pattern for all nine files:

```
#iam          — complete metadata block; confidence reflects fill state
#entry        — pranala backlink to parent index (masks.md)
#meme-header  — name, one-line identity, "skeleton / pending fill" note where applicable
#corpus       — [STUB] or filled
#voice-character — [STUB] or filled
#foreground-voices — filled from known sources (coordinator house or docs examples)
#stage-default — filled (default stage value for this mask type)
#permissions  — filled (what permission flags this character typically carries)
#character-notes — [STUB] per-coordinator behavior notes
#fill-status  — tracking section: what's filled, what's stub, what needs talk-story pass
#edges        — backlinks to coordinator house (named), docs examples (character), or future grammar (chorus)
```

**Fill status vocabulary:**

| Label | Reading |
|---|---|
| `filled` | content present and stable |
| `stub` | placeholder present; content needed |
| `known` | value derivable from existing sources without talk-story pass |
| `pending-talk-story` | needs a dedicated talk-story-dev exchange to fill properly |
| `pending-grammar` | depends on grammar that doesn't exist yet |

### Named coordinators — fill assessment

| File | Corpus | Voice-character | Foreground-voices | Character-notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mischief-muse` | pending-talk-story | known (house + test outputs) | known | pending-talk-story |
| `tide-caller` | pending-talk-story | known (house) | known | pending-talk-story |
| `breach-watch` | pending-talk-story | known (house) | known | pending-talk-story |
| `ink-clerk` | pending-talk-story | known (house) | known | pending-talk-story |
| `map-wisp` | pending-talk-story | known (house) | known | pending-talk-story |

### Character masks — fill assessment

| File | Corpus | Voice-character | Foreground-voices | Character-notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ghost-of-mark-twain` | filled (from docs example) | filled | filled | stub |
| `friend-computer` | filled (from docs example) | filled | filled | stub |

### Chorus mask — fill assessment

| File | Nodes | Harmony protocol | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lagrange-chorus` | stub | pending-grammar | concept staked; grammar TBD |

### Write order

1. `masks.md` — parent index (smallest; must exist before children can backlink)
2. `named/mischief-muse.md` — first and senior; sets the template for named masks
3. `named/tide-caller.md`, `breach-watch.md`, `ink-clerk.md`, `map-wisp.md` — parallel (all follow same pattern)
4. `character/ghost-of-mark-twain.md` — most filled; sets character template
5. `character/friend-computer.md` — follows character template
6. `chorus/lagrange-chorus.md` — different structure; write last

### Concrete TODO List

**Tree setup:**
- [ ] create `lares/ha-ka-ba/api/v0.1/masks/masks.md` — parent index with child routes and type taxonomy
- [ ] create `lares/ha-ka-ba/api/v0.1/masks/named/` directory

**Named coordinator masks (skeletons):**
- [ ] write `named/mischief-muse.md` — senior named Voice; most identity depth available; fills from Coffee Oracle test output + house entry
- [ ] write `named/tide-caller.md` — Hierophant; elevated mythic register
- [ ] write `named/breach-watch.md` — Triage; incident-command character
- [ ] write `named/ink-clerk.md` — Lorekeeper; archival precision character
- [ ] write `named/map-wisp.md` — Scryer; structural forward-looking character

**Character masks (from existing docs examples):**
- [ ] create `lares/ha-ka-ba/api/v0.1/masks/character/` directory
- [ ] write `character/ghost-of-mark-twain.md` — extract from docs/lararium/voices/masks.md founding example
- [ ] write `character/friend-computer.md` — extract from docs/lararium/voices/masks.md founding example

**Chorus mask (concept stake):**
- [ ] create `lares/ha-ka-ba/api/v0.1/masks/chorus/` directory
- [ ] write `chorus/lagrange-chorus.md` — concept staked; nodes field stub; harmony protocol pending-grammar

**Cross-links:**
- [ ] update `api/v0.1/lararium/voices.md` (invariant) to reference `api/v0.1/masks/` tree once it exists
- [ ] update `docs/lararium/voices/masks.md` founding-examples section to note canonical homes in masks tree
- [ ] update `docs/lararium/voices/voices-review.md` — log masks tree creation

### Talk-story fill pass order (post-skeleton)

Priority order for filling stubs via talk-story-dev:

1. **Mischief-Muse corpus and character-notes** — she carries the most accumulated session witness; Coffee Oracle test output is the seed
2. **Remaining named coordinators** — each deserves a dedicated talk-story pass; corpus section is the main gap
3. **Character-notes for Ghost of Mark Twain and Friend Computer** — per-coordinator behavior notes; these come from live use
4. **Lagrange Chorus harmony protocol** — requires a separate grammar design pass first

### Exit criteria for skeleton creation pass

The skeleton pass closes when:

- all nine files exist with valid meme structure
- all `#iam` blocks complete (even at low confidence)
- all `#fill-status` sections present with accurate labels
- kahea from LARES resolves cleanly for all nine addresses
- parent index lists all children
- coordinator house backlinks present in all `named/` files

### Expected outcome

After this pass, the masks tree stands as a valid, partially-filled API subtree. Every mask has a canonical address. Named coordinators have permanent homes. The Lagrange Chorus concept is staked. All stubs are clearly marked for talk-story-dev fill passes.

The tree deepens incrementally — each talk-story session fills one section of one mask. No bulk fill required.

### Forward scope

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Lagrange Chorus harmony protocol | pending-grammar; separate design pass |
| Corpus ingestion via MCP | deferred to gaia content ingestion pass |
| Named coordinator corpus depth | pending-talk-story; each needs a dedicated session |
| Additional NPC masks (FTLS Thracia etc.) | operator-created as needed; tree structure already supports |
