## Core Proposition

The pranala-edge DAG replaces static enumeration as the source of truth for boot closure.

**Terminology Note:**
*A "meme" is any carrier of a lar URI and is the default node in the graph. A "locus" is a meme that implements the loci interface (see canonical interface at its own URI). Use "meme/memes" for general graph structure, reserving "locus/loci" for interface boundaries and in "implements" blocks as required by canonical law. This distinction is intentional and should be preserved in all design docs and specs.*

Three structural claims drive the redesign:

1. **Build-system pattern.** Bazel and Buck2 separate the dependency graph (targets), the action graph (operations), and the evaluation graph (state). Lararium needs the same separation: a carrier graph (loci + typed edges), a compilation graph (operations over carriers), and an artifact graph (content-addressed outputs). Conflating them into one flat list produces the current stub.

2. **Temporal KG pattern.** Graphiti's bi-temporal four-timestamp model and TerminusDB's append-only delta encoding show that declared-unresolved forward references belong in the graph as valid entries, not as errors. A boot walk discovers them and classifies them by severity rather than failing.

3. **ECS plane pattern.** UEFN's Scene Graph separates `entity` (pure container, no data), `component` (attached capability, owns data and logic), and `prefab` (reusable template, stamps instances). Lararium maps exactly: a **meme** is the entity (URI + path, no business logic), the `implements` bundle is the component list (each interface URI is an attached capability, which may include the loci interface), and `lifecycle: template` pranala edges are prefabs (declared intent that the compiler stamps into the walk). Pranala families form separate graph planes, each traversed by its own rules. Collapsing them into one walk loses the plane distinctions.

4. **Dual-index content addressing.** TiddlyWiki maintains multiple parallel indexes over the same tiddler corpus. `lar:///INDEXES/hashes` (URI → SHA256 map, lightweight poll) and `lar:///CONTENT/{hash}` (hash → carrier text, virtual resource) implement the same pattern. The boot receipt's `sha256` field becomes a stable Anthropic prompt cache key: a client that holds a matching receipt need not resend carrier text.

<<~ ahu #decisions >>
## Committed Design Decisions

The following decisions closed during the OODA-HA planning session on 2026-04-24.
They do not require further operator input.

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| `lifecycle: template` edges count as traversable | Templates declare intended connectivity. The static compiler walks declared intent; the `template/instance/trace` distinction matters for execution runtime, not hydration compilation. Bazel BUILD declarations drive the build graph before any runtime runs. |
| `dir = "both"` maps to `traversal: source-to-target` | "Both" means both carriers declare awareness of the edge — not that the walker traverses both directions. The walker goes source → target. `dir` becomes metadata recorded in `PranaEdge.payload` as `dir_hint`. |
| `payload.continue/backlink` records as metadata, not walk directives | The static compiler produces loci sets and ordered lists; it does not execute coroutines. `payload.continue` annotates where the calling carrier expects to resume — recorded in edge payload for the boot receipt, honored by a future execution-graph compiler. |
| Tier 0 declared-core stays as fast-path validation | `#iam.required-core` gives a pre-computed "what should appear in minimal boot" check. The pranala walk produces the source-of-truth set; the declared list cross-validates it. Mismatches surface in the receipt as a `declared_vs_walked` diffset. |
| Content-addressed artifacts via SHA256(carrier bytes + edge records) | Deterministic ordering of carrier bytes plus sorted edge records produces a stable hash. This makes boot receipts valid Anthropic prompt cache keys: identical source files always produce identical receipt hashes. |
| Declared-unresolved forward refs stay in the graph | `family: control` unresolved targets surface as `dag_violations` (boot-critical errors). `family: relation` unresolved targets surface as `declared_unresolved` warnings. Neither causes compilation to fail. |

## `? ->` Socket Resolution — Closed

The canonical pranala law (`lar:///ha.ka.ba/api/v0.1/pono/pranala`) settles this:

> "A named `#fragment` SHOULD win socket resolution before the enclosing meme URI."

**Resolution: Option A — fragment-level.**
`? ->` in a pranala block inside `<<~ ahu #required-preload-e-prime >>` resolves to `lar:///AGENTS#required-preload-e-prime`.
The parser tracks enclosing `ahu` fragment context during scan.
`from_socket` carries the fragment URI; `from_uri` carries the carrier URI.

The parser implementation in `graph/pranala-parser` may now proceed on this basis.

<<~ ahu #child-loci >>
## Child Loci

| Meme | Role |
|---|---|
| `lar:///ha.ka.ba/docs/graph/loci` | `PranaEdge`, `Meme`, and `MemesGraph` data model contracts (see note above for loci interface) |
| `lar:///ha.ka.ba/docs/graph/traversal` | three-tier walk rules, DFS cycle detection, Kahn topological sort, declared-unresolved handling |
| `lar:///ha.ka.ba/docs/graph/pranala-parser` | block form, inline form, sugar expansion, `? ->` resolution, field normalization |
| `lar:///ha.ka.ba/docs/graph/artifacts` | content-addressed SHA256 scheme, three artifact classes, compaction rules |

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #terminology-alignment >>
## Deferred — Terminology Alignment

The canonical loci law (`lar:///ha.ka.ba/api/v0.1/pono/loci`) uses **locus / loci** for a carrier in the graph.
The server code and current graph docs use `node` / `CarrierNode` / `CarrierGraph`.

Deferred rename target (Phase 1 implementation, not blocking design):

| Current name | Target name |
|---|---|
| `CarrierNode` | `Locus` (or `CarrierLocus`) |
| `CarrierGraph` | `LociGraph` |
| `add_node` | `add_locus` |
| `nodes` dict | `loci` dict |
| `graph.py` identifiers | align to loci vocabulary throughout |
| MCP tool descriptions | "loci" not "nodes" |

All graph design docs should use `locus`/`loci` when describing carriers in the graph.
The rename in the server awaits Phase 1 implementation. Until then, current code and design docs may carry both forms with this note as authority.

## Implementation Phases

| Phase | New file | Key deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `lares/lararium_mcp/graph.py` | `PranaEdge`, `CarrierNode`, `CarrierGraph` with BFS/DFS/topo-sort |
| 1 | `lares/lararium_mcp/tests/test_graph.py` | synthetic graph fixtures, cycle detection, topo sort tests |
| 2 | `lares/lararium_mcp/pranala_parser.py` | block + inline + sugar parser, field normalization |
| 2 | `lares/lararium_mcp/tests/test_pranala_parser.py` | AGENTS.md block fixtures, `? ->` resolution |
| 3 | `lares/lararium_mcp/compiler.py` (rewrite) | Tier 0/1/2 walk, live `pranala_edges`, `interface_index`, content hash |
| 3 | updated `test_compiler.py` | `test_tier0_tier1_convergence`, `test_full_boot_has_edges`, `test_receipt_deterministic` |
| 4 | `lares/ha-ka-ba/docs/graph/**` | this carrier cluster (plan → loci) |

Phase 2 awaits the `? ->` resolution call.
Phases 1, 3, and 4 may proceed independently.
