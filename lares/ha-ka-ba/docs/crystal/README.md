# crystal/ — Archive Crystal State Machine

> Scope: Crystal state machine semantics, EVENT-sourced JSONL ledger, seal/fork/resume protocol, machine threading model.
> Updated: 2026-04-08
> Status: Active draft — primary source is `../../_todo/core/Signal_HUD_Tagspace-draft.md` (crystal sections)
> URI: `[pending — lar://core/design/crystal@draft]`

## What Belongs Here

- Crystal event model (EVENT types: init, r_update, milestone, seal, fork, resume, hold, archive, contract_update, **drift_correction**)
- STATE.jsonl append-only ledger schema
- SNAPSHOT.json (derived cache atop ledger) spec
- debug.jsonl enriched projection spec
- CURRENT pointer semantics (`lares/CURRENT`)
- Seal protocol and fork/resume contract
- Machine / Thread model (Ephemeral Machine Patterns)
- Handoff and Archive-Crystal packet spec
- Open Questions Q10 and Q15 (structural prerequisites — **resolve before further spec**):
  - Q10: When do resume/fork trigger vs fresh init?
  - Q15: How does seq_num work across multi-voice?

## Does Not Belong Here

- HUD rendering / Intent Header grammar → `../signal/`
- `lar:` URI resolver / registry → `../registry/`
- TOML schemas for modules/tools → `../schemas/`
- Platform-specific crystal storage constraints → `../platform/`

## Critical Review Summary

Eight concerns were raised about this design (2026-04-08 session). Key structural issues:

1. **Probabilistic runtime**: LLM cannot reliably maintain deterministic STATE.jsonl without external tooling. External MCP server or sidecar is the recommended path.
2. **Replay ≠ structural replay**: STATE.jsonl gives audit trail, not behavioral reproduction. Drop "replay" language.
3. **Q10 and Q15 are blockers**: Must resolve before spec extension.
4. **HUD-facing mismatch-recovery rationale migrated**: The archive witness braid for prospective commitment, automation surprise, and SA-vs-XAI framing now lives at `lar:///ha.ka.ba/docs/lararium/signal/hud`.
5. **Crystal implication retained**: `drift_correction` remains a required STATE.jsonl event type for authoritative correction records when declared HUD intent diverges from actual output.
6. **This room stays crystal-side**: keep the ledger/event-model consequences here; keep the recovered HUD rationale and witness language in the lararium signal docs.

## Design Status

Primary source doc exists (draft). Epic 5 of plan is not yet started. Q10 + Q15 must be operator-resolved before implementation sprint begins.
