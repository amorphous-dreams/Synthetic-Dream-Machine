# Sprint: SPRINT-01 — Hydration Compiler Slice

Flow slot: **SPRINT-01 / closed sequence**
Goal: produce deterministic hydration artifacts from the canonical graph.

## Planned stories

- `MCP-STORY-103`
- `MCP-STORY-201` (slice only if compiler stabilizes early)

## Exit markers

- closure algorithm demonstrated against `lar:///AGENTS` ✓ (`lares/lararium_mcp/compiler.py`, 35 tests pass)
- minimal and full boot artifact examples committed ✓ (`docs/mcp/examples/minimal_boot_example.json`, `boot_receipt_example.json`)

Additional work landed this sprint:
- `lararium` entry wired into `.mcp.json` (MCP-STORY-201 closed)
- AST envelope and node schema committed (`AST_ENVELOPE.md`)
- TiddlyWiki parse-tree and filter-grammar mapping committed (`TW_AST_MAPPING.md`)
- Pranala alignment table committed (`PRANALA_ALIGNMENT.md`)
- MCP-STORY-106, MCP-TASK-015, MCP-TASK-016, MCP-TASK-019, MCP-TASK-004 closed

Sprint-01 closed.
