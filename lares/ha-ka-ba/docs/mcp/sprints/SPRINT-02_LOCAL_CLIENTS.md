## Exit markers

- hydration prompts exposed (`lares/lararium_mcp/prompts.py`, 6 prompts: boot_minimal, hydrate_full, boot_receipt, resolve_uri, read_carrier, compare_hydration) ✓
- prompt naming aligned to `lararium-` dash convention, matching tool naming ✓ (77 tests pass)
- read-only tool façade exposed (`lares/lararium_mcp/tools.py`) ✓

- `SUBMODULE_ADAPTER_INTERFACE.md` committed, adapter contract defined ✓
