✶ observe: the design stack separates identity, AST, execution, render, and inspection planes.
⏿ orient: TiddlyWiki grammar can inform guest syntax without taking over carrier law.
◇ decide: keep one envelope with explicit node families, graph-plane routing, and projection payloads.
▶ act: collapse AST, TW mapping, pranala alignment, execution, and render contracts into this locus.
⤴ verify: each transformation preserves source span, host/guest boundary, and target-specific payload shape.
↺ adapt: executable resources stay future-facing until parser and graph implementations land.

<<~ ahu #stack >>
## Four-Layer Stack

| Plane | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| identity / provenance | carriers, `lar:` addresses, `implements`, ratings, source truth |
| AST | memetic-wikitext primitives, guest grammar nodes, spans, annotations |
| execution | runtime node classes, dependencies, hooks, refresh semantics |
| render projection | target-specific payloads for DOM, tldraw, Kowloon, and trace views |
| inspection overlay | observe/debug projections and diagnostics over all planes |

Identity sits above the AST; carriers must validate before syntax lowers.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #ast-node-schema >>
## AST Node Schema

Core fields:

| Field | Reading |
|---|---|
| `id` | stable node identifier within one artifact |
| `type` | Lararium node family such as `ahu`, `pranala`, `guest.filter`, `text` |
| `source_uri` | carrier URI that yielded the node |
| `anchor` | local anchor or generated span key |
| `span` | source range with byte/line/column coordinates where available |
| `attrs` | typed node attributes |
| `children` | ordered child node ids |
| `diagnostics` | validation or lowering notices |

Span annotation remains mandatory for source-derived nodes and optional only for generated virtual nodes.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #primitive-map >>
## Primitive-to-Node Map

| Primitive | AST node family | Execution hint |
|---|---|---|
| `ahu` | `block.ahu` | scope / container |
| `loulou` | `edge.relation` | semantic adjacency |
| `aka` | `include.passive` | observe / shadow include |
| `kahea` | `invoke.active` | dataflow / invocation |
| `kapu` | `qualifier` | boundary or disclosure guard |
| `ui` | `query` | query/exploration node |
| `hana` | `guest.region` | bounded guest grammar parse site |
| `pranala` | `edge.pranala` | typed graph edge |
| `?` | `residue.unresolved` | uncertainty and backlog pressure |

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #tiddlywiki-boundary >>
## TiddlyWiki Filter Boundary

The v1 direct-import surface admits TiddlyWiki filter language as a guest grammar, not as host law.
Host terms translate into Lararium AST slots while preserving the original syntax span.

Boot-preserved filter families:

- title/reference selection
- tag/title/list field operators needed by boot inventory work
- simple string and field comparisons
- bounded transforms that do not require executing the whole TiddlyWiki runtime

Excluded from v1:

- arbitrary widget execution
- browser DOM lifecycle
- plugin side effects
- full wiki store semantics
- mutating filter operators

`tiddlywiki5` remains a reference submodule and parser comparator, not a runtime dependency for the core server.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #pranala-planes >>
## Pranala Graph-Plane Alignment

| Family | Primary plane | Compiler action |
|---|---|---|
| `control` | identity / provenance plus execution hierarchy | topological ordering and ownership |
| `relation` | identity / semantic adjacency | adjacency index; no boot block unless promoted by control |
| `dataflow` | AST → execution | live value transport edges |
| `message` | execution | event routing edges |
| `constraint` | validation layer, sometimes AST | post-resolution validation |
| `observe` | inspection overlay | debug and shadow surfaces |

`role` encodes lifetime pressure: `owns`, `composes`, `instantiates`, `references`, `constrains`.
`traversal` and `propagation` stay distinct; query walk direction must not collapse into invalidation direction.
Every family remains acyclic, except symmetric relation pairs may appear as two individually directed edges.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #execution-graph >>
## Execution Graph Contract

Execution nodes derive from validated AST and identity metadata.
Core fields include node id, class, source uri, scope, dependencies, hooks, refresh policy, state, and diagnostics.

Node classes:

| Class | Reading |
|---|---|
| carrier | source/loci lifecycle node |
| block | `ahu` or scoped body execution unit |
| invoke | active `kahea` / transclusion pressure |
| query | `ui` query surface |
| constraint | validation and guard node |
| render | projection seed |
| adapter | submodule or sidecar execution boundary |

Refresh semantics should distinguish source-change invalidation, dependency invalidation, explicit query refresh, and adapter health refresh.
Owned hierarchy follows control edges; parents resolve before owned children, and teardown proceeds child before parent.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #render-projection >>
## Render Projection Contract

Render projections transform execution/AST facts into target payloads without mutating source truth.

| Target | Payload posture |
|---|---|
| DOM | HTML-ish node tree with attributes, text, and diagnostics |
| tldraw | shape records, bindings, geometry hints, and metadata |
| Kowloon | scene/entity graph payload with transform, components, and relations |
| trace | compact inspection events for diagnostics and replay |

Projection nodes carry `target`, `source_node`, `payload`, `diagnostics`, and provenance fields.
The v1 posture stays read-only; write-back to tldraw, Kowloon, or DOM remains blocked until tool policy changes.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #mcp-exposure >>
## MCP Exposure Targets

Future resources may include:

- `lar:///ast/{uri}` for AST envelopes
- `lar:///exec/{uri}` for execution graphs
- `lar:///render/{target}/{uri}` for projection payloads
- `lar:///graph/pranala` for typed edge inventory

These remain planned surfaces; current server focuses on carrier resources, indexes, boot artifacts, tools, and prompts.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #residue >>
## Residue

- Parser implementation has not yet landed.
- Full graph resources have not yet landed.
- Render target field matrices for some submodule surfaces remain open subtasks.
- Guest grammar admission should stay narrow until tests cover filter feature subsets.
