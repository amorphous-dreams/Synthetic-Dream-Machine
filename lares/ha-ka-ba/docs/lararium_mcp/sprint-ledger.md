✶ observe: the closed sprint docs mostly name exits and pointers to design contracts.
⏿ orient: canonical children now carry the durable design content; this ledger carries completion memory.
◇ decide: keep closed sprint outcomes compact and point each consumed source to its new locus.
▶ act: mark Sprint-00 through Sprint-02 as consumed; keep Sprint-03 live outside this ledger.
⤴ verify: every closed-sprint exit marker appears here or in the child locus named by the map.
↺ adapt: future sprint docs enter this ledger only after closure.

## Closed Sprint Outcomes

Sprint IDs mark ordered work slices, not wall-clock promises.

| Sprint | Goal | Exit contraction |
|---|---|---|
| SPRINT-00 | contraction, inventory, boundary | submodule matrix, TiddlyWiki filter boundary, boot inventory, edge taxonomy, artifact contract closed |
| SPRINT-01 | hydration compiler slice | closure algorithm demonstrated, boot examples committed, AST/TW/pranala design added, local resource spine started |
| SPRINT-02 | local client surfaces | prompts, tools, VS Code, Claude Code, Codex local config, and adapter contract closed |

Active or not-yet-consumed sources: `SPRINT-03_REMOTE_SURFACES.md`, `SPRINT-04_HARDENING.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, `WORK_TRACKING.md`, active todo story/task/subtask documents, and research notes.

## Done Story Index

These done stories have their durable content represented by the canonical loci above or by the implemented code they point at:

| Story | Canonical landing |
|---|---|
| MCP-STORY-101, 102, 103 | `hydration` |
| MCP-STORY-104, 204 | `adapters` |
| MCP-STORY-105, 106, 107, 108 | `ast-execution-render` |
| MCP-STORY-109, 110, 111 | `carrier-law`, `hydration`, `spine` |
| MCP-STORY-201, 202, 203 | `hydration`, `local-clients` |
| MCP-STORY-401, 402, 403 | `local-clients` |

Individual story stubs may remain as issue-style trace records; they no longer need to carry design truth.

## Residue

- Sprint-03 carries remote transport, auth/scope policy, evals, and pranala DAG walking.
- Sprint-04 carries hardening and operations.
- When a future sprint closes, add one row here and mark its source file consumed.
