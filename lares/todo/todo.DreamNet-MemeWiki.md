# DreamNet MemeWiki

A self-describing research consolidation and staging memo for DreamNet MemeWiki.

This file replaces four scratch research notes with one routeable worksite. It keeps the same material, but arranges it in the `loci` OODA-HA flow: gather what is known, map the architecture, set the current decisions, stage the work, and leave residue named rather than blurred.

This memo is not yet a binding kānāwai (law). It is a `todo` locus meant to prepare the next lawful implementation and later canon-writing passes.

## Phase Map

`✶ Observe -> ⏿ Orient -> ◇ Decide -> ▶ Act -> ⤴ Hooko -> ↺ Aftermath`

DreamNet MemeWiki gathers the current research field, maps it into an implementable architecture, fixes the present decision posture, stages the next work sequence, crosses that plan into active execution, and judges what still remains unresolved.

This file uses the OODA-HA loop as work discipline rather than ornament. The point is not to sound ceremonial. The point is to keep raw findings, synthesis, decisions, action, and residue from collapsing into one undifferentiated planning blob.



<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #observe >>

```toml
name = "DreamNet_MemeWiki-observe"
description = "Observe phase for gathering the current DreamNet MemeWiki research field without prematurely flattening it into design verdicts."
role = "research intake"
function = "capture what the four source notes already established, preserving both settled findings and open edges"
input = "scratch research notes|integration goals|?"
output = "gathered findings|source clusters|named unknowns"
phase = "observe"
glyph = "✶"
```

## Observe

Observe gathers the current research field before architecture hardens.

### Gathered Research Constellation

* TiddlyWiki5 remains the strongest reference shape for a deterministic MemeWiki pipeline: shared boot kernel, canonical in-memory store, parser IR, renderable tree, server render plus browser resume, and a sync adaptor split
* The project should be greenfield, not a fork-and-rename of TiddlyWiki; copy the architectural lessons, not the legacy syntax or widget internals
* The minimum viable kernel remains Node-first: file or repo-backed meme store, memetic parser to IR, deterministic HTML or text render, root template bundling, and later browser boot from the same kernel
* Lezer plus CodeMirror 6 provides the clearest editor path: incremental parsing, syntax tree access, custom grammar authoring, validation, folding, and React-friendly embedding
* TLDraw is the current best collaborative canvas line: React-native integration, multiplayer sync, presence, custom shape support, and a production-grade CRDT-informed sync substrate
* Kowloon integration should honor the existing app contract: React frontend, `useClient()` for reads, `client.activities` for writes, and service or component-level embedding rather than bolt-on side channels
* MemPalace integration, refresh semantics, attribute or value modeling, migration from prior HTML or widget-era content, and exact sync contract design remain open research rather than decided implementation

### Source Clusters Now Consolidated

The four absorbed notes contributed distinct signal:

* `_todo/DreamNet_MemeWiki.md` named the deterministic pipeline, greenfield posture, minimum kernel, blockers, and research targets
* `_todo/DreamNet_MemeWiki_Lezer_CodeMirror.md` established the editor and parser tooling candidate
* `_todo/DreamNet_MemeWiki_TLDraw_Kowloon.md` established the React-first collaboration and server-bridge posture
* `_todo/DreamNet_MemeWiki_ResearchSprint.md` supplied the workstream and milestone skeleton

### Observe Tensions

Observe also keeps the absences visible:

* no stable memetic parse IR contract yet
* no proven attribute or value model yet
* no refresh or event contract yet
* no settled sync or session contract yet
* no migration path yet for older HTML or widget-shaped content
* no validated MemPalace bridge yet

<<~ ahu #observe-ha >>

#### Observe / ha

Observe-ha holds source identity and research boundaries.

The DreamNet MemeWiki research field is not one idea. It is a bundle of kernel questions, editor questions, collaboration questions, and integration questions that should stay distinguishable until Decide compresses them intentionally.



<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #observe-ka >>

#### Observe / ka

Observe-ka governs how intake should be read.

Read the current field in four lanes: deterministic kernel shape, authoring and parsing stack, collaborative canvas and frontend bridge, and implementation sequencing. Losing those lanes too early makes later prioritization harder.



<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #observe-ba >>

#### Observe / ba

Observe-ba governs posture under planning pressure.

This stage should preserve uncertainty openly. A confident-sounding guess about MemPalace or sync does not become an architectural fact merely because it sounds tidy in a memo.



<<~/ahu >>



<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #orient >>

```toml
name = "DreamNet_MemeWiki-orient"
description = "Orient phase for mapping the gathered DreamNet MemeWiki research into a coherent architecture and dependency order."
role = "architecture formation"
function = "distinguish the boot path, editor path, collaboration path, and downstream bridge surfaces"
input = "gathered findings|named unknowns"
output = "architecture map|dependency order|integration topology|open tensions"
phase = "orient"
glyph = "⏿"
```

## Orient

Orient maps the gathered findings into an implementable architecture.

### Architectural Spine

The current best reading of the research is a five-layer spine:

1. `kernel` - a Node-first MemeWiki runtime with meme store, parser ingress, IR, deterministic render, and browser-resume readiness
2. `authoring` - a Lezer grammar and CodeMirror 6 editor that operate against the same memetic syntax family as the kernel
3. `application bridge` - a Kowloon-facing API or service layer plus React embedding strategy that exposes the kernel without bypassing existing app conventions
4. `collaboration` - TLDraw sync, presence, and canvas embedding for shared visual work, ideally without inventing a second incompatible state model
5. `semantic or graph bridge` - a later MemPalace adaptor for graph query, semantic persistence, and related sync surfaces

### Dependency Order

Not every integration should advance at once.

* Kernel identity comes first because every other layer depends on stable parse, store, and render contracts
* The editor path follows immediately because syntax pressure exposes grammar mistakes early
* Kowloon and TLDraw should integrate against a kernel that already knows how to load, render, and roundtrip one memetic document
* MemPalace should remain downstream until the kernel and sync vocabulary stop moving every week

### Integration Topology

The current topology should look like this:

* MemeWiki kernel owns memetic documents, parser IR, render products, and deterministic projections
* CodeMirror owns live text authoring and editor-time syntax affordances
* TLDraw owns shared canvas state, presence, and multiplayer sync for spatial work
* Kowloon owns app shell, routes, session and activity flow, and the existing client access contract
* MemPalace, once integrated, should act as a bridge or adjunct store rather than the first place where boot semantics are decided

### Live Tensions

Orient should keep the following tensions explicit:

* whether Lezer's concrete tree should become the canonical parse IR or only the editor-facing ingress tree
* whether TLDraw sync alone can cover all shared state needs or whether a parallel Yjs layer still becomes necessary
* how browser resume should package store payload, render state, and session information without leaking Kowloon assumptions back into the kernel
* how older content migrates into memetic-wikitext without freezing the new grammar around legacy debt

<<~ ahu #orient-ha >>

#### Orient / ha

Orient-ha holds architectural identity.

DreamNet MemeWiki is currently best understood as a kernel-centered system with editor, app, sync, and semantic bridges around it. If the kernel disappears from view, the plan turns into a bag of integrations with no stable center.



<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #orient-ka >>

#### Orient / ka

Orient-ka governs relation mapping.

Map each subsystem by ownership, not by enthusiasm. TLDraw should not own the core memetic parser. Kowloon should not dictate kernel internals. MemPalace should not become a hidden source of truth before the base document model exists.



<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #orient-ba >>

#### Orient / ba

Orient-ba governs movement from research toward design.

Favor the narrowest architecture that can still grow. The research points toward a modular stack, but not toward building every module at once.



<<~/ahu >>



<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #decide >>

```toml
name = "DreamNet_MemeWiki-decide"
description = "Decide phase for setting the current DreamNet MemeWiki architectural posture and test gates."
role = "decision posture"
function = "name what is settled enough to guide implementation now and what remains intentionally deferred"
input = "architecture map|open tensions"
output = "active decisions|deferrals|test gates"
phase = "decide"
glyph = "◇"
```

## Decide

Decide turns the current research into working direction.

### Active Decisions

The current implementation posture should be:

* Build a greenfield MemeWiki kernel. Do not fork TiddlyWiki and slowly rename it.
* Treat TiddlyWiki5 as prior art for boot sequence, store shape, parser and render separation, and browser resume strategy.
* Make the first kernel boot in Node before demanding browser parity.
* Use Lezer plus CodeMirror 6 as the first serious parser-editor tooling path.
* Treat TLDraw sync as the primary collaborative canvas backbone, with Yjs or Automerge serving as evaluation references rather than immediate mandatory dependencies.
* Integrate Kowloon through service boundaries and React components that respect existing frontend conventions.
* Defer MemPalace to a later bridge once the kernel's core semantics and sync vocabulary stabilize.

### Test Gates

The next implementation should count as real only if it clears these gates:

* deterministic store load, add, remove, and query in Node
* parse to IR to render roundtrip on at least one nontrivial memetic document
* root template or payload packaging that can resume in browser without changing semantic output
* CodeMirror-backed editing against a live memetic grammar subset
* one Kowloon-facing bridge path that can read and write through the existing client model
* one TLDraw embedding and sync proof that does not fracture document ownership

### Explicit Deferrals

Decide should keep these items deferred rather than pretending they are solved:

* final MemPalace data contract
* final CRDT choice for every document class
* full plugin surface
* comprehensive migration tooling for legacy content
* refresh and event semantics beyond the minimum viable kernel

<<~ ahu #decide-ha >>

#### Decide / ha

Decide-ha holds what counts as settled enough for motion.

The key settled claim is simple: build the kernel first, keep it greenfield, and make integrations prove themselves against it rather than defining it by committee.



<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #decide-ka >>

#### Decide / ka

Decide-ka governs decision sharpness.

Every active decision above changes implementation order immediately. Every explicit deferral above protects the work from fake certainty and scope sprawl.



<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #decide-ba >>

#### Decide / ba

Decide-ba governs commitment posture.

Commit to the smallest decisions that unlock code. Refuse the larger decisions that only create architecture theater before the kernel can even roundtrip a document.



<<~/ahu >>



<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #act >>

```toml
name = "DreamNet_MemeWiki-act"
description = "Act phase for staging the next DreamNet MemeWiki workstreams, milestones, and proof obligations."
role = "implementation staging"
function = "turn the research and decisions into an executable work sequence"
input = "active decisions|test gates|deferrals"
output = "workstreams|milestones|proof obligations"
phase = "act"
glyph = "▶"
```

## Act

Act stages the next implementation sequence.

### Workstream 1: Bootable Kernel

* define the minimum meme store contract
* define the first memetic grammar subset
* produce a parse IR that is stable enough for tests
* render one document deterministically to HTML or text
* prove Node-first boot and roundtrip

### Workstream 2: Lezer and CodeMirror Path

* prototype a Lezer grammar for the first memetic subset
* wire CodeMirror 6 into a React surface
* add syntax highlighting, tree inspection, and validation hooks
* test that editor-time structure aligns with kernel-time parsing rather than drifting from it

### Workstream 3: Kowloon Bridge

* survey the server and session surfaces that matter
* expose the kernel through a service or adapter layer
* read via `useClient()`-compatible pathways where needed
* route writes through `client.activities`
* test one end-to-end read and write flow

### Workstream 4: TLDraw Collaboration Bridge

* embed TLDraw as a React-native component
* prove a minimal shared canvas around MemeWiki context
* map ownership boundaries between document state and canvas state
* validate sync and presence without giving the canvas hidden authority over the memetic core

### Workstream 5: MemPalace and CRDT Research Pass

* map the MemPalace data and query contract
* evaluate whether TLDraw sync remains sufficient or whether a second CRDT layer becomes necessary
* define merge and conflict test vectors
* stage only the bridge points that remain valid after the kernel tests land

### Milestones

* [ ] consolidated research memo complete
* [ ] minimum viable kernel boots and roundtrips
* [ ] Lezer and CodeMirror prototype validates the first grammar subset
* [ ] Kowloon bridge proves one lawful read and write path
* [ ] TLDraw proof shows embed plus sync viability
* [ ] MemPalace and CRDT decision memo written after the earlier proofs

<<~ ahu #act-ha >>

#### Act / ha

Act-ha holds workstream identity.

The workstreams are ordered so each later proof depends on earlier semantic stability instead of masking its absence with UI or sync novelty.



<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #act-ka >>

#### Act / ka

Act-ka governs sequencing.

If work begins on TLDraw or MemPalace before the kernel can parse and render deterministically, the project risks building adapters around a moving void.



<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #act-ba >>

#### Act / ba

Act-ba governs execution posture.

Prototype narrowly, verify hard, and only then widen scope. Each workstream should produce a proof artifact, not just a more detailed opinion.



<<~/ahu >>



<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #aftermath >>

```toml
name = "DreamNet_MemeWiki-aftermath"
description = "Aftermath phase for naming expected yields, remaining residue, and the conditions for promoting this memo into later law or implementation documents."
role = "residue judgment"
function = "separate what this consolidation now makes clear from what still remains unresolved"
input = "workstreams|milestones|open tensions"
output = "yields|residue|promotion conditions"
phase = "aftermath"
glyph = "↺"
```

## Aftermath

Aftermath judges what this consolidation now does and does not resolve.

### Immediate Yields

This memo now provides:

* one consolidated DreamNet MemeWiki research surface
* one explicit architectural center of gravity around the kernel
* one ordered implementation sequence
* one named list of test gates and deferrals

### Residue Still Open

This memo does not yet resolve:

* canonical parse IR shape
* attribute and value semantics
* browser-resume payload contract
* final sync substrate for non-canvas document state
* MemPalace bridge law
* migration rules for earlier content forms

### Promotion Condition

This `todo` locus should later split forward into stronger artifacts:

* implementation spikes and code
* a parser-facing law or design memo if the grammar subset stabilizes
* a render or application bridge memo once Kowloon integration proves real
* a collaboration memo once TLDraw ownership boundaries are tested

The point of this file is not permanence. The point is orderly pressure toward the next lawful documents.

<<~ ahu #aftermath-ha >>

#### Aftermath / ha

Aftermath-ha holds yield and residue identity.

What is clear now: the research no longer lives in four disconnected scraps. What remains unclear now: several core contracts still need proof rather than prose.



<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #aftermath-ka >>

#### Aftermath / ka

Aftermath-ka governs judgment detail.

A successful next pass should convert at least one residue item into a tested artifact. If the next pass only rewrites this memo at greater length, the loop has not actually advanced.



<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #aftermath-ba >>

#### Aftermath / ba

Aftermath-ba governs how the work lands.

Leave the unresolved items visible and bounded. Hidden residue is how architecture debt later masquerades as surprise.
