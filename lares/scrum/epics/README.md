# `lares/scrum/epics/` — Epic Registry

> Scope: Named design epics. Each epic maps to a thematic work domain spanning one or more sprints.
> Updated: 2026-04-09
> Status: `[S:0.65]` 🏛️ — epic directories seeded; task items migrating from roadmap backlog

## The Lindwyrm Narrative — Multi-Epic Story Canon

The Lindwyrm's origin story is the **narrative track** of all epics combined. It lives here at the epic root because it spans the full arc — not any single domain.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`LINDWYRM_STORY_SHAPE.md`](LINDWYRM_STORY_SHAPE.md) | Format spec: DreamDeck feed archive, JackPoint/Shadowtalk style; cast; rendering targets; post-header conventions |
| [`LINDWYRM_ORIGIN_OUTLINE.md`](LINDWYRM_ORIGIN_OUTLINE.md) | Story beats: three-thread braid (Lindwyrm's Thread / Wild Mage's Thread / Crossing Thread); per-act outline |

Each epic's README records its narrative beat — the Elyncia-side story moment that corresponds to the technical work of that epic. When the technical work closes and the story beat is polished, the Ink-Clerk promotes it to `[C:0.99]` story-canon.

Epic beat → sprint Aftermath → story-canon commit. That is the closing sequence.

## Backlog Item Namespace Convention

Epic folder name = backlog item prefix namespace. `SIG-05` lives in `SIGNAL/`. `CRY-13` lives in `CRYSTAL/`. No lookup required — the folder IS the namespace.

Items without a prefix (cross-epic, spike, research) live in `lares/scrum/sprints/spikes/` or at the sprints root, not in an epic folder.
