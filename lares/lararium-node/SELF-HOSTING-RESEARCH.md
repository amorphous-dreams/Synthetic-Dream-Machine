## Scouting Question

How do canonical "everything including the system IS an editable object IN the system" architectures actually accomplish this? What mechanisms, invariants, bootstrap tricks, and failure modes do they rely on?

Five systems scouted: TiddlyWiki 5, Smalltalk/Pharo, Emacs Lisp, Oberon, Self VM.

<<~ ahu #tw5-deep >>

## TW5 — Shadow Tiddler Read-Through

**Mechanism:** Core modules (`$:/core/modules/parser`, `$:/core/ui/ViewTemplate`, etc.) live as *shadow tiddlers* — read-only system objects embedded as JSON in the boot HTML. User tiddlers with the same name overlay the shadow; the shadow provides the safe canonical fallback. Shadow tiddlers always exist even if user data is corrupted.

**Bootstrap trick:** Boot phase 1 uses hard-coded JavaScript (the kernel) to unmarshal shadow tiddlers from embedded JSON. Boot phase 2 uses the shadow parser to parse user tiddlers. The kernel never uses its own parser for its own loading — the parser only becomes active after shadows are resident. Phase 1 and Phase 2 are cleanly separated.

**Invariant:** Shadow tiddlers are never shown in the normal edit UI — only via a special `$:/ControlPanel` inspector. The underlying store separation (shadow store vs user store) is never bridged.

**Failure mode:** User incorrectly edits a shadow module → parse failure on next reload. Recovery: shadow layer always regenerable from embedded HTML core. User store is stored separately (browser localStorage or file) and can be blown away without losing the kernel.

**Lararium adoption:** The `lares/ha.ka.ba/api/v0.1/` carriers form the shadow layer. Grammar memes in `lares/grammars/` form the shadow grammar. User-authored carriers can OVERRIDE grammar rules at a different URI but cannot DELETE the shadow grammar. `loadGrammarRules()` reads the shadow grammar; user overrides layer on top. `/admin/reseed` is safe because shadow grammar regenerates from `lares/` on every compile — it is the embedded JSON equivalent.

<<~ ahu #smalltalk-image >>

## Smalltalk / Pharo — Method Dictionary Mutation

**Mechanism:** Every class carries a *method dictionary* — a hash table from selector symbol to compiled method object. `defun` equivalent = overwriting a method dictionary entry. The method lookup algorithm walks the dictionary chain upward through superclasses. Because method lookup is an algorithm (C kernel), not a table entry, it cannot be overwritten by user code.

**Bootstrap trick:** The cold image contains a minimal pre-compiled binary. Booting from cold = deserializing the image binary, which contains all class/method objects including the compiler. No source files needed — the image IS the source and the compiled form simultaneously.

**Invariant:** The message-dispatch mechanism (the C-level `send` instruction) is inviolable. Users can redefine ANY method, even `Object>>doesNotUnderstand:`, but the act of dispatching a message to a method dictionary entry remains immutable primitive behavior.

**Failure mode:** Circular class hierarchy or broken `doesNotUnderstand` → infinite loop / system lockup. Recovery: image snapshot from before the bad edit; Smalltalk has a cultural practice of frequent image saves before risky edits.

**Lararium adoption:** `parsePranalaEdges()` = the method dictionary lookup algorithm — immutable kernel. `GrammarRules` = the method dictionary contents — fully replaceable at each compile. Phase 2.5 wires this: the parser receives `GrammarRules` as runtime data, reads patterns from it, falls back to built-ins when entries are missing. The interpretation engine (how a regex pattern fires against text) = the C kernel. The patterns themselves = the method dictionary.

<<~ ahu #emacs-lisp >>

## Emacs — C Kernel / Lisp Surface Boundary

**Mechanism:** C kernel owns: buffer model, event loop, character I/O, symbol table. Lisp surface owns: all user-visible behavior — keybindings, modes, commands, display logic. `defun` adds or replaces a symbol's function definition. At call time, the symbol is resolved from the symbol table to its current definition — late binding means any `defun` immediately affects future calls.

**Bootstrap trick:** Emacs dumps a "temacs" binary (C kernel + minimal Lisp). The `loadup.el` file then loads all Lisp source files in order to build the final `emacs` binary (via `make-docfile` and `unexec`). The result is a new binary with the Lisp state baked in. This is the Emacs equivalent of "embedding shadow tiddlers."

**Invariant:** Primitive C functions (`backward-char`, `insert-char`, etc.) are protected — Lisp can advise them (wrap) but not replace their C body. The symbol table lookup mechanism itself is C-level and immutable.

**Failure mode:** Redefining a primitive that is called deep in core logic → cascading failures. Recovery: `M-x load-file` to reload the correct definition; Emacs survives most such errors because broken defuns are only called on demand, not eagerly.

**Lararium adoption:** `resolveLarUri()` + `parsePranalaEdges()` interpretation engine = C kernel — must never be mutable from the lares/ tree. Everything above: grammar patterns, family contracts, template definitions, layout strategies = Lisp surface = editable memes. The `advice` pattern maps to Lararium's future "meme override" system: a user meme at a different URI can wrap a grammar sigil's behavior without replacing the shadow grammar.

<<~ ahu #oberon-self-vm >>

## Oberon / Self VM — Module Versioning and Live Reload

**Oberon mechanism:** Modules compile to descriptors containing entry points and dependency pointers. Loading a new module version patches the descriptor in-place; callers holding references to the old descriptor continue working until GC reclaims them. Module interfaces (exported types and functions) are versioned — incompatible interface changes are detected at load time and rejected.

**Self VM mechanism:** Self uses a prototype-based object model (no classes) where every object has a parent slot. The parent chain is the equivalent of Smalltalk's class hierarchy. Objects are cloned and mutated directly; "cloning" is the equivalent of TW5's "create a tiddler from a shadow." The Self image is persistent — a running Self system IS the persisted state.

**Lararium adoption from Oberon:** Grammar meme versioning via boot receipt SHA. Each time `lares/grammars/memetic-wikitext.md` changes, a new `receiptSha` results — tracked in `BootReceipt`. Old grammar rules remain available in git history. Future: the `GrammarRules` object carries a version hash; if the running grammar version differs from the requested version, the server can reseed.

**Lararium adoption from Self:** The prototype chain maps cleanly to Lararium's meme override model. A user meme at `lar:///user:joshu@local/grammars/memetic-wikitext` extends the shadow grammar at `lar:///grammars/memetic-wikitext` — same override pattern as Self's parent slot.

## Synthesis — The Four Laws for Lararium Self-Hosting

From the five systems, four mechanisms converge:

| Mechanism | Source | Lararium form |
|---|---|---|
| Shadow layer (read-only defaults) | TW5 | `lares/ha.ka.ba/api/v0.1/` + `lares/grammars/` — regenerable from lares/, never deletable via canvas edit |
| Method dictionary mutation | Smalltalk | `GrammarRules` object — loaded fresh on each `compileMinimalBoot()`, passed to parser as runtime data |
| C kernel / Lisp surface | Emacs | `resolveLarUri()` + parse dispatch = C kernel; all grammar patterns + family contracts + templates = Lisp surface |
| Module versioning | Oberon | `BootReceipt.sha256` — each grammar change produces a new receipt; old versions recoverable from git |

**The critical insight from bootstrapping:**

Every system uses a two-phase boot:
1. Phase 1 (kernel): hard-coded, cannot use itself to load itself
2. Phase 2 (surface): uses Phase 1 output to load the surface layer

Lararium maps exactly:
- Phase 1: TypeScript hard-coded parser reads `lares/` files — builds the boot closure
- Phase 2: Boot closure contains `lares/grammars/memetic-wikitext.md` — `GrammarRules` object passed to parser for subsequent parses in the SAME boot
- Phase 3 (future): Parser module itself lives in `lares/`; Phase 1 only runs during cold bootstrap

**The invariant that must hold at all phases:**

`resolveLarUri()` — the mechanism that translates a `lar:///` string to a file path or virtual marker — is the inviolable C kernel. It must NEVER be modified by a meme. Everything else is fair game.

<<~ ahu #phase-2-5-implication >>

## Direct Implication for Phase 2.5

Phase 2.5 wires `GrammarRules` into `parsePranalaEdges`. The correct form from the research:

1. `parsePranalaEdges(uri, text, grammar?)` — optional third arg
2. When `grammar` present: resolve each sigil's regex pattern from `grammar.sigils` lookup, fall back to hard-coded constant if missing
3. When `grammar` present: validate edges against `grammar.families` contracts instead of `FAMILY_CONTRACTS` map
4. `buildControlClosure()` in `node-host.ts` calls `loadGrammarRules()` once before the walk, passes the result to a grammar-aware `loadMeme()` variant
5. All existing two-arg call sites continue working unchanged — the optional arg preserves backward compat

This is the Smalltalk method dictionary pattern: the parser algorithm (dispatch engine) stays fixed; the rule table it reads becomes externally supplied data.
