## ATProto OAuth Position

Bluesky login means ATProto OAuth.

ATProto OAuth profile requirements (mandatory, not optional):
- Authorization-code flow only
- PKCE (S256 only — `plain` is prohibited)
- PAR (Pushed Authorization Requests)
- DPoP (Demonstrating Proof of Possession)
- DPoP proofs are per-request
- DPoP uses server-issued nonces
- Authorization server nonce and PDS/resource server nonce are tracked separately
- ES256 / P-256 key support required
- `atproto` scope must be requested
- Token `sub` must match the expected DID
- PDS / issuer authority must be verified

Do not manually implement any item on this list.
The official ATProto SDK (`@atproto/oauth-client-*`) owns this boundary entirely.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #bff-preferred-flow >>

## Preferred Architecture: BFF

Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) / server-managed OAuth.

```
Browser ──── application session cookie ──── BFF (Node.js server)
                                                │
                                    @atproto/oauth-client-node
                                                │
                                         ATProto PDS / AS
```

- Use `@atproto/oauth-client-node` for server-side / BFF flows
- OAuth session material (tokens, DPoP keys) stays server-side
- Frontend receives an application session cookie or Lararium session reference
- Frontend never receives raw OAuth authority or DPoP keys by default
- This is the confidential-client posture

Rationale:
- DPoP private keys should not live in browser storage
- Token refresh complexity is server-contained
- BFF can enforce trust-tier checks before forwarding requests
- Matches ATProto's own recommended architecture for web apps

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #browser-fallback-flow >>

## Allowed Fallback: Browser-Only Login

Browser-only / public-client login using `@atproto/oauth-client-browser`.

**Label this explicitly as public-client risk posture.**

Rules when using browser-only flow:
- Do not store long-lived secrets or refresh tokens in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`
- Do not treat browser-only login as equivalent to confidential-client BFF login
- Use session-scoped memory where possible
- Accept and document the security degradation
- Consider this appropriate for: personal tools, desktop-adjacent browser contexts,
  or development environments where BFF infrastructure is not available

Do not use browser-only login as the default production architecture.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #identity-layers >>

## Identity Layer Separation

Keep these layers strictly distinct. None may collapse into another.

```
Human-visible Bluesky handle          (input, not identity — must be resolved)
  ↓ resolve
DID                                   (authoritative identity, from OAuth token sub)
  ↓ discovery
PDS / issuer / authorization server   (authority over the DID's data)
  ↓ OAuth flow
OAuth session                         (access token, refresh token, DPoP keys)
  ↓ application layer
Lararium session                      (application-level session, issued by BFF/server)
  ↓ runtime addressing
Lararium alias:tier@host              (hostful URI — runtime / deployment claim)
  ↓ invariant identity
lar:///... hostless meme URI          (canonical Lararium identity — no host, no session)
```

Rules:
- A handle starts login but must not become final identity. Resolve and verify via OAuth.
- The token `sub` must match the expected DID after OAuth completes.
- `alias:tier@host` may map to an ATProto identity, but must not collapse into it.
  A deployment alias is not a DID. A DID is not an alias.
- Hostful runtime claims (`lar://alias:tier@host/...`) must not override
  hostless invariant meme identity (`lar:///...`).
- Lararium session tokens are application-layer; they are not OAuth tokens.
- PDS/resource server authority must be checked — do not accept unverified issuer claims.

<<~ ahu #dpop-boundary >>

## DPoP Boundary

Default: let `@atproto/oauth-client-*` manage DPoP entirely.

If direct DPoP handling ever becomes necessary (formal reviewed exception required):
- Generate an ES256 / P-256 key pair per OAuth session
- Do not reuse DPoP keys across users or sessions
- Prefer non-extractable private keys where the runtime and SDK allow
- Track nonce separately for authorization server and PDS/resource server
- Retry only according to SDK/spec behavior when nonce rotation requires it
- Never hand-roll DPoP inside `lararium-core` or `lararium-web`
- Any direct DPoP code belongs in a dedicated auth-boundary package, not core

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #storage-policy >>

## Storage Policy

Server-side (BFF path):
- OAuth session material: server memory or server-side session store
- DPoP keys: server-side, non-extractable where possible
- Application session: `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict` cookie

Browser-only path (fallback):
- Use session-scoped memory (`Map` in module scope) where possible
- Do not store DPoP private keys in `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or IndexedDB
- Do not store refresh tokens in browser storage if avoidable
- Document any deviation from this policy explicitly

General:
- No long-lived secrets in browser storage
- No raw token material in URL parameters or fragment identifiers
- PKCE state and nonces: memory-only during the OAuth flow; discard after use

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #curve-policy >>

## Curve Policy

Use **P-256 / ES256** where ATProto OAuth / DPoP requires it.

Do not implement k256 / secp256k1 in Lararium.

ATProto supports both p256 and k256 generally, but:
- k256 is not Web Crypto-native (requires a reviewed third-party library)
- P-256 covers all current mandatory ATProto OAuth requirements
- k256 is out of scope unless a formal reviewed dependency (official ATProto lib) owns it

If repo signing or ATProto data-auth work later requires k256:
- Use official ATProto libraries or a reviewed dependency
- Do not implement k256 operations in `lararium-core`

## Known Risks and Deferred Decisions

| Risk | Status | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Browser-only login exposes session to XSS | Accepted for fallback path | Label explicitly; prefer BFF |
| DPoP nonce rotation complexity | Deferred to SDK | Do not re-implement |
| k256 if ATProto data-auth requires it | Deferred | Reviewed dep only |
| Trust-tier ordering for hostful claims | Doctrine defined (see lar-uri.md) | Enforce at BFF layer |
| Handle-to-DID resolution latency | Accepted | Async flow; never cache handles as identity |
| OAuth session expiry in long-running sessions | Deferred | SDK refresh + BFF session extension |

Implementation milestone: see `lar:///LARARIUM-NODE/ROADMAP` Milestone 4.
No ATProto login implementation this milestone — doctrine only.
