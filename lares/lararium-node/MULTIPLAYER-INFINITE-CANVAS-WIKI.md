# Lararium Multiplayer Infinite-Canvas Wiki

Lararium is a **local-first memetic wiki** with two live UX projections over the same tiddler corpus: TW5 wiki UX and tldraw infinite-canvas UX.

`lares/` is canon. The live room corpus is an Automerge document synced through `/meme-sync` and materialized into a room-scoped `LarariumTW5` instance. The canvas is a projection/edit lens over that TW5-backed corpus, not an independent source of meme truth.

What this system is now:
- An Automerge meme/tiddler store (`AutomergeMemeStore`) with IndexedDB on the browser, NodeFS on the server, and `/meme-sync` peer sync.
- A room-scoped TW5 semantic VM: filters, cascade rules, parser bridge, render previews, and the TW5 sync adaptor all operate over the same CRDT-backed tiddlers.
- A tldraw projection layer (`@lararium/tldraw` + `projectFromTw5()`) that derives pages/shapes/bindings from the TW5 corpus in the browser.
- A canon-promotion boundary: live edits may update Automerge/TW5, but `lares/` changes require explicit operator ceremony (`PUT /admin/promote` today, Orichalcum gate target).
- A multi-room HTTP shell (`/room/:roomId`) for route/capability/view scope. Current content storage is still one server meme-store document; per-room recipes are the next partitioning layer.
- A legacy/layout WebSocket surface (`/rooms/:roomId`, `TLSocketRoom` + `SQLiteSyncStorage`) still present in `serve.ts`, but no longer the primary meme-content path used by the browser canvas.
- An identity-addressed content model: persistent corpus units use `lar:` URI titles.

What this system is not:
- A TW5 shadow-tiddler overwrite system. TW5 is a first-class semantic binding layer, but canonical carrier law remains in Lararium parser/store/promotion contracts.
- A tldraw/SQLite source-of-truth store for meme content. tldraw records are projections and layout overlays; Automerge carries live meme/tiddler content; `lares/` carries promoted canon.
- A public unceremonied canon-write surface. Remote/live edits may sync into room state only under the current authority model; canon promotion remains explicit.

<<~ ahu #room-model >>

## Room Model

**Core invariant: a room is a capability/filter/view scope over the shared memetic wiki corpus.**

The live corpus is a CRDT-backed tiddler document. Browser boot is local-first:

```
IndexedDB Automerge snapshot
  ↕ /meme-sync
NodeFS Automerge peer seeded from lares/
  ↕
LarariumCrdtSyncAdaptor
  ↕
room-scoped LarariumTW5 wiki
  ↙                         ↘
TW5 UX/filter/render          tldraw projection UX
```

Current implementation details:

| Layer | Current code | Authority role |
|---|---|---|
| Canon | `lares/` files | Promoted source; changed only by ceremony/editor/git/MCP trusted writes |
| Live corpus | One server Automerge doc, browser IndexedDB cache, `/meme-sync` | Shared room/tiddler content; local-first materialization |
| Semantic VM | One `LarariumTW5` instance per browser room scope | Filters, render previews, reaction binding extraction, sync adaptor |
| Canvas | Local `<Tldraw>` store populated by `projectFromTw5(tw5)` | Projection/edit lens; not the content authority |
| Legacy layout channel | `/rooms/:roomId` `TLSocketRoom` + SQLite in `serve.ts` | Compatibility/layout/reaction WS surface; not the primary browser content path |

The desired room-as-filter model still stands: a room recipe should run a TW5 filter expression, project only matching tiddlers into canvas shapes, and evict shapes that leave the filter. The code has the ingredients (`filterTiddlers`, `projectFromTw5`, `LarariumCrdtSyncAdaptor`) but the browser projection is currently a full initial projection with incremental update as M11 work.

**Room identity today:** `/room/:roomId` serves room-specific HTML meta tags and is the capability/view-routing seam. The meme content doc is still global per server process; per-room recipes and per-room Automerge docs are not yet split. `DEFAULT_ROOM = "main"` in `serve.ts`; the browser host currently uses a fixed TW5 scope id for the open session.

**Session identity today:** Automerge peer identity + UCAN handshake is the content-sync identity path. The old tldraw `?sessionId=` path applies only to the legacy `/rooms/:roomId` socket.

### Scale laws — room-as-view target

Prior art from YJS 3D spaces and TW5 large instances still informs the target, but the mapping changed after the local-first pivot:

| Problem | Prior art solution | Lararium mapping |
|---|---|---|
| Full corpus too large for canvas | YJS: sync nearby objects only | TW5 room recipe filters decide which tiddlers project into tldraw |
| Filter index vs body payload | TW5: small index, demand-load bodies | Automerge materializes tiddlers; TW5 filters/indexes; bodies can be projected lazily later |
| Camera-driven LOD | 3D engines: coarser geometry at distance | `applyZoomTemplate()` reads TW5 kumu layout tiddlers and updates shape props |
| Presence vs document sync | Awareness vs document CRDT | Automerge content state separated from tldraw session/presence/layout state |
| Eviction when leaving view | Frustum culling | Target: projection diff removes shapes no longer in the room filter |
| Write amplification | TW5 `changedTiddlers` selective refresh | `tiddlerStore.subscribe()` + `tw5.onWikiChange()` + future projection diffing |

**Target shape budget per room view:** ≤ 500 projected shapes at any time. Larger corpora should be navigated via TW5 recipes, portals, and zoom-level detail gates rather than by drawing the entire corpus.

<<~ ahu #seeding >>

## Boot Projection and Room Opening

Current M10 opening path is local-first and TW5-centered:

1. Server starts `Repo` with `NodeFSStorageAdapter` at `.lararium-data/meme-store/`.
2. If no Automerge meme-store doc exists, server builds `snapshotMemes` from `lares/` and seeds the doc with `{ title, fields, text }` records.
3. Server injects HTML meta tags: `lararium-meme-store`, `lararium-meme-sync`, `lararium-operator-did`, `lararium-receipt`, and route room id.
4. Browser opens `Repo` with `IndexedDBStorageAdapter` first, then connects to `/meme-sync` as a peer.
5. Browser creates a room-scoped `LarariumTW5`, runs `loadFromStore()` before `tw5-ready`, and starts `LarariumCrdtSyncAdaptor` both directions.
6. `LarariumShell` seeds local tldraw from `projectFromTw5(tw5)` by putting emitted page/shape/binding records into the editor store.

**Receipt delivery:** The receipt SHA now travels as `<meta name="lararium-receipt">` in the HTML shell. The hidden tldraw boot-receipt shape and `useBridgeReceiptFromEditor` pattern are deleted from the active path. `LarariumBootReceiptMeta` remains only as a deprecated compatibility type until the protocol surface is cleaned.

**Reseed semantics changed:** `/admin/reseed` still evicts the legacy tldraw SQLite room and recomputes snapshot/receipt, but normal corpus changes now flow through disk ↔ Automerge:

```
lares/ editor/git/MCP write
  → lares/ watcher
  → Automerge doc patch
  → browser Automerge sync
  → LarariumCrdtSyncAdaptor
  → TW5 change event
  → ReactionGraph / meme list update
  → future: projection diff into tldraw
```

`/admin/promote` writes `lares/` and patches Automerge immediately, so connected clients do not wait for a room reseed to see promoted text.

**Projection status:** `projectFromTw5()` performs a full TW5 → tldraw emission. Incremental `tw5.onWikiChange → project affected URI → editor.store.put/remove` is the M11 shape-refresh target.

**Shape ID scoping:** Shape IDs remain URI-stable (`memeFrameId(uri)`). `emitTldrawRecords(..., { pageOverride })` still exists as a library option for multi-page/multi-room emission, but the active browser path does not seed the canvas from a server boot snapshot.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #trust-tiers >>

## Trust Tiers and Access Control

Four tiers. Promotion is gated by **Orichalcum capabilities** (see `lar:///ha.ka.ba/api/v0.1/pono/orichalcum-capabilities`) — not web2 role assignment. The Orichalcum profile is UCAN-compatible at the wire boundary; Lararium-native caveats (`rating`, `manaoio`, `kapu-scope`, `epoch`) govern semantic authority beyond crypto validity. Stage band is a UX rendering annotation — it is NOT an Orichalcum gate condition.

| Tier | Identity | Canvas access | Room access | Orichalcum ability |
|------|----------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **anon** | Ephemeral session (no DID) | Lares chat rooms only | No boot room | `read` (public recipe only) |
| **user** | Self-sovereign DID | User-owned lararium rooms | No boot room | `read + propose` |
| **operator** | Promoted DID (delegated capability) | Full boot room (read + pending edits) | Yes | `read + sync + write + propose` |
| **admin** | Root DID (capability issuer) | Full boot room (read + canon promotion) | Yes | `promote + admin + revoke` |

**Orichalcum gate at room join:** Before `handleSocketConnect`, verify the presented Orichalcum capability (UCAN-shaped at wire) against the room's required ability and Lararium caveats. Reject with WS close code 4003 on failure.

```
ws://host/rooms/:roomId?sessionId=X&cap=<capability-proof>
```

Server principal is stable (Ed25519 keypair, generated once, stored in `.lararium-data/`). This is the Orichalcum audience for all room capabilities.

**Anon path:** No capability required for public lares chat rooms. Ephemeral signed nonce (short TTL) for rate limiting only.

**Single-user-multi-session:** Capability is scoped to the principal identity, not the session. Multiple tabs with the same identity share the same capability level automatically.

**Room WebSocket connections are NOT edge islands.** A room connection is session-scoped and ephemeral. An edge island is a named, capability-gated, durable-offset causal boundary between two Lares nodes — a different architectural layer (see `lar:///ha.ka.ba/api/v0.1/pono/federated-causal-islands`).

_Status: design only (trust tiers + Orichalcum gate). Authority seam (`LarariumAuthorityEnvelope`, `AuthorityFirstGuard`) shipped M9+. `PUT /admin/promote` local-operator path shipped M10._

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #canon-boundary >>

## Canon-Promotion Boundary

`lares/` is promoted canon. The browser/TW5/Automerge ring is live room state.

**Current two-layer model:**
- **Canon layer:** `lares/` carrier files, git-trackable, hostless `lar:///...` addresses.
- **Live room layer:** Automerge meme/tiddler records, materialized into TW5 and projected into tldraw. This layer may diverge locally/offline and sync later.

The old "confirmed SQLite vs pending tldraw" model is no longer the content authority model. SQLite/TLSocketRoom may still carry legacy layout state, but meme content promotion is governed by Automerge origins plus the explicit promote endpoint.

**Promotion path (shipped M10 — local-operator only):**
1. Operator calls `PUT /admin/promote` with `{ uri, carrierText, shapeId? }` (localhost-only today).
2. `canPromoteToCanon({ origin: "operator-import", authorityMode: "local-operator", target: uri })` executes as policy gate.
3. `resolveLarUri(uri)` resolves to `laresRelPath`; path-traversal guard ensures path stays within `LARES_ROOT`.
4. `writeFileSync(filePath, carrierText)` writes to `lares/`.
5. Server patches the Automerge meme-store doc immediately; the lares/ watcher remains the external disk→Automerge path and echo-loop guard seam.

**Target ceremony:**
- Canvas or TW5 detail editor triggers "promote" from selected/focused URI.
- Server validates proposed carrier text against parser/pranala schema before writing.
- Full Orichalcum/UCAN capability gate replaces localhost guard.
- Git/file backend commit metadata records operator identity.

**Policy invariant (`canPromoteToCanon`) — current active origins:**

| Origin kind | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| `canvas-draft` | ✗ blocked — requires explicit promote ceremony |
| `tw-local` | ✗ blocked — live TW5 edits cannot self-promote |
| `crdt-remote` | ✗ blocked — remote CRDT deltas cannot self-promote |
| `canon-hydrate` | ✓ allowed |
| `mcp-draft` | ✓ allowed (operator-trusted) |
| `operator-import` | ✓ allowed (operator-trusted) |
| `projection-cache` | retired — no longer a `ChangeOrigin` |

**Canvas write-back status:** `LarariumCanvas` contains a latent body-node text listener that writes `canvas-draft` changes to `AutomergeMemeStore`, but `projectToTldraw()` currently emits no `LarTLBodyNode` records. Therefore direct text editing on canvas is not functionally wired yet. TW5/detail-panel edits and promote ceremony are the near-term write path.

**What requires promotion:** new memes, new pranala edges, ahu structure changes, and carrier text changes that should become `lares/` canon.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #views >>

## Canvas Views — Single-Page Zoom-Gated Model

**Current implementation (M10 local-first path):** The browser owns a local tldraw editor store and seeds it from `projectFromTw5(tw5)`. View "modes" are zoom-level gates — shape props are batch-updated via `applyZoomTemplate()` on threshold crossings, not by switching pages. Five zoom levels correspond to TW5 kumu layout tiddlers (`lar:///kumu/meme-strategic` through `lar:///kumu/meme-action`), read at runtime via `getActiveTW5().getZoomLayout(level)`. The older `shape.meta.templateProps` / `KumuRegistry` stamping path is superseded for active zoom layout.

**Zoom-template routing (active) — Law of Fives axis 1:**

| Level | Threshold | Template | ahu visible | Ownership arrows | OODA-HA phase |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| strategic | < 0.15 | `meme-strategic` | ✗ (opacity 0) | ✗ | aftermath |
| operational | 0.15–0.35 | `meme-operational` | ✗ | ✗ | observe |
| tactical | 0.35–0.80 | `meme-tactical` | ✗ | ✗ | orient |
| combat | 0.80–1.50 | `meme-combat` | ✓ | ✓ (opacity 0.3) | decide |
| action | ≥ 1.50 | `meme-action` | ✓ | ✓ (opacity 0.3) | act |

**Rating and stage band rendering — Law of Fives axes 2 + 3:**

Rating (structural quality) and stage (authority level) are seeded per-meme at projection time and inform visual rendering independent of zoom:

| Rating | Border style | Opacity | Lock | Meaning |
|--------|-------------|---------|------|---------|
| Noise | dashed, dim | 0.35 | ✗ | raw signal; structural shape not yet achieved |
| Data | dashed | 0.55 | ✗ | structure visible; meme law not yet binding |
| Meme | solid | 0.85 | ✗ | lawful meme shape; baseline render tier |
| Ano | solid, accent | 1.0 | ✗ | implements outward type laws |
| Kapu | solid, accent, thick | 1.0 | ✓ | invariant kernel; immovable |

| Stage | Color temp | Label prefix | Arrow opacity | Meaning |
|-------|-----------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| GR | muted grey | (none) | 0 | ground — local, unratified |
| OS | dim | (none) | 0 | offstage — taking form |
| US | standard | (none) | 0.1 | upstage — in play, unreviewed |
| CS | standard | (none) | 0.2 | center-stage — operator-ratified |
| DS | vivid | ✦ | 0.3 | downstage — public, fully committed |

Rating and register/stage-like fields travel in shape metadata and are recomputed from TW5 tiddler fields during projection. Zoom layout props now come from TW5 kumu layout tiddlers rather than pre-stamped `shape.meta.templateProps`. The wikitext-filter cascade target remains: filters should be able to select by rating/register/stage atoms once the recipe layer is complete.

**Socket port shapes (active):** Each ahu slot emits a hidden `TLGeoShape` ellipse (8×8, `opacity:0`) as a stable arrow binding target. Pranala arrows bind permanently to socket shapes — not to ahu frames. `applyZoomTemplate` repositions sockets between two positions: `centerX/Y` (meme header zone, all zoom levels) and `spreadX/Y` (ahu frame center, combat/action only). Bindings never change; only socket position changes. This is the TW5-style selective refresh: the binding graph is stable, only rendering state moves.

**Ahu frame safety:** Ahu sub-frames are `isLocked:true` in projection emission to prevent tldraw from reparenting them when the operator drags a meme frame. At low zoom (meme frame shrunk to 60×28px), ahu frames at `y=108+` would escape parent bounds — the `opacity:0` hide prevents visual detachment and the lock prevents CRDT reparent.

Shape IDs are URI-stable (`memeFrameId(uri)` — no per-page prefix scoping). The `pageOverride` contract in `emitTldrawRecords` is retained for future multi-room projection but is not used by the active browser projection.

**Navigation:** `LarViewState` reducer (`ZOOM_IN`, `OPEN_GRAPH`, `CLOSE_GRAPH`, `NAVIGATE_BACK`, `GO_TO_ROOM`). `ZOOM_IN` drives `zoomToMeme()` camera animation. `GO_TO_ROOM` is currently a view/navigation action, not an active `useSync` WebSocket room switch in the browser path.

**⌘K command palette:** Implemented and active. Replaces `SidePanel` as primary room/meme navigation. Two sections: **Spaces** (DEFAULT_ROOMS with chronometer glyphs) and **Memes** (URI filter). Arrow-key navigation, Enter to activate, Escape to dismiss.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #hidden-skeleton >>

## Hidden Meme Skeleton — Ownership Graph as Render Target

Every meme frame owns its ahu sub-frames, and every ahu owns its socket port shapes. This ownership is a queryable graph fact independent of tldraw's `parentId` hierarchy.

**The problem `parentId` alone does not solve:** At low zoom, meme frames shrink to 60×28px. Ahu frames at `y=108+` are outside the parent bounds. tldraw's `parentId` keeps them structurally children, but their visual escape creates drag-reparenting risk and arrow binding instability.

**The skeleton model:** Each meme→ahu and meme→socket relationship is also encoded as a `control:owns` arrow in the projection snapshot — the "ownership skeleton." These arrows are:
- `isOwnership: true` — distinguished from pranala semantic arrows
- `opacity: 0` at strategic/operational/tactical; `opacity: 0.3` at combat/action
- `isLocked: true` — not draggable; structural, not cosmetic
- `meta.ownsMemeId` — points back to the parent meme shape for zoom toggling

**Why this matters for the widget tree:** The ownership skeleton is the tldraw-layer analogue of TW5's widget tree. When the render pass walks `WidgetNode[]` (Phase 3 target), it will use the ownership graph — not tldraw `parentId` — to find render targets. A template can ask "give me all ahu slots owned by meme X" by traversing `control:owns` arrows, not by inspecting shape hierarchy. This is queryable via `editor.getBindingsToShape()` and the MCP `lararium/edge/list` tool.

**Numbers (boot artifact, 2026-04-28):** 7 socket shapes, 14 ownership arrows (7 meme→ahu + 7 meme→socket), 6 pranala bindings (3 arrows × 2), 28 ownership bindings (14 arrows × 2). Total 56 shapes, 34 bindings.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #mcp-surface >>

## MCP Surface (Planned)

The Lararium node server will expose an MCP server alongside the HTTP/WS server. Claude connects to this MCP endpoint to read and act on the canvas without a browser.

**Planned MCP tools:**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `lararium/room/list` | List active rooms, seeding status, shape count, page count |
| `lararium/room/create` | Provision a new room from a BootReceipt or artifact name |
| `lararium/room/seed` | Force-reseed an existing room from current boot artifact |
| `lararium/meme/inspect` | Read a meme's tldraw shape record + lares carrier text by URI |
| `lararium/meme/list` | List memes in a room, filterable by TW5 filter expression |
| `lararium/meme/promote` | Write a canvas edit back to `lares/` (canon-promotion boundary) |
| `lararium/filter` | Run a `wikitext-filter` expression against the current boot closure (TW5 compat mode available via `x-tiddlywiki-filter` grammar key) |
| `lararium/edge/list` | List pranala edges for a given meme URI |
| `lararium/snapshot/export` | Export a room's current tldraw store as a snapshot JSON |

**MCP server placement:** Current MCP code lives in `packages/lararium-mcp` as a stdio adapter. It can call the node HTTP surface (for example `/admin/reseed`) when `LARARIUM_HTTP_URL` is configured, but it does not share a `TLSocketRoom` instance with browser clients in-process. Future MCP-over-HTTP can colocate with `packages/lararium-node`, but the active bridge is process/HTTP based.

**MCP transport:** stdio (for Claude Desktop / Claude Code direct integration) or HTTP SSE (for networked Claude access). Both transports should be supported; stdio is the default for local development.

**Trust model for MCP:** MCP connections are treated as operator-tier by default in local development (stdio = trusted). In networked mode, Orichalcum capability or API key authentication applies.

_Status: design only. Implementation follows room model stabilization._

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #deployment >>

## Deployment Topology

**Local development (current):**
```
browser → http://127.0.0.1:4321  (static app + WS rooms)
claude  → stdio MCP (planned)
```

**Production target:**
```
internet → nginx/caddy (TLS termination)
         → proxy_pass → lararium-node:4321 (loopback only)

claude   → HTTP SSE MCP endpoint (authenticated)
         → same lararium-node process
```

**Security invariants:**
- `lararium-node` binds `127.0.0.1` only in production. `0.0.0.0` is a dev-only override.
- Static file serving normalizes and boundary-checks paths against `APP_DIST` before serving.
- WebSocket URL injected into `index.html` is derived from the request `Host` header (not hardcoded `HOST:PORT`) so it works behind reverse proxies.
- `x-forwarded-proto` is respected for `ws:` vs `wss:` selection.

**Data directory:** `.lararium-data/` — contains the Automerge meme-store (`meme-store/`), the operator/server DID keypair, and any legacy per-room tldraw SQLite layout files. Not committed to git. Excluded via `.gitignore`.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #the-altar-fire >>

## The Altar Fire — Main Entry Room

`the-altar-fire` is the canonical entry room for all trust tiers. It is the hearth: operators, users, and anon visitors all land here first. What they see and can do is governed by their current trust-tier capability set.

```
lar:///ha.ka.ba/api/v0.1/lararium/the-altar-fire
```

This is an **invariant meme** (to be authored). It owns the room contract, portal registry, and trust-tier welcome surfaces.

**Trust-tier presentation at the altar fire:**

| Tier | What they see | What they can do |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| **anon** | Public memes only, read-only canvas, chat room surface | Browse, read, enter chat rooms |
| **user** | Own lararium rooms + shared public rooms | Read + create in own rooms, pending edits |
| **operator** | Full boot closure + promoted room list | Read + pending edits in boot room |
| **admin** | Full boot closure + invariant meme surfaces | Read + write + canon-promotion |

**The altar fire is not a blank lobby.** It renders the minimal boot closure — the 19 invariant memes — as the starting canvas, with portals to other rooms arranged around the perimeter. Think of it as a TiddlyWiki `DefaultTiddlers` list rendered spatially: the memes that are always open when you first arrive.

**Room portal arrangement:** Portals from the altar fire are positioned at canonical compass points or cluster zones on the canvas. Their placement is itself a meme (part of the altar fire carrier) — operators can edit portal position without canonical write-back.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #room-model-v2 >>

## Room Model — Extended

A **room** is a named capability/view scope over the live meme corpus. The legacy layout channel may back a room with `TLSocketRoom`, but current meme content is shared through the Automerge store and projected locally into tldraw. Rooms are organized under a namespace hierarchy that mirrors the `lar:` URI structure.

### Room naming

```
the-altar-fire                  — main entry (always)
boot                            — minimal 18-meme boot closure
full                            — full 58-meme closure
meme:${encoded-uri}             — single meme + direct neighbours + ahu sockets
synthetic-dream-machine/ftls    — RPG: Faster Than Light Starships book content
synthetic-dream-machine/wtf     — RPG: WTF Are We Playing book content
chat:${slug}                    — live session chat room (anon-accessible)
user:${did}                     — private user lararium
```

Room names are slugs. Room IDs are content-addressed (`sha:${receipt.sha.slice(0,16)}`) for boot/full rooms. Named rooms (chat, user, RPG content) use their slug directly — they are not seeded from the boot compiler.

### Wiki-recipes

A **wiki-recipe** is a room seeding specification: a named bundle of memes, carriers, and pranala edges that defines the initial canvas for a given room. Recipes are stored as lares/ carriers under `lares/recipes/${slug}.md`. The RPG rooms (`ftls`, `wtf`) will each have a recipe that imports all book-content memes once they are wrapped in memetic-wikitext and assigned `lar:` URIs.

### Portal shapes

A **portal** is a custom tldraw shape (`LarPortal`) that represents a navigable link to another room. Clicking a portal opens a WebSocket connection to the target room (in-tab navigation or new tab, user-selectable). Portals are part of the canvas state — they are room-level shapes, not lares/ canon, and do not require canon-promotion to be repositioned.

Portal shape record:
```ts
type LarPortalShape = {
  type: "lar-portal"
  props: {
    targetRoomId: string
    targetRoomName: string
    label: string
    trustTierRequired: TrustTier
  }
}
```

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #lar-uri-assignment >>

## Lar URI Assignment — Everything Gets a URI

All persistent content in Lararium receives a `lar:` URI. This is the foundational identity contract: if it exists and matters, it has an address.

**URI assignment by content type:**

| Content type | URI pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Invariant meme | `lar:///ha.ka.ba/api/v0.1/pono/${name}` | `lar:///ha.ka.ba/api/v0.1/lararium/the-altar-fire` |
| Wiki carrier | `lar:///${path}` | `lar:///AGENTS` |
| RPG book meme | `lar:///synthetic-dream-machine/ftls/${slug}` | `lar:///synthetic-dream-machine/ftls/jump-drive` |
| Imported text | `lar:///imported/${sha256-prefix}/${slug}` | `lar:///imported/3a9f/my-notes` |
| Imported image | `lar:///imported/images/${sha256}` | `lar:///imported/images/ba78…` |
| Live chat message | `lar://alias:tier@host/chat/${room}/${turn-id}` | `lar://joshu:operator@local/chat/the-altar-fire/turn-001` |
| Live session meme | `lar://alias:tier@host/${path}` | `lar://joshu:operator@local/sketch/idea-draft` |
| Committed user meme | `lar:///user/${did-fragment}/${slug}` | `lar:///user/did-key-abc123/my-meme` |

**Hostless URIs** (`lar:///...`) are canonical — they name things that exist in `lares/` or are promoted canon. **Hostful URIs** (`lar://alias:tier@host/...`) are live/session-scoped — they name things that exist only in the current session's branch/room until committed.

**Import flow:** When a user drops a text file or image onto the canvas, the server:
1. Computes `sha256(content)`
2. Assigns a hostful URI: `lar://alias:tier@host/imported/${sha256-prefix}/${slug}`
3. Creates a tldraw shape with that URI as its `sourceUri`
4. On commit: promotes to hostless `lar:///imported/...` and writes a carrier file

## TW5 — VerseGraph Core Binding

TW5 is summoned wherever the CRDT store lives. It is not optional and not a legacy dependency. Its role at each layer of the three-tree pipeline:

```
CRDT store (tldraw, YJS)
    ↓  AutomergeMemeStore intake (lar: title → tiddler)
AutomergeMemeStore / LarTiddlerStore
    ↓  LarariumCrdtSyncAdaptor (echo-loop guarded)
TW5 wiki (virtual server, isomorphic)
    ├─ filter engine   →  filterClosure(expr, closure)  →  FilterEngineFn in context
    ├─ parse bridge    →  text/x-memetic-wikitext parser delegates to parseMemeCarrier()
    ├─ kumuRegistry    →  computed view via tiddlerStore.subscribe() (reactive, incremental)
    └─ draft surface   →  canvas/TW5 edit → AutomergeMemeStore → promote ceremony → lares/
```

**Isomorphic law:** `LarariumTW5` boots on Node (server, MCP) and in the browser (browser host). The SyncAdaptor wiring is identical in both environments. You do not need to know which environment you're in to use TW5's filter or draft APIs.

**Draft → canon flow (full read/write):**

```
canvas edit (shape text field updated)
    ↓  shape.meta.carrierText updated in tldraw CRDT
    ↓  LarariumCanvas seedAll() → tiddlerStore.put(origin:"canvas-draft")
    ↓  SyncAdaptor → TW5 wiki tiddler updated (draft state)
    ↓  TW5 renderTree refresh (filter/widget re-evaluation)
    ↓  operator confirms: "Save as draft"
    ↓  tiddlerStore.put(origin:"canvas-draft") → Automerge room state (durable local-first draft)
    ↓  operator confirms: "Promote to canon"
    ↓  PUT /admin/promote → canPromoteToCanon() gate → lares/ file written → git commit
    ↓  server reseed → new room snapshot with hostless URI
```

**Canon-promotion assigns hostless URI:** A meme drafted on canvas has a hostful URI (`lar://alias:tier@host/...`). Promotion assigns `lar:///...` (hostless) and writes the carrier file. The tldraw shape's `meta.uri` is updated to the hostless URI after promotion — this is the only moment a shape URI changes.

**TW5 renderTree and canvas shapes:** TW5's render pipeline produces HTML for the MemeDetailPanel rich-view. It does NOT create tldraw shapes directly — shape creation is server-side via `compileCascade`. The browser reads shapes from the CRDT; TW5 provides the rendered view of their content. Future: a TW5 canvas widget type could emit shape layout hints back to the server via the promote/write-back path, but it is not the authoritative shape source.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #write-back-architecture >>

## Write-Back Architecture

**Current state:** Read-only for canon unless `PUT /admin/promote` is called. Live edits accumulate in Automerge room state. The direct tldraw body-node draft path is latent because body-node projection is not emitted yet; full draft→canon UX is the M11 target.

### The commit model — git-like confidence tiers

Canvas edits live in one of three tiers before reaching permanent storage:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LIVE SESSION (room state, tldraw pending layer)        │
│  Volatile. Lost on disconnect if not saved. Hostful.    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  BRANCH / ROOM COMMIT (Automerge room state, persisted) │
│  Durable across reconnects. Visible to all room peers.  │
│  Not yet canonical. Like a git branch commit.           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  DEEP SAVE / CANON PROMOTION (lares/ files, git-tracked)│
│  Immutable once committed. Hostless lar URI assigned.   │
│  Equivalent to a merge to main. Requires ceremony.      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This maps directly onto:
- tldraw's pending client state → live session
- Automerge room document → branch/live room commit
- `lares/` tree + git → deep save / canon

### Storage backend abstraction

Write-back targets an abstract `LarStorageBackend` interface so the same promotion path works for:
- **Files on disk** (`lares/` tree, git-tracked) — primary target
- **Database** (future: PostgreSQL for cloud-hosted instances)
- **IPFS / content-addressed store** (future: for DreamNet distribution)

```ts
interface LarStorageBackend {
  write(uri: string, content: string): Promise<void>
  delete(uri: string): Promise<void>
  list(prefix: string): Promise<string[]>
  commit(message: string, author: LarAuthority): Promise<string> // returns commit hash
}
```

The file backend wraps `fs.writeFileSync` + `git add` + `git commit`. The commit message carries the operator's `lar:` URI as author.

### Trust-tier write gates

| Action | anon | user | operator | admin |
|--------|------|------|----------|-------|
| Create shape in own room | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Edit pending shape in shared room | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Branch-commit (room-level save) | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Deep-save non-invariant meme | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| Deep-save invariant meme | — | — | — | ✓ |
| Canon-promote hostful → hostless URI | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| Assign `lar:///ha.ka.ba/api/v0.1/...` URI | — | — | — | ✓ |

### Ceremony surface

Canon promotion is always an explicit two-step:
1. Operator/admin triggers "Promote to canon" on a pending shape
2. Server validates shape against Lararium schema, assigns hostless URI, writes carrier file, triggers recompile

The tldraw canvas shows a visible distinction between pending (dashed border, amber) and confirmed (solid border, default) shapes. This is cosmetic enforcement of the canon-promotion-boundary invariant.

## Kinopio UX Model — Deep Research Findings

Kinopio (`kinopio.club`, Vue 3, open-source, not npm-publishable) is the closest public reference for the UX feel we want. Full source analysis at `github.com/kinopio-club/kinopio-client`.

### The Core Philosophy — Now Implemented

**The canvas is primary. UI wraps around it — never blocks it.**

Kinopio's `<Header>` is `position: fixed; pointer-events: none` with interaction re-enabled only on child buttons. The canvas fills 100% of the viewport. UI chrome exists at fixed viewport positions and *fades or repositions* during zoom.

**This model is now the Lararium implementation.** `LarariumShell` wraps `LarariumCanvas` via React portal: all chrome (`LarariumHeader`, `LarariumFooter`, `LarariumCommandPalette`) is `position:fixed`, rendered into `document.body` outside the tldraw DOM tree. The canvas fills 100vw × 100vh. `PageMenu`, `NavigationPanel`, `MainMenu`, `ZoomMenu`, `QuickActions`, `HelperButtons`, `MenuPanel` are all suppressed in wiki mode via `TLComponents = null`.

**Canvas mode toggle (`` ` `` key):** Dims Lararium chrome (`opacity: 0.35, pointer-events: none`) and restores tldraw's full toolbar/style panel for freeform drawing. Toggle pill always visible at bottom-left. This is the Lararium answer to Kinopio's mode distinction — not a separate tool, just a chrome visibility gate.

On iOS, Kinopio dynamically repositions its header via `updatePositionInVisualViewport()` every 60 frames to track the visual viewport during pinch-zoom. Android Chrome does NOT have this problem — `position:fixed` works correctly. Lararium targets Windows 11 + Android; no iOS visual viewport compensation needed.

### Layout Architecture (what lives where)

```
┌─ viewport (100vw × 100vh) ──────────────────────────────┐
│  ┌─ HEADER (position:fixed, top:0, pointer-events:none) ┐│

│                                                            │

│  ┌─ MINIMAP (position:fixed, bottom-right) ──────────────┐│
│  │  click-to-pan, drag-to-pan, viewport indicator        ││
│  └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘│
│                                                            │
│  ┌─ CONTEXTUAL PANELS (position:fixed, viewport-aligned) ┐│
│  │  appear on demand, auto-dismiss, never persistent      ││
│  │  • card detail (click meme frame → panel slides up)   ││
│  │  • room switcher (keyboard or header btn → drops down)││
│  │  • import dialog (drag file → contextual at drop pos) ││
│  └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘│
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What is NOT in the layout:** persistent side drawers, slide-in panels as primary navigation, floating bubbles over the canvas. Every panel is contextual and transient.

### Interaction Patterns to Implement

**Paint-select (lasso):** tldraw already has this. Expose it clearly — click-drag on empty canvas starts paint-select. Kinopio renders the lasso as an SVG overlay; tldraw handles this natively. No custom implementation needed — just ensure our component config doesn't suppress it.

**Drag-from-edge to create pranala:** tldraw's arrow tool creates connections by dragging from shape edges. We should wire this so dragging from a meme frame edge creates a `pranala` arrow with a default `family: relation` (upgradeable to `control`/`observe`/`dataflow` via a right-click context menu on the arrow). This is standard tldraw arrow binding — no custom shape needed for the arrow itself.

**Click empty canvas → create meme:** Click on empty canvas → drop a new pending meme frame at that position. Label = empty, URI = live-session hostful URI assigned immediately. Begin typing to set the label. This is the Kinopio card-creation flow. tldraw: programmatically create a frame shape on `editor.pointerDown` when target is the canvas (no existing shape under cursor).

**Double-click meme frame → detail panel:** Already wired (Vector 2 from previous loop). The detail panel slides up from the bottom of the viewport (not a full-height sidebar). Shows: URI, carrier text, ahu sockets, pranala edges in/out, commit tier, trust gate.

**Zoom = navigation:** No page-switching in the normal flow. Zooming out shows the graph overview at small scale. Zooming in past a threshold snaps the camera to the nearest meme frame and expands it (ahu socket sub-frames become visible). This is zoom-gated rendering: sub-frame geometry is only added to the DOM/store above a zoom threshold, not always present.

**Stick-to-cursor drag physics:** Kinopio's drag offset tracking (6–24px stretch-resistance based on card area) creates tactile feedback. tldraw handles drag natively, but we can augment: when dragging a meme frame, apply a subtle easing to `shape.x/y` updates rather than direct snap. Low priority but high feel.

### Space Model → Rooms

Kinopio has no canonical "home space." We do: **the-altar-fire** is the home room for everyone.

**User home spaces** are instanced rooms — each user gets `user:${did}` as their private lararium. The altar fire memes are **transcluded** into the user's home space: they appear as locked (read-only) shapes at a dedicated position on the canvas. This is not a separate page or tab — the transclusion renders the same invariant frames in the user's room, visually distinct (silver border, lock icon), non-moveable.

Transclusion implementation: when seeding a user room, the boot closure memes are projected as a locked cluster in a corner of the canvas. They reference their canonical lar URIs. When the user navigates to them (double-click), the detail panel shows the canonical carrier — but any edit creates a pending fork attached to the user's room, not the canonical meme.

**Room switching — implemented:** `⌘K` command palette is the primary room switcher. Viewport-fixed overlay, full-width at top, filter-as-you-type. **Spaces** section shows DEFAULT_ROOMS with chronometer glyphs (🗺️⚙️🔍⚔️⚡). **Memes** section filters by URI substring. Arrow keys navigate across both sections. Enter activates. Escape dismisses. This replaces the SidePanel story-river — SidePanel is removed.

### Portal Shapes

Portals are **`geo` shapes with custom `meta`** (`meta.larPortal = true`, `meta.targetRoomId`, `meta.label`) — not a custom `ShapeUtil`. Visual: built-in tldraw hexagon. Double-click fires `GO_TO_ROOM` dispatch via `doubleClickShape` handler in `LarariumCanvas`. Portal shapes are canvas-local state — moveable by operators without canonical write-back.

`LarPortalShapeUtil` is removed. Portal detection reads `shape.meta.larPortal` — no schema registration required, no tldraw upgrade risk.

The altar fire canvas seeds with portal shapes for all registered rooms at initial positions defined in `the-altar-fire.md`. Users can create their own portals by dragging a meme's URI onto the canvas and choosing "Create portal."

### What Kinopio Does Not Have (Lararium extensions)

| Missing from Kinopio | Lararium addition |
|---|---|
| Trust tiers | Header badge shows current tier; shapes have visual tier encoding |
| Content-addressed identity | Every shape has `meta.uri`; status bar shows URI on hover |
| Semantic edge types (pranala families) | Arrow color + context menu for family/role |
| Canon-promotion boundary | Commit-tier visual encoding (dashed=live, solid=branch, lock=canon) |
| Invariant memes (locked in user spaces) | Silver border + lock icon + read-only interaction |
| Command palette room switching | `⌘K` overlay |

<<~ ahu #platform-targets >>

## Platform Targets

| Platform | Primary input | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Windows 11 (native or WSL browser) | Mouse + keyboard | Primary dev environment |
| Ubuntu WSL (browser via WSLg or Windows Chrome) | Mouse + keyboard | Same rendering path as Windows 11 |
| Android Samsung (Galaxy phone / tablet) | Touch + optional S-Pen stylus | Responsive layout required; no hover states as primary affordance |

**Layout breakpoints:**
- Mobile (< 600px): header collapses to icon bar; footer hidden; minimap hidden; panels are full-screen overlays
- Tablet (600–1024px): header shows room name + ⌘K; panels slide in from bottom (60vh max-height)
- Desktop (> 1024px): full header + footer + minimap; panels contextual at 360px width

**Touch affordances:**
- All tap targets ≥ 44×44px (Android Material + Apple HIG minimum)
- Pinch-to-zoom is tldraw-native; we must not suppress it
- Long-press on empty canvas → create meme (equivalent to click-empty on desktop)
- Long-press on meme frame → context menu (equivalent to right-click on desktop)
- tldraw's paint-select is drag-from-empty — works on touch natively; ensure no canvas `onTouchStart` handlers interfere
- Android Chrome does NOT have the iOS visual viewport offset problem — no `updatePositionInVisualViewport` needed. Standard `position:fixed` works correctly on Android Chrome.

**WSL development note:** `serve.ts` binds `127.0.0.1` in dev. When running in WSL2, the WSL network adapter has a separate IP. Use `LARARIUM_HOST=0.0.0.0` to expose to Windows-side browser during dev. Do NOT commit `0.0.0.0` as the default.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #tldraw-template-model >>

## TLDraw Template Model — Use Built-ins, Not Custom Shapes

**Rule: do not roll custom shape utils when a tldraw built-in shape covers the use case.** Custom shapes (`ShapeUtil` subclasses) carry a maintenance tax: they must be registered with the store schema, their props must be versioned across migrations, and they break tldraw upgrades silently.

**Current shape mapping (what we already emit):**

| Lararium concept | tldraw shape type | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Meme container | `frame` (built-in) | Groups child shapes, named, has resize handles |
| Ahu socket sub-frame | `frame` nested in parent `frame` | Same type, different scale |
| Pranala edge | `arrow` (built-in) | Has binding to source/target, family stored in `meta.family` |
| Carrier text snippet | `note` (built-in) | Sticky-note look, auto-wrap text |
| Portal shape | **`geo` with custom `meta`** | Built-in rect/rounded-rect + click handler via `onDoubleClickShape` |
| Commit-tier indicator | `geo` dot shape | Small colored indicator overlaid on frame |

**Custom shape utils required (genuinely novel):**
- None currently. `LarPortalShapeUtil` was planned but a `geo` + meta approach is sufficient for MVP. Add a custom shape only when the built-in props model is demonstrably insufficient.

### TiddlyWiki Template / Layout Cascade — Current Correction (2026-04-29)

TW5's rendering pipeline remains the model: tiddler → cascade/filter → template/widget tree → DOM/projection. Operators should extend view behavior by authoring tiddlers, not by stamping one-off shape metadata.

**Active zoom layout path:**

Template/layout carriers are loaded into the room-scoped TW5 wiki as `lar:///kumu/meme-*` tiddlers. `applyZoomTemplate()` does not read `shape.meta.templateProps`; it calls `getActiveTW5().getZoomLayout(level)` and then batch-updates frames, socket ports, ownership arrows, and future body nodes.

```
Automerge tiddlers / lares carriers
       ↓ loadFromStore() + collectKumuDefs()
LarariumTW5 wiki tiddlers: lar:///kumu/meme-<level>
       ↓ getZoomLayout(level)
applyZoomTemplate(editor, level)
       ↓
editor.updateShapes(frame/socket/body-node props)
```

Each zoom layout tiddler may declare TOML keys such as `w`, `h`, `color`, `include-ahu`, and `show-carrier`. The older `KumuRegistry → buildTemplatePropsByLevel → shape.meta.templateProps` path is historical and should not be used as the active source of zoom truth.

**Rating and stage band rendering (Law of Fives):**

Two orthogonal axes inform visual rendering of each meme frame — distinct from zoom level:

| Axis | Values | Shape property affected |
|------|--------|------------------------|
| **Rating** (structural) | Noise → Data → Meme → Ano → Kapu | border style, opacity, lock state |
| **Stage** (authority) | GR → OS → US → CS → DS | color temperature, label prefix, ownership arrow opacity |

Rating encodes structural quality: a `Noise` carrier renders with a dashed border and low opacity — it has not achieved meme shape. A `Kapu` carrier renders with a solid accent border, locked, immovable. `Meme` is the baseline rendering target.

Stage encodes authority level: a `GR` meme renders muted/greyed (local, unratified). A `DS` meme renders with full color and full ownership arrow opacity. `CS` is the default visible rendering tier in the boot room.

These fields are projected into shape metadata or read from TW5 tiddler fields. Zoom-level props are read from TW5 layout tiddlers at runtime, not from `shape.meta.templateProps`.

**Epistemic fields on ClosureEntry (shipped 2026-04-28):** `confidence` (float scalar), `register` (operator confidence-register: C/SC/S/PS/P), `manaoio` (observability/interop score), `mana`, `manao` — all stored as tiddler fields in the wikitext-filter engine and queryable via `[toml:key[value]]` or `[field:key[value]]`. `stage` is a UX rendering annotation only — it is NOT a filter field.

**wikitext-filter dialect — operator parity table (as of 2026-04-28):**

| Operator | Status | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `all[memes]` | ✓ shipped | `[all[memes]]` → all ClosureEntry objects |
| `field:key[value]` | ✓ shipped | `[field:rating[meme]]` |
| `tag[uri]` | ✓ shipped | `[tag[lar:///ha.ka.ba/api/v0.1/pono/invariant]]` |
| `nsort[field]` | ✓ shipped | `[nsort[depth]]` |
| `limit[n]` | ✓ shipped | `[limit[5]]` |
| `prefix[str]` | ✓ shipped | `[prefix[lar:///ha.ka.ba/api/v0.1]]` |
| `toml:key[value]` | ✓ shipped | `[toml:register[CS]]` — translates → `field:key[value]` |
| `edge:FAMILY[ROLE]` | ✓ shipped | `[edge:control[owns]]` → `has[edge-out-control-owns]`; edges pre-loaded from `BootArtifact.pranalaEdges` |
| `edge:FAMILY[]` | ✓ shipped | `[edge:spatial[]]` → `has[edge-out-spatial]` (any role) |
| `self[]` | ○ future | requires rendering context URI injection |
| `ahu:id[X]` | ○ future | requires ahu index pre-loading |

**FilterEngineFn — isomorphic injection (shipped 2026-04-28):**

`FilterEngineFn` is the canonical async filter engine type, defined in `@lararium/core/tw-filter` and re-exported from `@lararium/core/cascade`. Signature: `(expr: string, closure: readonly ClosureEntry[], edges?: readonly EdgeRecord[]) => Promise<ClosureEntry[]>`. Package.json `browser` conditional + Vite alias ensure bundlers resolve to the correct runtime.

**`@lararium/core/cascade` — generic cascade engine (shipped 2026-04-28):**

`CascadeEntry<TOverride>`, `TemplateCascade<TOverride>`, `compileCascade`, `matchesEntry` are now core primitives — no tldraw coupling. Render-target adapters specialise `TOverride`:
- tldraw: `CascadeEntry extends CoreCascadeEntry<MemeTemplateProps>` (adds `levels?`)
- React: future — `CascadeEntry<KumuRenderProps>` (same compile path, different apply)

`compileCascade(cascade, closure, filterEngine, edges?)` parallelises filter evaluation via `Promise.all`. `matchesEntry` is exported so all apply passes share one match implementation.

**`edge:` operator — pranala edge pre-loading (shipped 2026-04-28):**

`BootArtifact.pranalaEdges` (typed `EdgeRecord[]`) flows through `compileCascade` → `filterEngine` → `filterMemesWikitext`. `buildEdgeFieldMap()` builds per-entry tiddler fields (`edge-out-FAMILY`, `edge-out-FAMILY-ROLE`). `toCanonicalWikitext()` translates `edge:FAMILY[ROLE]` → `has[edge-out-FAMILY-ROLE]` before TW5 sees the expression.

```typescript
// Query all memes with a control:owns outgoing edge
await filterMemesWikitext(closure, "[all[memes]edge:control[owns]]", artifact.pranalaEdges);

// Cascade: highlight memes that own others
const cascade = [{ filter: "[all[memes]edge:control[owns]]", override: { color: "violet" } }];
const compiled = await compileCascade(cascade, closure, filterEngine, artifact.pranalaEdges);
```

**Template namespace:** `lar:///ha.ka.ba/api/v0.1/lararium/templates/` — inside the stable tuple root, no adjacent namespace. `templates/index` owns control edges to all five carriers and is reachable from the `lararium` meme via `#hydrate-templates`.

**Parser addition:** `<<~ kumu name(params) >>` / `<<~/kumu >>` direct form added to `SIGIL_SCANS` alongside the `\\widget` alias. The `kumu` sigil is now parseable in canonical Hawaiian form.

**Phase 3 status correction (2026-04-29):** The three-tree target remains correct, but implementation is partial. Current code has the canonical parser and TW5 render bridge; `LarTLBodyNode` types and emission support exist, but `projectToTldraw()` still leaves `bodyNodes` empty. Therefore the tldraw structural skeleton and direct canvas body-node write-back are not shipped yet.

```

  ↓ parseMemeCarrier()                      @lararium/core
MemeAstNode[]                               parse tree — canonical

TW5 UX/detail panel         tldraw projection
(renderMeme/renderText)     (projectFromTw5 → frames/sockets/arrows today)
```

**tldraw adapter today** — meme frames, ahu/socket structures, ownership arrows, pranala arrows. `LarTLBodyNode` is reserved for the action-zoom body skeleton, but no body nodes are currently projected.

**React/TW5 adapter today** — `renderCarrierVDom()` and `renderMeme()` route carrier text through the TW5 widget pipeline for detail rendering and dispatch-node extraction. Kumu execution remains limited; full `KumuExecutor` lifecycle is M11.

**M11 target:** one parse/projection boundary should feed both the React/TW5 detail surface and the tldraw action-zoom body skeleton, after which the existing `canvas-draft` listener can become functional.

**Phase 4 (next):** Live Automerge/TW5 delta → projection diff into tldraw without full canvas rebuild. Carrier changes already reach TW5 through the adaptor; the missing piece is selective shape/body-node put/remove for affected URIs.

### Built-in tldraw UI Components to Reuse

tldraw exposes `components` prop on `<Tldraw>` to replace each piece of its default UI. We use this to inject our Kinopio-style chrome rather than rendering parallel DOM trees:

```tsx
<Tldraw
  store={store.store}
  components={{
    // Replace tldraw's default toolbar with our header
    // (we hide the toolbar entirely — all tools are keyboard-shortcut-only)
    Toolbar: null,
    // Replace style panel with our contextual panel
    StylePanel: null,
    // Keep tldraw's zoom controls but reposition them
    ZoomMenu: null,
    // Override top-left with our logo/room-name
    TopPanel: LarariumTopPanel,
    // Keep help/keyboard shortcuts
    HelpMenu: LarariumHelpMenu,
  }}
  overrides={larUiOverrides}
/>
```

By setting `Toolbar: null` and `StylePanel: null`, we remove tldraw's chrome from the render tree entirely. Our `<LarariumHeader>` and contextual panels take their place as fixed DOM siblings.

The `TopPanel` slot is a first-class tldraw component position — rendered inside tldraw's layout but as a React subtree we own. This is safer than absolute-positioning over tldraw's DOM.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #ux-shell >>

## UX Shell Architecture

The UX shell is the React layer that wraps the tldraw canvas. It owns:
- Fixed-position chrome (header, footer, minimap, contextual panels)
- Room state machine (active room, WS connection, reconnection)
- Trust-tier state (current user DID, tier, capability set)
- Command palette (room switcher, action palette)
- Drag-and-drop import handler (canvas-level, not tldraw-level)

**Stacking context law:** All Lararium chrome that competes with tldraw's panels MUST live inside tldraw's declared component slots. `position:fixed` DOM siblings outside tldraw create a separate stacking context that fights with tldraw's `.tlui-layout` (z-index 300). The correct model: one stacking context, tldraw owns it, Lararium fills the slots.

### Component Tree (target)

```
<LarariumShell>                          ← root, 100vw × 100vh, overflow:hidden

      ZoomMenu:     null,
      PageMenu:     null,
      TopPanel:     LarariumTopPanel,    ← room breadcrumb + nav — inside tldraw's layout
      SharePanel:   LarariumSharePanel,  ← ⌘K trigger — top-right tldraw-placed

    }}
    overrides={larUiOverrides}

**Slot rules:**
- `TopPanel` / `SharePanel` / `HelperButtons` render inside `.tlui-layout` → same stacking context as tldraw chrome → zero z-index conflict in any mode
- Wiki mode: `Toolbar: null` etc. suppresses tldraw's own widgets; our slots fill the space
- Canvas mode: tldraw's Toolbar/StylePanel restored alongside our slots — they coexist without fighting
- `position:fixed` is reserved for true overlays (command palette, detail panel) that intentionally cover all other UI

### Slot Contents

**`LarariumTopPanel`** (top-center):
```
[⬡ Lararium]  [room-name]  [breadcrumb ›  focus-uri]  ···  [← Back]  [⬡ Graph]
```

**`LarariumSharePanel`** (top-right):
```
[⌘K]  [theme-toggle]
```

**`LarariumHelperButtons`** (bottom-right):
```
[` Wiki/Canvas]  [zoom-glyph]
```

### Header Content

```
[⬡ Lararium]  [room-name ▾]  [room-breadcrumb]  ··· [share] [presence-avatars] [⌘K]
```

- **Logo + room name:** click room name → room switcher
- **Breadcrumb:** `the-altar-fire > user:did > my-space` for nested navigation
- **Presence avatars:** small circles, labeled on hover, positioned at their canvas location if visible
- **`⌘K`:** opens command palette

### Canvas Interaction Wiring (tldraw overrides)

tldraw exposes `<Tldraw overrides={...}>` for custom tools and UI. We use:

```ts
const overrides: TLUiOverrides = {
  tools(editor, tools) {
    return {
      ...tools,
      "lar-portal": larPortalTool,  // P key
    };
  },
  actions(editor, actions) {
    return {
      ...actions,
      "create-meme": createMemeAction,        // click empty canvas
      "promote-canon": promoteCanonAction,    // ⌘⏎ on selected meme
      "open-command-palette": {               // ⌘K
        id: "open-command-palette",
        label: "Open command palette",
        kbd: "$k",
        onSelect: () => dispatch({ type: "OPEN_COMMAND_PALETTE" }),
      },
    };
  },
  contextMenu(editor, schema, helpers) {
    // Add "Promote to canon", "Create portal", "Fork meme" to right-click menu
    return schema;
  },
};
```

### Zoom-level ontology and page-switching (current implementation)

The Lararium zoom ontology — five levels mapped to chronometer scale positions — drives both page auto-switching and future render gating. Implemented in `packages/lararium-tldraw/src/zoom-levels.ts`.

| Level | Glyph | Threshold | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| strategic | 🗺️ | < 0.15 | `meme-strategic` template: 60×28px dots, labels off |
| operational | ⚙️ | 0.15–0.35 | `meme-operational` template: compact frames, rating color |
| tactical | 🔍 | 0.35–0.80 | `meme-tactical` template: story river (default) |
| combat | ⚔️ | 0.80–1.50 | `meme-combat` template: ahu sub-frames, full label |
| action | ⚡ | ≥ 1.50 | `meme-action` template: carrier text inline |

`editor.store.listen(..., { scope: "session" })` watches camera/zoom state. Template switch fires only on level boundary crossings (hysteresis via `lastLevel` ref). `applyZoomTemplate()` calls `editor.updateShapes()` with props from `LarariumTW5.getZoomLayout(level)` plus hardcoded fallback defaults.

Footer glyph tracks zoom level live via `onZoomLevel` callback from `LarariumCanvas`.

### Offline / Reconnection Model

Mirror Kinopio's dual-load strategy:
1. On room open: restore IndexedDB snapshot immediately → render instantly
2. Simultaneously: connect WS → receive deltas → merge with local state
3. On disconnect: continue editing locally → queue mutations → replay on reconnect

This requires `@tldraw/store`'s persistence adapter wired to IndexedDB. Not yet implemented — see open questions.

## Theme System

tldraw exposes 70+ CSS custom properties under `.tl-theme__dark` / `.tl-theme__light` applied as classes on `.tl-container`. Lararium overrides them per-theme via a `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`.

### Activation

```css
/* tldraw applies .tl-theme__dark or .tl-theme__light to .tl-container */
/* We add overrides scoped to our data-theme so they win specificity */
html[data-theme="gruvbox-dark"]  .tl-theme__dark  { --tl-color-background: #282828; ... }
html[data-theme="gruvbox-light"] .tl-theme__light { --tl-color-background: #fbf1c7; ... }
```

tldraw's own dark/light toggle (`editor.user.updateUserPreferences({ colorScheme })`) stays as the master switch. Our theme selector calls it alongside setting `data-theme`.

### Theme Tokens — Gruvbox Dark

| tldraw token | Gruvbox dark value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--tl-color-background` | `#282828` | canvas bg |
| `--tl-color-panel` | `#3c3836` | toolbar / panel bg |
| `--tl-color-panel-contrast` | `#504945` | panel border |
| `--tl-color-text` | `#ebdbb2` | primary text |
| `--tl-color-text-1` | `#d5c4a1` | secondary text |
| `--tl-color-text-3` | `#a89984` | muted text |
| `--tl-color-primary` | `#83a598` | accent (aqua) |
| `--tl-color-selected` | `#fabd2f` | selection stroke (yellow) |
| `--tl-color-selection-stroke` | `#fabd2f` | |
| `--tl-color-grid` | `#504945` | canvas grid lines |
| `--tl-color-divider` | `#504945` | panel dividers |
| `--tl-color-low` | `#1d2021` | deepest bg |

### Theme Tokens — Gruvbox Light

| tldraw token | Gruvbox light value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--tl-color-background` | `#fbf1c7` | canvas bg |
| `--tl-color-panel` | `#f2e5bc` | panel bg |
| `--tl-color-panel-contrast` | `#d5c4a1` | panel border |

| `--tl-color-text-1` | `#504945` | secondary text |
| `--tl-color-text-3` | `#7c6f64` | muted text |
| `--tl-color-primary` | `#076678` | accent (blue) |
| `--tl-color-selected` | `#b57614` | selection (orange) |
| `--tl-color-selection-stroke` | `#b57614` | |
| `--tl-color-grid` | `#d5c4a1` | grid lines |
| `--tl-color-divider` | `#d5c4a1` | panel dividers |
| `--tl-color-low` | `#f9f5d7` | deepest bg |

### Theme Selector UX

Three options, cycled via sun/moon icon in `SharePanel`:
- `system` — follows OS `prefers-color-scheme`; tldraw `colorScheme: "system"`
- `gruvbox-dark` — warm dark; `colorScheme: "dark"` + `data-theme` overrides
- `gruvbox-light` — warm cream; `colorScheme: "light"` + `data-theme` overrides

State lives in `localStorage` (`lararium.theme`). Applied on mount before first render to avoid flash.

## Open Questions

**Resolved:**
- ✓ **Z-order / canvas mode chrome conflict:** All Lararium chrome moved into tldraw component slots (`MenuPanel`, `SharePanel`, `HelperButtons`). One stacking context, no z-index arithmetic. NavigationPanel (minimap+zoom) restored in both modes. See `#ux-shell`.
- ✓ **Theme system (shipped 2026-04-27):** `src/lararium-theme.css` overrides tldraw CSS custom properties scoped to `html[data-theme]`. `useTheme()` hook, `localStorage` persistence, flash-prevention inline script in `index.html`. Cycle button (`◑/🌑/☀`) in `SharePanel`. tldraw `colorScheme` synced via `useEffect` in `LarariumCanvas`. Default: `gruvbox-dark`. See `#theme-system`.
- ✓ **Meme list — CRDT-native (shipped 2026-04-27):** `editor.getCurrentPageShapes()` filtered to `meta.frameKind === "meme"` replaces `/api/memes` fetch. One-shot read on `synced-remote`. Reactive subscription (see open #2) still needed for live updates.
- ✓ the-altar-fire invariant meme: authored at `lares/ha-ka-ba/api/v0.1/pono/the-altar-fire.md`
- ✓ Double-click frame → ZOOM_IN dispatch: wired via `doubleClickShape` + `meta.uri`
- ✓ **UX shell refactor:** `LarariumShell` + `LarariumCtx` provider pattern. Slot components are stable module-level refs; all state via context. `SidePanel` removed. Footer merged into `MenuPanel` badge.
- ✓ **Command palette (`⌘K`):** Spaces + Memes sections, unified arrow-key nav, `` ` `` key toggles canvas mode.
- ✓ **Portal shapes:** `geo` + `meta.larPortal` pattern ships — no custom ShapeUtil. Double-click fires `GO_TO_ROOM`.
- ✓ **Canvas mode toggle:** `` ` `` key + `HelperButtons` pill. Same chrome landmarks in both modes; tldraw drawing chrome (Toolbar, StylePanel) added in canvas mode alongside Lararium slots.

**Open:**

1. ✓/⚠ **Zoom-gated rendering shipped; template source pivoted (2026-04-29 correction):** `applyZoomTemplate()` batch-updates frame/socket/body-node props on zoom threshold crossings. Active layout truth is TW5 `lar:///kumu/meme-*` tiddlers read via `getZoomLayout(level)`, with fallback defaults. Older `KumuRegistry` / `shape.meta.templateProps` stamping is historical. URI-stable shape IDs remain. See `#views` and `#tldraw-template-model`.

1a. **Async `ReactionGraph`:** `fire()` must return `Promise<void>` before `hui`/`heihei`/`puka`/`kukali` have execution semantics. Zero structural changes required — this is a method signature change in `live-protocol.ts`. Fanout modes (`Promise.all`, `Promise.race`, `Promise.any` + cancel) follow immediately after. See `#causal-islands`.

1b. **Wehe executor:** bind `SigilNode { sigilName:"kahea", attrs:{name,args} }` name-form calls against registered `wehe` definitions at render time. Closes TW5 template transclusion + Verse procedure call simultaneously. Depends on the TW5/kumu registry path, not the retired shape-meta template cache.

1c. ⚠ **kumu/widget-tree resolution pass (partial):** TW5 widget parsing/rendering is active for detail UX. The tldraw body-node structural skeleton is typed but not emitted (`projectToTldraw()` leaves `bodyNodes` empty). M11 should wire the single parse/projection boundary into `LarTLBodyNode[]`.

1d. ✓ **TW5 TemplateCascade type wired (shipped 2026-04-28):** `CascadeEntry { match: MemeCascadePredicate | fn, override: Partial<MemeTemplateProps>, levels? }` in `multi-view.ts`. `applyCascade()` evaluates per-meme at `renderAllViews` time — first match wins per zoom level. `MemeTemplateProps.cascade` string field (predicate stored in shape meta) maps to this runtime type. Future: thread wikitext-filter expression evaluation as `match` predicate.

1e. ✓ **Spatial family + FAMILY_ROLES (shipped 2026-04-28):** All 8 pranala families have canonical role vocabularies in `FAMILY_ROLES` (pranala-parser.ts). `validatePranaEdge` now emits `"unknown-role"` warnings for out-of-vocabulary roles across all `roleRecommended` families. Spatial roles: `contains | portal | adjacent | layer`. Unblocks portals-as-graph-edges (not just geo shapes with `meta.larPortal`).

2. ✓ **Meme count reactive subscription (shipped 2026-04-27):** `store.listen` with `scope: "document"` + 150ms debounce added to `LarariumCanvas`. One-shot scan on `synced-remote`, live re-scan on any shape mutation. `MenuPanel` now reflects live meme count.

3. **LarPortalShapeUtil (future):** Only needed if `geo` + meta proves insufficient for portal UX (click area, label rendering). Current `geo`+meta is MVP-sufficient.

5. **User home rooms (`user:${did}`) with altar-fire transclusion:** Seed logic for per-user rooms. Altar-fire memes projected as locked cluster in corner of user room canvas. Depends on UCAN/identity.

6. ⚠ **Room reseeding (`/admin/reseed`) — superseded semantics.** The endpoint still evicts the legacy tldraw SQLite room and recomputes receipt/snapshot state, but normal grammar/carrier hot reload now flows disk → Automerge → TW5. Use `/admin/reseed` for legacy layout reset or receipt refresh, not as the primary content update path.

7. **Content-addressed room keys:** `boot-${receipt.sha.slice(0,16)}` for boot/full rooms. Named rooms use stable slugs. Transition path from `"boot"` needs client redirect.

8. **Offline / IndexedDB persistence:** `@tldraw/store` persistence adapter for IndexedDB. Mirror Kinopio's dual-load: restore IndexedDB immediately, merge remote deltas after WS connect.

9. **Wiki-recipe carriers (M10):** `lares/recipes/` schema. RPG rooms (`ftls`, `wtf`) depend on this. Seeding path: `PUT /admin/promote` plumbing exists; recipe schema and per-room seed loop are the remaining deliverable.

10. ✓ **Write-back gate (`PUT /admin/promote`) — shipped M10 (local-operator).** `writeFileSync` + lares/ watcher reseed. Full `LarStorageBackend` (file backend + git) deferred until Orichalcum ceremony lands.

11. **Orichalcum capability implementation:** Principal identity (Ed25519 device key), Orichalcum capability type + caveat validator, UCAN-compatible wire proof. Server principal stable keypair. Room join gate. See `lar:///ha.ka.ba/api/v0.1/pono/orichalcum-capabilities`.

12. **ATProto identity (BFF):** See `lares/lararium-node/AUTH-ATPROTO.md`.

## Causal Islands — Async-First Execution Model

**Status: design locked (2026-04-28). Implementation follows async `ReactionGraph` pivot.**

### The model

Each `kumu` instance on the canvas is a **causal island** — an isolated async execution boundary. Events cross island boundaries only via declared `papalohe` edges (the reaction family in the pranala graph). No shared mutable state crosses island walls directly.

```
  island A (kumu: DoorTrigger)      island B (kumu: LightPanel)
  ┌────────────────────┐             ┌────────────────────┐
  │ @editable props    │             │ @editable props    │
  │ kau color = "red"  │             │ kau isOn = false   │
  │                    │──papalohe──▶│                    │
  │ fire OnActivated   │  reaction   │ handle OnActivated │
  └────────────────────┘  edge       └────────────────────┘
```

The `ReactionGraph` is the causal island manager. `fire(fromUri, trigger, payload)` returns `Promise<void>`. Handlers `await` within their island. The graph routes the async message; the islands execute concurrently.

### Why this matters for the canvas

The live corpus CRDT (Automerge) handles meme/tiddler synchronization. The tldraw editor currently renders a local projection of that corpus; the legacy `TLSocketRoom` may still handle layout/reaction socket experiments. Causal islands handle *event execution*. These are separate layers:

- Automerge/TW5 content state: which carrier text, fields, and bindings exist — CRDT semantics
- tldraw projection/layout state: where projected shapes appear and how zoom templates render them
- Causal islands: DoorTrigger fires → LightPanel activates → player gains 10 points — causal ordering required

The canvas shows both: shape positions are CRDT-merged; event wires (`papalohe` edges) and their execution state (active/inactive island indicators) are rendered as reaction arrows.

### Fanout modes (target)

| sigil | `ReactionGraph` mode | async semantics |
|-------|---------------------|-----------------|
| `hui` | `Promise.all(handlers)` | all islands complete before caller resumes |
| `heihei` | `Promise.race(handlers)` | first completion wins; others continue |
| `puka` | `Promise.any` + cancel signals | first wins; others receive cancel |
| `lele` | `void fire(...)` | fire-and-forget; caller does not await |

### `kukali` — wait posture

`kukali` (Hawaiian: to wait, to suspend) is the execution posture inside a causal island that yields until the island's input port fires. Isomorphic to `await someEventPromise()`. Registered in `BOOTSTRAP_SCANS` + `CANONICAL_SIGILS`; `\suspends` English alias. Emits `SigilNode { sigilName:"kukali", attrs:{ trigger? } }`. Semantics depend on `ReactionGraph.fire()` being async — correct dependency order (shipped 2026-04-28).

### TW5 / UEFN Verse child re-render research synthesis

**TW5 (push-on-change):** When the tiddler store mutates, the root widget's `refresh(changedTiddlers)` propagates down the entire widget tree. Each widget self-checks whether its dependencies appear in `changedTiddlers` — skips re-render if not. The `$list` widget patches single-item add/remove without full rebuild. Rapid changes are coalesced before DOM writes. No explicit subscription wiring required.

**Verse (pull-on-demand):** No automatic child cascade on state change. Developers call `SetText()` / widget methods explicitly in response to `subscribable` var mutations or game events. The UI tree is inert until code reaches into it. This is correct for the UEFN device layer — deterministic, developer-controlled, no hidden reactive overhead.

**Synthesis for Lararium:**

| Layer | Model | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| CRDT → canvas refresh | TW5 push | CRDT delta ≈ `changedTiddlers`; zoom threshold ≈ `widget.refresh()` |
| Kumu device layer (UEFN) | Verse pull | explicit `papalohe` wiring; `SetText()` analogue is `applyZoomTemplate` update |
| Widget tree resolution | TW5 selective | only widgets depending on changed memes re-resolve; others skip |

The socket port shape repositioning in `applyZoomTemplate` is the concrete implementation of TW5 selective refresh: the binding graph is stable (sockets don't change), only `x/y` position updates fire on threshold crossing. No shape rebuild, no binding change — pure property update on the dependency that actually changed.

### Relation to CRDT model

The UEFN operational model (file watcher → evict → reseed) is already live. Hot-reload works. The causal island layer sits *above* the CRDT room and *below* the canon-promotion boundary:

```
lares/ (canon)               — immutable truth
  ↓ compile + reseed
Automerge meme store       — live content/tiddler CRDT
  ↓ TW5 adaptor
LarariumTW5                 — filters, render bridge, reaction bindings
  ↓ projection / event wire
ReactionGraph (causal)       — async/local event routing between kumu islands
  ↓ render
tldraw shapes                — visual projection output
```

**Tier 3 note:** Cross-node federation edges (Tier 3) sit *above* lares/ in the authority hierarchy and *outside* the local Automerge/tldraw room machinery. They are not TLSocketRoom connections. They are named edge islands with their own lifecycle, governed by Orichalcum capabilities. See `#federation` and `lar:///ha.ka.ba/api/v0.1/pono/federated-causal-islands`.

<<~ ahu #meme-store-substrate >>

## Meme Store Substrate — Design Law

Research foundation: `lares/lararium-node/MEME-STORE-FOUNDATIONS.md`. Three laws derived from TW5 tiddler contract, UE5 World Partition schema enforcement, and AST self-hosting grammar.

### Law 1: `meme-immutability`

A meme object, once admitted to the confirmed layer (`lares/` hostless URIs), is never mutated. The only valid write is a full replacement producing a new URI. Session edits accumulate in the hostful tier (`lar://alias:tier@host/path`). Canon-promotion is the atomic transition.

**Refresh corollary:** after the local-first pivot, ordinary carrier refresh should be disk/Automerge/TW5 change propagation plus selective projection diffing. `/admin/reseed` is now a legacy layout reset / receipt recompute tool, not the primary content-refresh mechanism. Shape-level mutation outside the authorized store/projection path remains illegal.

### Law 2: `pranala-schema-binding`

Each pranala family (`control`, `relation`, `observe`, `dataflow`) declares an invariant property contract. Validation runs at parse time — a pranala that violates its contract is a `PranalaParseError` and never enters the boot closure. Schema definitions live as memes in `lares/grammars/pranala-families.md`; operators extend edge semantics by writing memes, not TypeScript.

UE5 analogy: "actor fails to instantiate if schema is violated" = "pranala emits parse error if family contract is broken."

### Law 3: `grammar-as-memes`

All sigil registry entries, parse rules, and template definitions SHALL live as carrier memes in `lares/grammars/`. The TypeScript parser is a thin rule-interpreter that reads grammar from the boot closure. Adding a new sigil requires authoring a meme, not modifying TypeScript source.

Phase progression: 1 (hard-coded TypeScript, complete) → 2 (grammar carrier + boot closure reader, complete) → 2.5 (GrammarRules threaded through parsePranalaEdges, complete 2026-04-27) → **2.x (grammar meme expanded to 40 sigils: TW5+Verse parity, English alias namespace, concurrency sigils `hui`/`heihei`/`puka`/`lele`, `wikitext-filter` dialect carrier, `kapu`/`pono` constraint distinction, complete 2026-04-27)** → 3 (self-hosting: parser is a meme, canvas can edit its own renderer, planned M8).

Grammar meme (`lares/grammars/memetic-wikitext.md`) now covers:
- All TW5 filter operators (via `wikitext-filter` dialect — forked, modernized, pranala+TOML aligned)
- All Verse/UEFN concurrency primitives (via 1:1 aliases `\sync`/`\race`/`\rush`/`\branch`)
- Full six-family pranala model with `pono` (constraint sugar) filling the last `sugar: pending` gap
- 18 English aliases erased to canonical Hawaiian at parse time — no semantic difference

### Convergence

```
meme-immutability      →  safe replacement without mutation
pranala-schema-binding →  type-safe graph at edge-creation time
grammar-as-memes       →  all system components live as memes
```

`lares/` IS the operating system. TypeScript packages are the kernel — thin, stable, fast. Memes are the userland — editable, extensible, self-describing. The tldraw canvas is the shell.

<<~ ahu #federation >>

## Federation — Tier 3 Design Law

**Status: design locked (Track D, 2026-04-28). Implementation deferred until after M9 + Orichalcum Phase 1.**

Cross-node pranala connections (Tier 3) are causal islands — not WebSockets, not room connections.
Full law: `lar:///ha.ka.ba/api/v0.1/pono/federated-causal-islands`
Capability model: `lar:///ha.ka.ba/api/v0.1/pono/orichalcum-capabilities`

### Three-tier architecture

```
Tier 1 — kumu instances (inside a carrier)
  causal islands provisioned when papalohe ports are declared
  events cross only via papalohe edges; kukali is the yield point

Tier 2 — memes inside rooms (inside a Lares node)
  rooms are filter recipes over the meme graph — not data partitions
  rating (≥Meme) gates which recipe includes a meme; stage band is a rendering annotation

Tier 3 — Lares nodes (federated)
  every federation edge IS a causal island
  carries: id, capability, offset, epoch, visibility gate, receipt
  authority reconciles before manifest; manifest before content
```

### Sync order (invariant)

```
1. authenticate peer
2. sync Orichalcum authority graph
3. derive visible room recipe + visible causal islands
4. sync collection manifest
5. sync each visible island: capability ops → CRDT heads → deltas → receipts
```

Content never precedes authority. Violating this order is federation corruption.

### Edge island lifecycle

```
stable sediment | current boot receipt | live delta tail
```

Join = receive boot receipt (snapshot of visible world at join time).
After join = request missing deltas from last known offset.
Revocation = epoch rolls; past sediment readable at prior keys; future tail denied.

### Visibility gate

```
rating(meme)  >= Meme            // structural: Noise→Data→Meme→Ano→Kapu
manaoio(meme) >= room.minManaoio // believability weight (default: 0.0 read / 0.60 propose / 0.80 promote)
recipe(room).matches(meme)
hasAbility(subject, "sync", edge.id)
!edge.revoked
!violatesKapu(meme, subject)
```

`rating` is the structural gate: has the carrier achieved lawful meme shape?
Noise and Data are node-local only. Stage band is a UX rendering annotation — room recipes
MAY include stage-based filter predicates as operator configuration, but stage is not
a hardcoded gate condition in the federation visibility predicate.

### Pull vs read (relay law)

`pull` = retrieve encrypted bytes and relay them (cannot decrypt).
`read` = decrypt and render semantic content.
A trust-minimized DreamNet relay holds `pull` only. It carries what it cannot read.

### Implementation path

```
Phase 0 — this section (law named) ✓
Phase 1 — OrichalcumCapability type + caveat validator + principal shape
Phase 2 — EdgeIslandState record + boot-join fixture
Phase 3 — delta frame type + offset-resumable stream prototype
Phase 4 — CRDT substrate decision (Automerge vs Loro per use case)
Phase 5 — long-lived actor runtime for edge islands
```
