## Three Converging Pressures

Three architectural forces pull on the Lararium stack simultaneously. This carrier holds the research synthesis and names the design law for each.

1. **Meme store + re-seeding** — what is the correct replacement contract for a CRDT-backed carrier store?
2. **Schema enforcement on pranala edges** — how does data-layer type binding prevent graph corruption?
3. **AST / self-hosting grammar** — how do system components (parser, schema, router, templates) themselves become memes?

These are not separate priorities. They converge at one point: **a meme is the atom of everything, and meme immutability is the load-bearing invariant that makes the rest possible.**

## 1. TW5 Tiddler Replacement Contract → Meme Immutability Law

TiddlyWiki 5 never mutates a tiddler in place. When content changes, the entire tiddler object is replaced in the store. This fires a widget refresh cascade: `ViewTemplate` walks a priority-ordered list of type-specific templates, picks the first match, and re-renders the affected widget subtree. The reactive cascade is triggered by identity change, not diff.

**Lararium translation:**

A `CarrierRecord` is immutable by construction (`Object.freeze` at compiler boundary, hostful URIs for session edits). Edits create a new hostful carrier at `lar://alias:tier@host/path`. Canon-promotion assigns a new hostless `lar:///` address and rebuilds the boot closure. The boot closure rebuild is the equivalent of TW5's full tiddler replacement — it fires the full reactive cascade: compiler → boot receipt → tldraw snapshot → CRDT merge.

**Law:** `meme-immutability`
> A meme object, once admitted to the confirmed layer, is never mutated. The only valid write is a full replacement producing a new URI. Pending edits accumulate in the hostful tier; they do not touch confirmed state. Canon-promotion is the atomic transition between tiers.

**Re-seeding corollary:** `/admin/reseed?roomId=boot` is valid only because it replaces the entire room snapshot — not individual shapes. Shape-level mutation outside CRDT merge is always illegal.

## 2. UE5 World Partition / UEFN Scene Graph → Pranala Schema Enforcement

Unreal Engine 5.6 World Partition enforces actor schemas at the data layer: each actor has a type-bound property schema; violation blocks instantiation. UEFN's Verse language extends this to runtime — static types prevent assignment of values that break the schema. Schema enforcement is not an afterthought on top of the data; it is the first gate before data enters the scene.

**Lararium translation:**

Pranala edges carry fixed properties: `family` (`control | relation | observe | dataflow`), `role`, `lifecycle`, `confidence`. The boot compiler's `dagViolations` check enforces a DAG invariant on `control` edges. But enforcement is currently post-hoc — parser runs first, violations are caught at compile time, not at edge-creation time.

**Target model:** Schema enforcement at edge creation, not compile time.

| UE5 concept | Lararium equivalent |
|---|---|
| Actor type schema | Pranala `family` + property set |
| Instance validation at spawn | Pranala parser validation at parse time |
| DAG topology enforcement | `dagViolations` in boot compiler |
| Level streaming boundary | Confirmed / hostful tier boundary |
| Verse static types | Pranala family-specific property contracts |

**Law:** `pranala-schema-binding`
> Each pranala family declares an invariant property contract. A pranala that violates its family contract is not admitted to the boot closure. The validator runs at parse time, not compile time. Schema definitions themselves live as memes in `lares/grammars/`, seeded in the boot closure, so operators can extend edge semantics without modifying TypeScript source.

**Fortnite / CRDT convergence:** World Partition's streaming boundary maps to Lararium's room boundary. Rooms stream in shapes (actors) on WebSocket connect; the room seed is the level. Re-seeding = level reload. The pranala DAG across rooms is the scene graph.

## 3. AST-Driven Self-Hosting Grammar

TW5's parser is modular and recursive. Parsing rules live as tiddlers tagged `$:/tags/Macro` — the parser is itself a wiki citizen, extensible without touching core code. The widget tree renders AST nodes; the template cascade picks the first matching template for each node type.

Lararium's memetic-wikitext kernel uses `<<~ ahu ... >>` (worksites), `<<~ pranala ... >>` (edges), and `<<~ loulou ... >>` (relation sugar) sigils. Currently the parser (`carrier.ts`, `pranala-parser.ts`) is hard-coded TypeScript. This is Phase 1. 

**Phase progression:**

| Phase | State | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — hard-coded | ✓ current | TypeScript regex + parser; grammar in source |
| 2 — grammar memes | next | Grammar rules extracted to `lares/grammars/memetic-wikitext.md` carrier; parser reads rules from boot closure |
| 3 — self-hosting | future | Parser and template cascade are themselves memes; system can edit its own renderer |

**Phase 2 architecture:**

A `lares/grammars/memetic-wikitext.md` carrier declares:
- Sigil registry (ahu, pranala, loulou, ...) as a TOML table
- Per-sigil parse rules as embedded code blocks (regex patterns + capture groups)
- Default template per sigil kind

The boot compiler reads this carrier during compilation. The TypeScript parser becomes a thin runtime that interprets grammar rules from the closure — not a hard-coded recogniser.

**AST shape (unified/remark analogy):**

```
MemeAST
  ├── DocTypeComment
  ├── IamBlock (TOML metadata)
  └── Body
        ├── AhuBlock { id, attrs, children: MemeAST[] }
        ├── PranalaEdge { target, family, role, lifecycle }
        ├── LoulouBlock { ... }
        └── Text
```

The tldraw projection layer (`lararium-tldraw`) already operates on a `LarProjectionRecord` union. Phase 2 feeds the AST into the projection — each `AhuBlock` becomes a frame, each `PranalaEdge` becomes an arrow, text nodes become notes. The template cascade (`selectLayout()`) already has the right shape.

**Law:** `grammar-as-memes`
> All grammar rules, parse patterns, and template definitions SHALL live as carrier memes in `lares/grammars/`. The TypeScript parser runtime is a thin interpreter; it MUST NOT hard-code sigil semantics. When a grammar meme changes and is promoted to canon, the parser is hot-reloaded without a TypeScript rebuild.

## 4. Synthesis — The Unified Foundation

The three laws converge:

```
meme-immutability     →  safe replacement without mutation
pranala-schema-binding →  type-safe graph at edge-creation time  
grammar-as-memes       →  all system components live as memes
```

These are not features. They are the substrate. Once all three hold:

- **Re-seeding** is safe: replace the full room snapshot, not individual shapes. No shape-level mutation outside CRDT. The room reload is a tiddler replacement — triggers full projection cascade.
- **Schema enforcement** is self-describing: pranala families are defined in lares/, readable by agents and humans. Operators extend the schema by writing memes, not TypeScript.
- **Self-hosting** becomes tractable: the parser reads its own grammar from the boot closure. Editing `lares/grammars/memetic-wikitext.md` changes parsing behavior after the next `/admin/reseed`.

**Convergence point:** `lares/` IS the operating system. The TypeScript packages are its kernel — thin, stable, fast. The memes are the userland — editable, extensible, self-describing. The tldraw canvas is the shell — the UI over the OS.

This is the Lararium architecture thesis. Everything else is implementation detail.

## 5. Build Order (next three pulls)

| Pull | Work | Unlocks |
|---|---|---|
| P8 | `/admin/reseed` endpoint — kill SQLite room + re-seed from `renderAllViews` on next connect | lares/ edit → live canvas loop |
| P9 | Pranala family property contracts + parse-time validator in `pranala-parser.ts` | schema enforcement law; blocks bad edges at source |
| P10 | Extract grammar rules to `lares/grammars/memetic-wikitext.md`; parser reads from boot closure | Phase 2 self-hosting; grammar becomes a meme |

P8 is the shortest path to the live edit loop. P9 hardens the graph. P10 begins self-hosting. Each is independently shippable.
