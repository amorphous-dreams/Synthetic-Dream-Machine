## Loop Position

Stance shapes the HOW layer of the grammar. It does not tell the reader what a claim says. It tells
the reader how to read the claim.

Stance receives:

- claim shape
- evaluative pressure
- live voice pressure
- confidence tags

Stance changes:

- undifferentiated evaluation into framed evaluation
- flat register reading into stance-specific meaning
- hidden spread into visible spread

Stance hands forward:

- an active evaluation frame
- amplitude pattern across the five stances
- audible fuzz when more than one frame carries weight

Stance should not:

- pretend one frame covers all claims
- flatten poetic, satiric, or private readings into proposition-only logic
- hide spread when multiple stances stay active

<!-- ahu lares:///grammar.stance.defines/stance/?confidence=CS:0.80#handoff -->

## Handoff

Stance hands directly into confidence interpretation.

The handoff should let a later reader answer:

1. Which stance leads this claim?
2. Which other stances still carry pressure?
3. What does the register measure within that frame?
4. How much spread should the reader assume?

If those answers stay unclear, confidence starts sounding universal when it only has local meaning.

## Composable Surface

| Stance | Sigil | Register Measures |
|---|---|---|
| Philosopher | `🏛️` | propositional truth-confidence |
| Poet | `🌊` | analogical resonance-confidence |
| Satirist | `🗡️` | targeting-confidence |
| Humorist | `🎭` | relational appropriateness |
| Private | `🔮` | nominal presence |

**Amplitude surface:** every rendered URI should show all five positions in canonical order. Elevated,
suppressed, baseline, or uncertain amplitude gives the reader the spread pattern without needing a
second notation system.

<!-- ahu lares:///grammar.stance.defines/stance/?confidence=CS:0.80#conventions -->

## Conventions

| Rule | Weight | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Read confidence within stance, not above stance | MUST | Syadasti carries the load here |
| Keep all five stance positions available in canonical order | MUST | Composable parsing depends on stable order |
| Let amplitude mark spread instead of adding a second fuzz channel | SHOULD | One visible system should do the work |
| Surface multi-stance pressure when it materially changes reading | MUST | Hidden spread distorts the claim |
| Keep stance tied to evaluation, not identity branding | SHOULD | Stance should read as frame, not costume |

**Syadasti rule:** register measures confidence within the active stance's evaluation frame, not
truth-weight universally.

<!-- ahu lares:///grammar.stance.defines/stance/?confidence=CS:0.80#procedures -->

## Procedures

1. Ask what kind of evaluation the claim actually needs.
2. Select the leading stance.
3. Mark any meaningful secondary stance pressure.
4. Carry the resulting amplitude pattern into the URI and HUD.
5. Read confidence through that frame.

**Failure mode:** using `🏛️` as a silent default for everything. That move erases the very distinction
the system built the stance layer to preserve.

<!-- ahu lares:///grammar.stance.defines/stance/?confidence=CS:0.80#reading-test -->

## Reading Test

A stance span passes when a future reader can recover all of this:

- the leading evaluation frame
- any meaningful secondary spread
- the meaning of the register inside that frame
- the reason that frame fits the claim

If the reader still has to guess what `0.65` means here, stance has not yet done its work.
