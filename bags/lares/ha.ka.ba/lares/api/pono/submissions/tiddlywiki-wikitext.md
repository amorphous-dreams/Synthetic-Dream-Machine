# TiddlyWiki 5 Wikitext — the base syntax

This document DESCRIBES an existing format: the wikitext dialect TiddlyWiki 5 parses, authored by
Jeremy Ruston and the TiddlyWiki community, defined today by its implementation. It claims no change
control — that belongs upstream — and it defines nothing the implementation does not already do. Its
office follows the `text/markdown` precedent [RFC7763]: a registration-grade description of a format a
community already writes, so that a structured-syntax suffix (`+tiddlywiki`, [RFC6839]) gains the
normative reference every registration template demands.

The format's grammar stands **open by design**: the parser composes its grammar at parse time from a
registry of rule modules, and plugins register further rules through the same mechanism the core rules
use. So this document enumerates the **default rule registry** and specifies the **registration
mechanism** and the **total-parse law** — it does not, and cannot, enumerate every grammar a wiki may
run, any more than [RFC7763] could enumerate every Markdown. No wikitext exists that fails to
parse.

<a id="/status"></a>

## Status

A draft, enumerated against the implementation: TiddlyWiki `5.5.0-prerelease` as declared by
`package.json`, at commit `69b98fc94` (upstream v5.4.1 lineage). Every file citation below reads
against that commit. The behavioral claims marked **measured** ran through the engine itself
(`node tiddlywiki.js` rendering probe inputs to HTML), and the files those behaviors live in carry no
local modification against the upstream merge base — the measurements describe upstream behavior.

The finished draft goes to the TiddlyWiki core maintainers for review before any registration cites
it — nothing here binds anyone until it has. The document travels upstream as a rendered projection of
this record; the record's own envelope belongs to its storage format, not to the description.

<a id="/the-load-bearing-property"></a>

## The load-bearing property — the total parse

One property of this syntax carries every dialect that rides it, and this document exists first to
state it precisely. It has three parts, each measured against the engine:

1. **The parse runs total.** No input fails to parse. Text that matches no active rule survives into the
  parse tree as text nodes; a block run that opens no block rule wraps as an ordinary paragraph
  (`wikiparser.js`, `parseBlock` / `pushTextWidget`). The parser defines processing for every input,
  conformant or otherwise — the posture the HTML specification takes for unknown elements [HTML].
1. **An unbound macro call lands harmless, and renders as nothing.** A call `<<name>>` whose name binds no
  definition parses cleanly into a transclusion node (`parseutils.js`); at render, the missing-target
  fallback of the transclusion widget emits no output (`transclude.js`, the `ts-missing` slot). The
  construct injures nothing around it — and it does **not** render as its own text. A dialect relying
  on visible passthrough of its added constructs relies on behavior the base does not provide.
1. **Storage round-trips verbatim.** Rendering never rewrites the source: a tiddler's `text` keeps
  every construct as written, bound or unbound, matched or unmatched. What a base parser cannot
  interpret it preserves at rest and omits or neutralizes at render — it never destroys.

Dialects that register additional parse rules ride the base as supersets BECAUSE of this law: a
receiver holding only the base parser processes a superset document without error, preserves it
without loss, and renders the base constructs it shares. The `+tiddlywiki` suffix earns its RFC 6839
place — generic processing of the underlying representation — on parts 1 and 3 together with part 2's
harmlessness.

<a id="/terminology"></a>

## Terminology

| term | reading |
|---|---|
| --- | --- |
| **tiddler** | the unit of storage and addressing: a titled record of named fields, one of which (`text`) carries content. |
| **field** | a named scalar on a tiddler; `title`, `text`, `type`, and `tags` carry conventional weight. |
| **wikitext** | the markup dialect this document describes, carried in a tiddler's `text` under `text/vnd.tiddlywiki`. |
| **rule** | one parser module recognising one construct; the parser composes its grammar from the rule set active for a parse. |
| **rule set** | the rules active for one parse: the default registry, as narrowed by configuration, `\rules`, or a caller. |
| **pragma** | a rule that runs in the prologue, before body content, shaping the parse that follows (`\define`, `\rules`, …). |
| **macro** | a named, parameterised text substitution invoked as `<<name args>>`. |
| **widget** | a runtime rendering node invoked as `<$name … />`; wikitext constructs compile into a widget tree. |
| **parse tree** | the array of typed nodes a parse produces; rendering consumes it, and the conformance suite compares against it. |
| **transclusion** | inclusion of one tiddler's content in another's rendering, `{{title}}` and its variants. |
| **filter** | the query sub-language (`[tag[x]sort[title]]`) that selects tiddlers; opaque to this grammar, defined by its own. |

<a id="/lexical-structure"></a>

## Lexical Structure

A parse runs in one of two modes. **Block mode** recognises constructs that open at the start of a
line and may span lines; **inline mode** recognises constructs within a line's run of text. A block
construct's interior generally re-enters inline mode. Ahead of both stands the **pragma prologue**:
pragma rules match only at the top of the text, each consuming its construct and the whitespace after
it, until the first non-pragma content ends the prologue.

The parser composes its grammar from **rules** — one module per construct, each declaring the modes it
serves. The `\rules` pragma narrows the active set for the remainder of a parse, which makes the rule
inventory below the dialect's true surface: a conforming description enumerates rules, never a fixed
grammar, because the grammar of any given parse follows from the rules active in it.

<a id="/extension-mechanism"></a>

## The Extension Mechanism — the rule-object contract

The grammar's openness comes by design, not by accident of implementation — it forms the format's
architecture, and this section states it normatively. **The core rules and every extension rule register through one
mechanism** — the inventory below enumerates the default registry, never the possible grammar.

A rule ships as a module of type `wikirule`. It exports exactly:

- `name` — the string `\rules` and per-wiki configuration filter by. One rule, one name.
- `types` — which of the three classes the rule serves: `pragma`, `block`, `inline`. A rule MAY serve
  more than one.
- `init(parser)` — bind to the parser instance; typically compiles the rule's match expression.
- `findNextMatch(startPos)` — the position of the rule's next match at or after `startPos`, or
  nothing.
- `parse()` — consume the matched construct and return an array of parse-tree nodes.

The parser assembles the active classes from the module registry at construction
(`wikiparser.js`, `createClassesFromModules("wikirule", …)`), so a plugin's rule and a core rule stand
as the same kind of object. Three narrowing surfaces then shape the set a given parse runs:

1. **Per-wiki configuration**: a rule whose configuration tiddler
  `$:/config/WikiParserRules/<class>/<name>` reads other than `enable` leaves the set
  (`wikiparser.js`, `setupRules`; skipped entirely in safe mode).
1. **The `\rules` pragma**: `\rules only <names>` keeps exactly the named rules; `\rules except
  <names>` drops them — by `name`, across all three classes, for the remainder of that parse
  (`wikiparser.js`, `amendRules`). An unrecognized keyword leaves the set unchanged, silently — the
  total-parse posture applied to the pragma itself.
1. **Caller injection**: an embedding application MAY hand a parse an explicit rule set, bypassing the
  registry.

**Precedence**: at each position the parser adopts the rule matching CLOSEST to the cursor; where two
rules match at the same position, the rule registered later wins (`wikiparser.js`, the match walk).
A description of an extension rule SHOULD state where it expects to stand relative to the core rules
whose surface it neighbours.

A dialect extends this format by registering additional rules and documenting them against this
contract, each visibly marked as an extension relative to the default registry — the posture GFM takes
against CommonMark [CMARK]. One such external dialect, memetic-wikitext, documents itself in a sibling
specification [MWT] under this contract.

<a id="/rule-inventory"></a>

## Rule Inventory — the default registry

Enumerated from the implementation (`core/modules/parsers/wikiparser/rules/`, commit `69b98fc94`):
44 distinct rule names — 8 pragma, 14 block, 25 inline, with `commentblock`, `html`, and `conditional`
each serving two classes. Names below carry the exact `name` exports — load-bearing, because `\rules`
and the configuration tiddlers filter by these strings.

### Pragma rules

| rule | construct |
|---|---|
| --- | --- |
| `macrodef` | `\define name(params) … \end` — macro definition. |
| `fnprocdef` | `\function` · `\procedure` · `\widget` definitions, `\end`-terminated. |
| `parameters` | `\parameters(…)` — formal parameters for a procedure body. |
| `import` | `\import <filter>` — pull definitions from the selected tiddlers. |
| `rules` | `\rules only | except <names>` — narrow the active rule set. |
| `parsermode` | `\parsermode block | inline` — set the mode the body parses in. |
| `commentblock` | `<!-- … -->` at prologue position; consumed, renders nothing. Also a block rule. |
| `whitespace` | `\whitespace trim | notrim` — whitespace handling directive. |

### Block rules

| rule | construct |
|---|---|
| --- | --- |
| `heading` | `!` to `!!!!!!` opening a line. |
| `list` | `*` `#` `;` `:` `>` runs — unordered, ordered, definition, quote lists; nesting by repetition. |
| `table` | ` | `-delimited rows with alignment, header/footer/caption markers. |
| `quoteblock` | `<<<` fenced block quotation. |
| `codeblock` | ``` fenced verbatim block with optional language. |
| `typedblock` | `$$$type … $$$` — a block parsed under another content type. |
| `styleblock` | `@@` fenced block carrying CSS classes/styles. |
| `horizrule` | `---` horizontal rule. |
| `macrocallblock` | `<<name args>>` standing alone as a block. |
| `transcludeblock` | `{{title | template}}` standing alone as a block. |
| `filteredtranscludeblock` | `{{{ filter }}}` standing alone as a block. |
| `commentblock` | `<!-- … -->` at block position. Also a pragma rule. |
| `html` | an HTML/widget element at block position (`<$widget>`, `<div>`, …). Also an inline rule. |
| `conditional` | `<% if … %> … <% endif %>` at block position. Also an inline rule. |

### Inline rules

| rule | construct |
|---|---|
| --- | --- |
| `bold` | `''bold''`. |
| `italic` | `//italic//`. |
| `underscore` | `__underscore__`. |
| `superscript` | `^^super^^`. |
| `subscript` | `,,sub,,`. |
| `strikethrough` | `~~strike~~`. |
| `codeinline` | `` `code` `` verbatim span. |
| `styleinline` | `@@…@@` styled span. |
| `wikilink` | a CamelCase bare link. |
| `wikilinkprefix` | `~Word` — suppress one CamelCase link. |
| `prettylink` | `[[text | target]]` link. |
| `extlink` | a bare external URL. |
| `prettyextlink` | `[ext[text | url]]` — the bracketed external-link form. |
| `image` | `[img[…]]` image embed. |
| `transcludeinline` · `filteredtranscludeinline` | `{{…}}` · `{{{…}}}` within a line. |
| `macrocallinline` | `<<name args>>` within a line. |
| `entity` | `&name;` / `&#nnnn;` character reference. |
| `dash` | `--` · `---` typographic dashes. |
| `hardlinebreaks` | `"""…"""` region where line breaks render literally. |
| `commentinline` | `<!-- … -->` within a line. |
| `syslink` | a bare `$:/…` system-title link. |
| `html` · `conditional` | the dual-class rules, at inline position. |
| `mvvdisplayinline` | a macro/variable/value display form. |

## The Degradation Rule

The total-parse law (#/the-load-bearing-property), stated as processor obligations:

**A parser MUST accept every input.** Surface matching no active rule MUST survive into the parse tree
as text; a block run opening no block rule MUST parse as an ordinary paragraph. Parsing MUST NOT fail,
and one construct's irregularity MUST NOT alter the parse of its neighbours. The fatal-error model
some grammars adopt has no place here — this format takes the graceful-recovery posture the HTML
design principles name [HTML].

**A parser MUST accept a macro call whose name binds no definition**, parsing it as a transclusion of
the named variable. At render, an unbound call yields no output and injures nothing around it. A
renderer MUST NOT treat an unbound name as an error, and MUST NOT rewrite the stored text — the call
survives at rest as written.

**Rendering MUST NOT alter storage.** The rendered projection of a tiddler and the tiddler's `text`
stand independent; a processor that rewrites source to match what it rendered destroys content the
next processor may understand.

<a id="/conformance"></a>

## Conformance

Conformance layers on the XML precedent of well-formed against valid, with the rule registry standing
where the document type declaration stands [XML]:

A **conforming document**: under the total-parse law every input parses, so document conformance
reduces to well-formedness of the constructs a document uses — closed fences, terminated definitions,
matched element tags. No input reads as invalid; a document only ever reads more or less well-formed.

A **core-conforming parser** accepts every construct in the default registry (#/rule-inventory),
honours the pragma prologue, and enforces the degradation rule (#/degradation). Because the parse runs
total, a core-conforming parser accepts every input — the class every embedding application can rely
on.

An **extension-aware parser** conforms relative to a **declared rule set**: the default registry plus
the extension rules it registers under the contract of #extension-mechanism, each documented and
marked as an extension. Two extension-aware parsers agree only to the extent their declared sets
agree — the interoperability posture RFC 7763 states for the Markdown family holds here unchanged.

Normative force in this document attaches to **parsing** — input to parse tree. Rendering behavior
enters the description only where load-bearing (the unbound-call fallback, the security gates) and otherwise left to
implementations.

<a id="/test-suite"></a>

## The Executable Conformance Suite

The implementation carries its own conformance corpus, and this description points at it rather than
duplicating it — the CommonMark posture, where the spec's examples double as its tests [CMARK]:
`editions/test/` holds the parser specs (`test-wikitext-parser.js` and siblings — input string to
expected parse tree, every node carrying its producing rule and source span) and some 274 tiddler
fixtures under `editions/test/data/`, runnable as `node tiddlywiki.js editions/test`. A parser
claiming core conformance SHOULD pass that suite for the constructs it implements.

<a id="/security"></a>

## Security Considerations

Wikitext reaches the browser DOM through the widget layer, and the implementation enforces three
gates, each measured (commit `69b98fc94`):

- **Unsafe-element renaming.** Element tags on the configured unsafe list (`script`, in
  `config.js`) render renamed — `<script>` becomes `<safe-script>` — so their content displays inert
  and never executes (`element.js`).
- **Event-attribute suppression.** Attributes whose names begin `on` (case-insensitive) never reach
  the DOM (`widget.js`, `assignAttributes` with event attributes excluded).
- **Tag-charset restriction.** Element tag names strip to `[0-9a-zA-Z-]` before use (`element.js`).

Unknown element names pass through as real DOM elements — the HTML unknown-element posture — styled
and displayed but carrying no behavior. **What the renderer does not gate**: URL scheme values on
attributes such as `href` pass unexamined (`link.js`, `widget.js` — measured as absence at this
commit), so `javascript:` and similar scheme hazards belong to the hosting context (CSP, sandboxing),
not to the wikitext layer. An embedding application MUST NOT treat the wikitext parser as a
sanitizer; the gates above bound script execution through markup, not every channel a hostile
document might use.

<a id="/media-type"></a>

## Media Type

TiddlyWiki names its wikitext `text/vnd.tiddlywiki` (`boot.js`, `registerFileType`, extension `.tid`).
That name stands in NO IANA registry (checked against the registry 2026-08-24): it reads as an
unregistered vendor-tree spelling, so any registration citing it starts from zero rather than from a
standing entry. The coordination — upstream files the `vnd.` registration with this description as its
specification reference, or chooses another vehicle — belongs to the TiddlyWiki core maintainers, with
whom the finished draft lands first. Under RFC 6838 §3.2 the registration properly belongs to the
producing organization; a third party may file, naming both parties, and the organization may assert
ownership at any time.

Because the grammar stands open, a registration MAY carry a `variant`-style parameter on the RFC 7763
model: a hint naming which rule-set family the author intended, obliging no receiver. Dialects that
register additional parse rules (memetic-wikitext [MWT] among them) would name themselves there
rather than minting sibling types.
