# Save-Path Invariants — IslandAdaptor Outbound

Path K / F-arc: outbound hygiene for sustained live wiki authoring.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~&#x0002;>>

<<~ ahu #problem >>

## Problem Space

`IslandAdaptor.saveTiddler` acts as the boundary where TW5 wiki edits cross
into the Automerge store. Without hygiene here, sustained editing produces:

- **Write amplification** — every keystroke fires a store write + CRDT patch +
  disk-projector file write. At 5 keystrokes/sec over a 10-minute session:
  3 000 store writes, 3 000 disk writes, all for the same tiddler.
- **Noisy projection state** — parse-warning tiddlers, `$:/state/*` fragments,
  and boot-splash signals accumulate in the wiki. Some carry `lar:` URIs and
  could bleed into the store without guards.
- **Draft routing confusion** — `"Draft of …"` tiddlers from TW5 editing UX
  should reach the per-wiki draft bag, not get silently dropped.

<<~ ahu #invariants >>

## Invariants

### SP-1 — Capture Debounce

`saveTiddler` MUST debounce per title. The debounce window: **400 ms**.

- While the timer runs, subsequent saves for the same title cancel the
  prior timer and restart it with the latest fields.
- The callback fires exactly once per debounce window — at flush time, not
  at call time. Callers MUST tolerate asynchronous callbacks.
- `stop()` MUST cancel all pending timers and drop pending callbacks without
  firing them.

Rationale: human keystroke rate typically runs 3–8 chars/sec. A 400 ms window
coalesces a full word or short phrase into a single store write. Stays below
perceived lag threshold (< 1 s).

### SP-2 — Ephemeral Truncation

Tiddlers at `lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/parse-warning/…` and
`lar:///ha.ka.ba/state/…` MUST NOT reach the Automerge store via `saveTiddler`.

These get written directly into TW5 via `wiki.addTiddler()` (not through
`saveTiddler`), so this invariant holds naturally. No explicit title guard
needed in the save path — document it here to prevent a future regression.

Auto-truncate sweep: a separate sweeper (outside this adaptor) MAY scan the
TW5 wiki on a low-frequency timer (≥ 30 s idle) and delete stale
parse-warning tiddlers. The adaptor owns the debounce; sweep lives in a
TW5 startup module.

### SP-3 — Draft Routing

`"Draft of …"` tiddlers from TW5 editing UX MUST route to `this.targetBag`
(the wiki's top draft bag) and MUST NOT be silently dropped.

Current state: the `isDraft` guard in `saveTiddler` silently drops drafts.
**Target:** remove the isDraft guard; let drafts write to `this.targetBag`
like any other live edit. The per-wiki draft bag at the top of the recipe
stack absorbs them naturally.

This change deferred until the wiki-init flow ensures `this.targetBag`
always carries a real per-wiki draft bag URI (not a placeholder). Until then,
the silent-drop behavior SHOULD remain to prevent drafts polluting the wrong bag.

### SP-4 — Ceremony Routing

If `fields["bag"]` carries an explicit bag URI, `saveTiddler` MUST use it
instead of `this.targetBag`. This is the promote-ceremony path.

Live TW5 edits without an explicit bag field route to `this.targetBag`.

### SP-5 — Single Parser Law

All inbound meme text passes through `splitBodyTiddler()` (ONE parser,
FOUR call sites law). `_writeMeme` upholds this; do not add a second parse
site.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #debounce-design >>

## Debounce Design

```
saveTiddler(tiddler, callback)
  → guards (echo, temp, system, draft-hold, meme-uri)
  → cancel pending timer for title
  → store { fields, callback } in _pending map
  → set new timer(400ms) → _flush(title)

_flush(title)
  → retrieve + delete from _pending
  → call _writeMeme(title, fields, origin)
  → fire callback on resolve/reject
```

State held on the adaptor:

| Field | Type | Lifecycle |
|---|---|---|
| `_debounce` | `Map<string, TimerHandle>` | per pending title; cleared on stop() |
| `_pending` | `Map<string, PendingWrite>` | tracks latest fields + callback per title |

`PendingWrite`:
```ts
{ fields: Record<string, string>; callback: SaveCallback; origin: ChangeOrigin }
```

On `stop()`: iterate `_debounce`, clearTimeout each, clear both maps.
No callbacks fire after `stop()`.
