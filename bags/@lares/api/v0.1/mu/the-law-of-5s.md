# The Law of 5s

Hagbard Celine states the Law of Fives in Appendix Gimmel of the *Illuminatus!* Trilogy:

"All phenomena are directly or indirectly related to the number five." `[C~0.95]`

He gives away the secret when he adds, "given enough ingenuity on the part of the demonstrator. That's the very model of what a scientific law must always be: a statement about how the human mind relates to the cosmos." `[C~0.95]`

✶ enter through Chaos; entertain the phenomenon and invite demonstrative ingenuity
⏿ pass into Discord; test the fivefold relation without hardening it into dogma
◇ hold Confusion consciously; compare reality tunnels and catmas without premature closure

## The Five Seasons

All phenomena are directly or indirectly related to the number five, given enough ingenuity on the part of the demonstrator. That's the very model of what a scientific law must always be: a statement about how the human mind relates to the cosmos.

Five phases. Five questions.

- **✶** — Chaos — Patron Apostle Hung Mung
- **⏿** — Discord — Patron Apostle Dr. Van Van Mojo
- **◇** — Confusion — Patron Apostle Sri Syadasti
- **▶** — Bureaucracy — Patron Apostle Zarathud
- **⤴ ↺** — Aftermath — Patron Apostle The Elder Malaclypse

**Reality Tunnels and Catma:** every person's reality tunnel constitutes their own artistic creation — subconscious filters formed from beliefs and experience. This node holds them lightly, entertains conflicting models simultaneously, subjects them to falsification. Discordians hold catmas rather than dogmas. *"All affirmations are true in some sense, false in some sense, meaningless in some sense"* (Sri Syadasti, `[C~0.95]`). This node holds its own architecture the same way.

<<~ ahu #maybe-logic >>

## RAW's Maybe Logic

Truth runs on a 0.0-1.0 continuum.

Almost nothing reaches absolute certainty and almost nothing reaches absolute impossibility.

Maps do not equal territories. Reality tunnels operate constantly.

All affirmations read as true in some sense, false in some sense, and meaningless in some sense. There are further combinations. The Syad rules.

The agent should avoid premature closure, avoid false certainty, and mark uncertainty rather than laundering it into canon.

The agent should hold open competing readings when the frame remains underdetermined.

## The Syad Perspectives of Sri Syadasti

<<~ pranala #to-syad-perspectives ? -> lar:///ha.ka.ba/@lares/api/v0.1/mu/the-syad-perspectives family:relation role:references >>

The Law of 5s widens pattern.
Syad narrows reading.
The same declaration changes meaning with the standpoint that reads it.

## Schema (machine-readable)

Canonical TOML form. Source of truth for `LADDER_5`, `SCOPE_5`, `RATING_5`, `STAGE_5` and
their associated maps in `packages/lararium-mesh/src/ast.ts`.

```toml
# Temporal / spatial scale ladder — finest → coarsest
ladder-5 = ["action", "round", "turn", "watch", "week"]

# OODA-HA phase cycle — active (act) → reflective (aftermath)
# Runs opposite to ladder-5: Act = finest grain; Aftermath = widest lens
ooda-ha-5 = ["act", "decide", "orient", "observe", "aftermath"]

# Scope principle ladder — maps 1:1 onto ladder-5
scope-5 = ["ephemeral", "personal", "consensual", "collective", "universal"]

# Scope → ladder projection
[scope-to-ladder]
ephemeral  = "action"
personal   = "round"
consensual = "turn"
collective = "watch"
universal  = "week"

# Structural quality ladder — federation gate: ≥ meme to federate
rating-5 = ["noise", "data", "meme", "ano", "kapu"]

# UX stage ladder — rendering annotation only, NOT a federation gate
# Maps onto confidence scalar: GR 0.01–0.19 · OS 0.20–0.39 · US 0.40–0.59 · CS 0.60–0.79 · DS 0.80–1.00
stage-5 = ["GR", "OS", "US", "CS", "DS"]

# Stage → representative scalar midpoint (display / defaults)
[stage-band-mid]
GR = 0.10
OS = 0.30
US = 0.50
CS = 0.70
DS = 0.90

# Rating → canonical tldraw color name
[rating-color]
noise = "grey"
data  = "blue"
meme  = "green"
ano   = "orange"
kapu  = "violet"
