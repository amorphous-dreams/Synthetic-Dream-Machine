# Lele

*lele* — Hawaiian: to fly, jump, leap; to move quickly; to pass over. Used in *lele kawa* (cliff
diving). The motion commits to the leap, starts a side flow, and continues forward without waiting.

A structured fire-and-continue sigil. Emits a message-family edge, starts the target flow, and
continues immediately. English alias: `\branch`.

Verse equivalent: `branch` — one or more async expressions start immediately and the enclosing
flow continues immediately. The side flow remains bounded by the enclosing async context and
cancels when that context completes.

Concurrency runtime pending (async-first sprint). Current tiddler registers grammar only.

## Law (Kānāwai)

A lele edge MUST carry a target URI as its first argument.
A lele edge MUST emit a message-family pranala and continue without blocking.
A lele edge MUST stay bounded by the enclosing async context.
A lele edge MUST cancel remaining side-flow work when the enclosing async context completes.
A lele edge MUST NOT wait for a response from the target.
