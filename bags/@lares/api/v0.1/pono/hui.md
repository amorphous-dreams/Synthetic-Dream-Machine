# Hui

*hui* — Hawaiian: group, club, association, organization; to gather together, to meet. A hui
brings separate parties into one meeting and holds them until the gathering completes. No member
leaves while others still travel.

An await-all synchronization sigil. The body of a hui block spawns parallel flows; the sigil
holds execution until every child flow completes. English alias: `\sync`.

Verse equivalent: `sync` — all branches inside the block run concurrently and the containing
flow resumes only after every branch settles.

Concurrency runtime pending (async-first sprint). Current tiddler registers grammar only.

<<~ ahu #law >>

## Law (Kānāwai)

A hui block MUST spawn all child flows before any awaiting begins.
A hui block MUST NOT resume the containing flow until every child flow completes.
A hui block MUST propagate failure from any child flow to the containing flow.
