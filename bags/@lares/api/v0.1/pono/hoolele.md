# Hoolele

*hoʻolele* — Hawaiian: to cause to fly, to launch, to send aloft; causative of
*lele* (to fly, leap). Where *lele* leaps and knows which tree it came from,
*hoʻolele* launches something that does not return. The kite released. The canoe
sent across open ocean with no anchor line back to shore.

An unstructured escape-hatch sigil. Launches a new independent task root —
a task that outlives the scope that created it and has no parent in the task tree.
English alias: `\spawn`.

Verse equivalent: `spawn` — the one unstructured concurrency operator. All other
operators (`sync`, `race`, `rush`, `branch`) create children within the current
task tree. `spawn` exits the tree entirely, creating a new root. It hides the
`<suspends>` effect from its caller — the formal mechanism of escape.

**Use `lele` (`\branch`) for side work that can be lost if the parent cancels.**
**Use `hoolele` (`\spawn`) only when the work MUST complete regardless of what
cancels around it.**

Concurrency runtime pending (async-first sprint). Current tiddler registers grammar only.

<<~ ahu #law >>

## Law (Kānāwai)

A hoolele call MUST target a single function with `<suspends>` effect.
A hoolele call MUST NOT target a function with `<decides>` (failable) effect.
  Wrap failable work in a `<suspends>` function that handles failure internally.
A hoolele task MUST outlive its creating scope — it is NOT cancelled when the
  creating scope exits.
A hoolele task MUST be explicitly cancelled via `task.Cancel()` when no longer needed.
  Callers MUST retain the returned `task` handle or use a timeout/race pattern.
A hoolele task MUST NOT be used where `lele` (`\branch`) is sufficient.
  Prefer `lele` for any work that can be abandoned if the parent scope cancels.
A hoolele edge MUST carry a target URI as its first argument.

<<~ ahu #when-to-use >>

## When to Use

`hoolele` is the escape hatch. Use it only for work that fits one of these cases:

**1. Persistence across scope destruction**
Work that must complete even if the UI, the widget, or the reaction handler
that started it is torn down. Example: a CRDT write that must flush to peers
even if the wiki VM is destroyed.

**2. Cross-island work**
Work that starts in one causal island and must complete in another, with no
shared cancellation scope. Example: a capability delegation request sent to
a remote peer.

**3. Background daemon tasks**
Work that runs indefinitely and should never be cancelled by normal flow.
Example: the CRDT sync loop, the WebSocket keep-alive, the Keyhive heartbeat.

**All other cases use `lele` (`\branch`).** The tree stays clean; cancellation
remains predictable; resource leaks are prevented.

## Six-Operator Concurrency Table

`hoolele` completes the Lararium concurrency ontology. All six Verse concurrency
operators now have pono counterparts:

| Pono | English | Verse | Graph op | Cancellation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `hui` | `\sync` | `sync` | join node — wait all | enclosing scope exit |
| `holo` | `\race` | `race` | prune node — recursive subtree cancel | first winner triggers |
| `puka` | `\rush` | `rush` | select node — first wins, losers continue | enclosing scope exit |
| `lele` | `\branch` | `branch` | child node — scoped fire-and-continue | enclosing function scope exit |
| **hoolele** | **\spawn** | **spawn** | **new root — exits tree** | **explicit Cancel() only** |

The five structured operators (`sync`, `race`, `rush`, `branch`, and the containing
concurrency blocks) all create children in the task tree. `hoolele`/`spawn` is the
one unstructured escape. It hides the `<suspends>` effect from its caller — this is
the formal mechanism that allows it to create a new root with no parent scope.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #syntax >>

## Syntax

```text
<<~ hoolele lar:///target/uri >>
<<~ \spawn lar:///target/uri >>
```

Returns a `task(t)` handle. The caller MUST retain it for later `Cancel()` or
`Await()`. Discarding the handle loses the ability to cancel or observe the task.

## Lararium-Specific Use Cases

In the Lararium stack, the irreducible TS infrastructure layer (CRDT, network,
Keyhive) represents work that MUST complete regardless of wiki VM lifecycle.
These are the natural `hoolele` boundaries:

- **`LarTiddlerStore` CRDT flush** — must complete even if the `MemeSyncAdaptor`
  is disposed; spawn the flush, hold the task handle in the store.
- **`VmPool` cross-VM coordination** — work that spans wiki VM instances has no
  single containing scope; spawn the coordination task at pool level.
- **Keyhive capability delegation** — async crypto; survives the UI context that
  initiated it.

The `MemeSyncAdaptor` boundary IS the `hoolele` boundary in the Lararium stack:
work above it (wiki reactions, widget handlers) uses structured concurrency;
work below it (CRDT, network) uses `hoolele`-style spawn semantics in TS.
