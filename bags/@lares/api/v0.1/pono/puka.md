# Puka

*puka* — Hawaiian: hole, opening, gap; doorway, exit. A puka marks where passage happens — the
first thing through the opening wins. The others keep moving; they simply no longer determine
the outcome.

A first-through-the-opening sigil. The body of a puka block spawns parallel flows; the first
flow to complete yields the result and the block continues — but the remaining flows run on in
the background without cancellation. English alias: `\rush`.

Verse equivalent: `rush` — parallel child flows race; first settler wins; losers continue running
in background. Distinct from `race` (which cancels losers immediately). See `holo` for the
cancelling-race form.

The puka metaphor holds: when a fish finds the gap in the net, it passes through. The net
remains open — the others may pass through later or not. The outcome already settled.

Concurrency runtime pending (async-first sprint). Current tiddler registers grammar only.

<<~ ahu #law >>

## Law (Kānāwai)

A puka block MUST spawn all child flows before any result lands.
A puka block MUST propagate the first completing flow's result as the block's output.
A puka block MUST NOT cancel remaining flows when the winner lands — they continue in background.
A puka block MUST cancel remaining flows when the enclosing async context (function scope) exits.
A puka block MUST NOT resume the containing flow until one child flow completes.
A puka block MUST NOT appear directly inside a `huli` (`\for`) iteration body.
