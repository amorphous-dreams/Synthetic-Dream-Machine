# Verse Task Tree

The Verse async execution model is a **forest of parent-child trees**, not an arbitrary
DAG. Each node in the tree is an async execution context (a suspended or running task).
Edges are parent-to-child lifetime containment edges. Cancellation tokens travel
**downward only**: parent → children, never upward or sideways.

`spawn` is the only way to exit the tree. All other concurrency expressions —
`sync`, `race`, `rush`, `branch` — create children that stay inside the current tree
and are bounded by their parent's lifetime.

## Tree Topology

```
root async context              ← any <suspends> function call is a tree node
├── branch child A              ← structured: bounded by parent lifetime
│   └── branch grandchild A1   ← structured: bounded by A's lifetime
├── branch child B
│   └── branch grandchild B1
└── [sync / race / rush         ← all remain inside the current tree]

spawn { ... }  →  NEW ROOT      ← exits the tree; new root in a new tree
```

The forest has multiple possible roots: every `spawn` call adds one.
Structured expressions never add roots — they only add children.

## Concurrency Operators as Graph Operations

| Pono | Verse | Graph operation | Cancellation rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hui` / `\sync` | `sync` | **join node** — fan-out then fan-in; containing flow resumes only when ALL children settle | children cancelled if enclosing scope exits before all settle |
| `holo` / `\race` | `race` | **prune node** — fan-out then prune; first winner; remaining subtrees cancelled **recursively** | winner lands → cancellation cascades to each losing arm AND all tasks those losers created |
| `puka` / `\rush` | `rush` | **select node** — fan-out then select; first winner; losers continue running in background | losers cancelled by **enclosing scope exit**, NOT by the rush winner itself |
| `lele` / `\branch` | `branch` | **child node** — parent continues immediately; child runs in background | auto-cancelled when execution leaves enclosing **function scope** (normal, fail, or upstream cancel) |
| TBD / `\spawn` | `spawn` | **new root** — exits current tree; no parent; outlives creating scope | NEVER auto-cancelled; requires explicit `task.Cancel()` or timeout pattern |

### `holo / race` — recursive subtree cancellation

When the first arm completes, the `race` expression sends cancellation signals to each
losing arm, and those signals cascade recursively to any tasks those losers created.
The entire subtree below each losing arm is pruned, not just the direct children.

### `puka / rush` — enclosing scope, not rush winner

When the first arm completes, `rush` does NOT cancel the other arms. They continue
consuming resources until: (a) they complete naturally, or (b) the enclosing scope
exits. At scope exit, all background tasks created by rush arms are cancelled by
normal cascading rules. The distinction from `race` is that the cancellation trigger
is the scope boundary, not the first winner.

**Law:** A `puka` or `lele` block MUST NOT appear directly inside a `huli` (`\for`)
iteration body. Placing branch/rush inside a loop accumulates unbounded background
tasks with no clear cancellation boundary.

<<~ ahu #task-type >>

## task(t) — Runtime Object

`task(t)` is a runtime object representing a currently-executing or suspended async
function. It is the handle returned by `spawn`. `branch` creates a task implicitly
but does NOT return a handle — the branch is managed by the enclosing scope.

### States

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Active** | Running or suspended; not yet finished |
| **Completed** (Uninterrupted) | Finished successfully; terminal |
| **Canceled** (Interrupted) | Cancelled before completion; terminal |
| **Settled** | Either Completed or Canceled; terminal |

### Methods

**`task.Await()<suspends> : t`** — Suspends the caller until the task settles.

- **Sticky:** If the task already completed, Await() returns immediately with the cached
  result. Multiple callers on the same task always receive the same result.
- **Cancellation propagation:** If the awaited task was cancelled, Await() propagates
  the cancellation to the caller.
- Can be called multiple times from multiple callers.

**`task.Cancel() : void`** — Requests cooperative cancellation.

- Cancellation is cooperative, not forced. The task does not stop immediately; it
  receives a cancellation signal checked at the **next suspension point**.
- Code between suspension points runs to completion before cancellation is observed.
- Safe to call multiple times or on an already-settled task (no effect).
- Responsive cancellation pattern: insert `Sleep(0.0)` in tight loops to yield and
  check cancellation each iteration.

### `cancelable` interface

```verse
cancelable := interface:
    Cancel():void
```

`task(t)` implements `cancelable`. The `cancelable` interface also appears as the
return type of `subscribable_event.Subscribe()` — these are unsubscribe handles,
not task handles. Same interface, different semantic role.

<<~ ahu #suspension-points >>

## Suspension Points

Suspension points are the only locations where: (a) async tasks can pause and yield
control, and (b) cancellation signals are checked and processed.

Suspension points include:
- Timing operations: `Sleep(duration)`, `NextTick()`
- Any `<suspends>` function call
- Structured concurrency expressions: `sync`, `race`, `rush`, `branch`
- `task.Await()`

Code between suspension points is **atomic** — it runs to completion without
interruption or context switching.

`GetSecondsSinceEpoch()` returns the same value within a single transaction (frozen
per-transaction). All calls within one atomic block share the same timestamp.

<<~ ahu #return-escape >>

## `return` Escape Semantics

A `return` statement inside a `sync`, `race`, or `rush` arm causes the enclosing
**function** to return — not just the arm. The entire concurrency expression is
abandoned:

- Arms already started execute their `defer` blocks during unwinding
- Unstarted arms are skipped entirely
- The enclosing function exits with the return value

This is a cross-cutting edge in the task tree: `return` pierces upward through
nested concurrency nodes and exits the containing function scope.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #defer-constraints >>

## `defer` Constraints in Concurrency

`defer` blocks execute during scope unwinding — whether from normal completion,
failure, or cancellation. They provide cleanup guarantees.

**Critical constraint:** `defer` blocks MUST NOT contain suspending operations
(`<suspends>` calls, `Sleep`, `Await`, etc.). This ensures cleanup happens
immediately without delay, even when triggered by cancellation.

**Exception:** `defer` blocks MAY use `spawn` to start async cleanup tasks. The
spawned task runs independently (new root) and completes after the deferred scope
has already exited.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #spawn-hides-suspends >>

## Why `spawn` Escapes the Tree — Formal Reason

Effects in Verse propagate upward through call chains. The `<suspends>` effect
propagates: any function calling a `<suspends>` function must itself be marked
`<suspends>`.

**`spawn` is the exception:** `spawn` **hides** the `<suspends>` effect from its
caller. The calling context sees no suspension; it does not need to be `<suspends>`
itself. The spawned function carries its own `<suspends>` effect independently.

This is the formal reason `spawn` creates a new root instead of a child node:
by hiding the effect, `spawn` breaks the upward-propagation chain that ties
structured concurrency expressions to their parent scope. The spawned task has
no parent effect context — therefore no parent scope boundary — therefore no
automatic cancellation.

**Constraint:** Spawned functions MUST have `<suspends>` effect and MUST NOT have
`<decides>` (failable) effect. To spawn failable work, wrap it in a `<suspends>`
function that handles failure internally.

## Visual Verse / UE6 — Current Status (May 2026)

Epic surveyed UEFN creators (2024-2025) on two proposed Visual Verse interface models:
- **Block-based** (Scratch/Google Blockly style) — nested blocks for structured code
- **Node-graph** (Blueprint-style) — data-flow and execution-flow nodes

**Status: unreleased, no confirmed architecture.** UE6 is "years away" (likely 2027+).

**Critical:** Any future Visual Verse node graph will represent **Verse execution
semantics** (this task tree model, structured concurrency, effects), NOT Blueprint's
event-driven graph. Blueprint nodes are event handlers and function calls in an
unstructured imperative graph. Visual Verse would represent Verse's structured,
effect-typed, concurrent expression tree — a fundamentally different ontology.

**Lararium implication:** Pono concurrency sigils (`lele`, `hui`, `holo`, `puka`)
are already aligned with Verse's structured execution model. When Visual Verse ships,
the sigil-to-Verse mapping in this document provides the canonical alignment surface.

## Verse Calculus vs. UEFN Verse

The Verse Calculus (VC) is a formal core calculus published at ICFP 2023 (Peyton Jones,
Sweeney et al.). It is a research artifact, not the game language.

Key distinctions:

| Aspect | Verse Calculus (VC) | UEFN Verse |
|---|---|---|
| Type system | **Untyped** (type system "subject of another paper") | Fully typed: `any`, `comparable`, `persistable`, etc. |
| Concurrency | Not present | `sync`, `race`, `rush`, `branch`, `spawn`, `task(t)` |
| Semantics | Small-step term rewriting (lambda calculus style) | Cooperative multitasking, suspension points |
| Status | Research artifact (ICFP 2023) | Shipping in UEFN |

VC's `choice` expression (`|`) — non-deterministic selection between two computation
branches — is the formal ancestor of `race`/`rush`. UEFN Verse gives this structured,
async-aware, deterministic semantics with the concurrency operators.
