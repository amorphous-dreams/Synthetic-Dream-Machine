# INSTRUCTION: For each todo item below, explicitly reference and apply the OODA-HA Loop for v3 → v4 Migration (Maybe-Logic Style) at the end of this file. Each migration step should document its Observe, Orient, Decide, Act, and Assess phases, and state confidence/uncertainty in E-Prime style. Avoid "is" and "has"; prefer "appears to", "seems to", "presents as", etc.


## v3 to v4 Memetic Sigils Migration TODO

This file appears to track items from memetic-sigils_v3.md that do not clearly present in memetic_sigils_v4_partial.md, or where the migration seems ambiguous or summary-only.


### Method
- Compare each section and table in v3 to v4.
- For each, mark as:
  - [ ] Not migrated (appears missing in v4)
  - [ ] Ambiguous/summary only (v4 seems to cover in summary, but details appear missing)
  - [ ] Clearly migrated (v4 appears to present all details, no apparent loss)
- Add notes for each ambiguous or missing item, stating confidence and uncertainty explicitly.

### Initial TODOs

#### 1. UCAN-Style Attenuation

- [ ] Ambiguous/summary only (v4 seems to cover in summary, but details appear missing)

OODA-HA Loop for UCAN-Style Attenuation Migration:

**Observe:**
v3 presents an explicit section with rules, code, and examples for attenuation, escalation, and inheritance. v4 appears to mention "UCAN attenuation" in Layer 3 and "Attenuation rule for nested memes," but the formal code and detailed logic seem less explicit. This appears as a summary rather than a full migration. Confidence: 0.85 that v4 omits some v3 detail.

**Orient:**
The v4 document seems to summarize attenuation logic, possibly assuming prior knowledge or deferring detail. Tension: v3's explicitness may serve implementers, while v4's summary may serve conceptual clarity. Open question: Does v4 intend to externalize detailed logic, or should it restore v3's explicit rules? Confidence: 0.7 that more detail would benefit migration clarity.

**Decide:**
Action: Propose restoring v3's explicit attenuation rules and code examples in v4, annotated in E-Prime and with confidence markers. Scope: Add a subsection to v4 Layer 3 or an appendix. Reversibility: This addition appears easily reversible if later deemed redundant. Confidence: 0.8 in this course of action.

**Act:**
Pending operator confirmation, prepare a draft migration of v3's attenuation logic into v4, using E-Prime and explicit confidence registration. Annotate any uncertainties or interpretive choices. Confidence: 0.75 that this will clarify the migration gap.

**Assess:**
Once added, review whether v4 now appears to serve both implementers and conceptual readers. Note any remaining ambiguity or new tensions. Carry forward any residue to the next Observe phase. Confidence: 0.7 that this will resolve the main gap, but open to further refinement.

## OODA-HA Loop for v3 → v4 Migration (Maybe-Logic Style)

### Observe
- Gather all v3 and v4 artifacts, notes, and migration gaps.
- Register ambiguities, missing details, and summary-only migrations.
- Note: “Truth” about migration status is always provisional; treat all findings as signal, not certainty.

### Orient
- Identify patterns in what’s missing or ambiguous (e.g., tables, logic, procedural clarity).
- Name tensions: Where does v4 summarize too much? Where does v3’s structure serve a purpose not yet ported?
- Float open questions: What does “full migration” mean in this context? What counts as “enough” detail?
- Avoid locking scope prematurely; keep the possibility of alternative migration strategies open.

### Decide
- For each gap, choose a concrete action: port, rewrite, clarify, or intentionally omit (with rationale).
- Define scope for each migration phase: e.g., “Restore v3 Table 2.1 in v4 Section 2, E-Prime style.”
- Make reversibility explicit: Can this migration step be undone or revised if new evidence appears?

### Act
- Implement the chosen migration actions in v4, using E-Prime and model-agnostic language.
- Annotate changes with confidence levels and rationale (“This appears to restore the missing logic at 0.8 confidence”).
- Document any blockers, deviations, or surprises encountered during the update.

### Assess
- Review the updated v4: Does it now serve the intended function? What residue or ambiguity remains?
- Carry forward unresolved questions or new gaps into the next Observe phase.
- Release what can be considered “done for now,” but keep the loop open for future refinement.

**Maybe-Logic Overlay:**
- At every phase, state uncertainty and confidence explicitly.
- Prefer “appears to function as,” “seems to hold,” “maps onto,” etc., over “is” or “fully migrated.”
- Hold all migration status as catma, not dogma: “This migration appears complete in some sense, incomplete in others.”

Update this file as you identify migration gaps or ambiguities.

The following summary appears to outline what from v3 does not clearly present in v4, or only seems to appear in summary/ambiguous form:

---

### 1. **UCAN-Style Attenuation**
- **v3:** Presents an explicit section with rules, code, and examples for attenuation, escalation, and inheritance.
- **v4:** Appears more briefly and less formally (see "UCAN attenuation" in Layer 3, and "Attenuation rule for nested memes"). The formal code and detailed logic seem less explicit.

---

### 2. **Glyph Set Categories (Section 5 in v3)**
- **v3:** Appears to provide a full table of 9 categories, with detailed sub-tables for each (Protocol, Auxiliary, Namespace, etc.), including codepoints, glyphs, and roles.
- **v4:** Categories seem present, but some details appear split or summarized. Category 4 (SCALE) now presents only subscripts, with die faces moved to Category 9 (SEMANTIC). Some category boundaries and roles seem to have shifted. The detailed sub-tables (e.g., for DIRECTION, RELATION, TECHNICAL, etc.) appear less granular in v4.

---

### 3. **Authority Matrix (Namespace glyphs)**
- **v3:** Presents an explicit table mapping glyphs to tier, render, evaluate, unask, and modify.
- **v4:** The authority matrix appears present, but the table seems less prominent and the semantics appear more summarized.

---

### 4. **Scale Mapping (FFZ Chronometer)**
- **v3:** Subscript numerals appear mapped to Chronometer slots, with explicit emoji/HUD mapping and discussion of slot positions.
- **v4:** Die faces (⚀–⚄) now appear as the canonical scale markers, with a new table and slot grammar. The subscript numerals seem less emphasized, and the emoji mapping appears less explicit.

---

### 5. **Detailed Category Tables (DIRECTION, RELATION, TECHNICAL, SEMANTIC)**
- **v3:** Each category appears to present a list of glyphs, codepoints, and semantic roles.
- **v4:** Some categories (e.g., DIRECTION, RELATION) seem present but with less exhaustive glyph lists and less commentary on each glyph's meaning.

---

### 6. **Parsing and Validation Logic**
- **v3:** Presents explicit parsing functions, validation rules, and strictness modes.
- **v4:** Parsing/validation is present, but the code and logic are more summarized and less step-by-step.

---

### 7. **W3C Compliance / Three-Layer Encoding**
- **v3:** Appears to provide an explicit section mapping storage, interchange, and display to the meme model.
- **v4:** This section does not clearly present in v4.

---

### 8. **HUD/Emoji/Record Symbol Layering**
- **v3:** Presents a discussion of HUD sigils, emoji, and record symbols as separate from glyph sets.
- **v4:** Some of this appears present, but the three-layer distinction seems less explicit.

---

### 9. **Miscellaneous Details**
- **v3:** Appears to provide more commentary on edge cases, e.g., "Clean separation: glyph set uses Categories 1-9. Chronometer record format uses its own symbol set. HUD rendering uses emoji."
- **v4:** Some of these distinctions seem present, but not always as explicit.

---

**Summary:**  
Most core concepts appear to have migrated, but v4 often seems to summarize or restructure details, especially in glyph category breakdowns, parsing/validation, and the explicit mapping of HUD/emoji/record symbol layers. Some formal logic/code and detailed tables from v3 only appear in summary or seem less explicit in v4.

The new todo file at  
[_todo/v3_to_v4_memetic_sigils_migration_todo.md](.v3_to_v4_memetic_sigils_migration_todo.md)  
appears to provide a way to track and resolve these migration gaps.
