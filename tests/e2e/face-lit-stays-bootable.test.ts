/**
 * A FACE LIT MUST LEAVE THE VESSEL BOOTABLE.
 *
 * ── THE LAW, VOWED BEFORE THE CAUSE WAS KNOWN ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Lighting a face is the operator act that lifts a place to a hearth. It mints a PersonaGroup, seeds four
 * planes, and writes the group's id into the bootstrap so the next boot reads a face standing. Every one of
 * those touches this island's own disk.
 *
 * So the vessel must still boot afterwards. That is the whole claim, and it does not depend on WHY a
 * particular vessel fails it — which is exactly why it stands written before the cause was found.
 *
 * ── WHAT BROKE IT IN THE MESH ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The docker harness's one hearth lit `alpha` and then died every boot with
 *
 *     [boot] hearth-private doc unavailable — local corruption (no peer carries it): @daemon (automerge:…)
 *
 * on the SAME document id each attempt, through three restarts. Its sibling herms hit the same wording as a
 * transient — a peer that had not stood yet — and recovered on retry. One message, two faults; a race
 * resolves on retry and a stable id failing thrice does not.
 *
 * ── WHY THE SEQUENCE HERE MATCHES THE CONTAINER'S EXACTLY ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `found` (place, faceless) → `persona new` PEERLESS → boot. The peerless mint is deliberate: seeding four
 * planes reaches only local disk, and reaching for peers that have not yet stood answers
 * `Document … is unavailable` — a resolution failure standing in for a dependency that was never real. If
 * lighting peerless leaves a state the peered boot cannot resolve, THAT is the fault, and this reproduces
 * it without docker, three containers, or a network.
