/**
 * e2e/promotion-publish-diff — the cap-gated promotion MOVE, witnessed as a
 * disk publish-diff (shore-law: working↔canon crosses only by an audited MOVE).
 *
 * Promotion is CARRIER-grain (operator ruling 2026-06-18): a MOVE of a carrier
 * root carries its whole group (root + #fragment + /path), so a meme publishes
 * entire and never orphans a fragment. Here the lares bag → the lararium bag (both already
 * disk-mirrored) stands in for the working→canon crossing.
 *
 * THE round-trip's three once-unbuilt pieces are now CLOSED, each witnessed:
 *   - V3 (the working disk mirror) — working-loop.test.ts
 *   - working CLI-reachability + ingest-back — wikis-ingest-back.test.ts (--in-wiki)
 *   - minted-@{slug} canon projection — minted-canon-projection.test.ts
 * This vector keeps its own focus: the MOVE gate + change-id + effect-record +
 * the disk publish-diff, with lares→lararium standing in for the crossing.
