/**
 * e2e/herm-floor — THE HERM CONTRACT, stood against a live vessel.
 *
 * A HERM IS NOT A LARARIUM MISSING SOMETHING. It is the BASE COURSE every vessel stands on, and a
 * lararium is that course with its hearth-fire lit. The stack carries the distinction as CAPS rather
 * than kinds: a vessel composes the caps it can hold, and `personaSlotCeiling("herm") === 0` bars a
 * SEATED persona root on a crossroads. Facelessness is not only a window between two commands — a
 * crossroads someone stands for the public may never light a face at all.
 *
 * MAY-HOLD-A-FACE ⊥ HOLDS-ONE-NOW. `standAs` asks the ARCHIVE question alone; whether a face STANDS is
 * a separate fact the boot reads separately, and `--recipe herm` DECLINES the lift rather than naming a
 * different kind of thing.
 *
 * WHY THESE ARE E2E AND NOT UNIT. A vector that fences a SITE finds that site; a vector that stands the
 * PATH lets the boot enumerate its own reaches for a face, and this floor was found one reach at a time
 * by unit vectors that each went green while the live boot failed further along. R1 stands the whole
 * path, and when it fails it fails with the next site's name in its message.
 *
 *   R1 — a herm reaches `live`                         · the base case of the stack
 *   R2 — a herm serves the public shelf                · carrying is what the floor is FOR
 *   R3 — a herm carries a crossing                     · admit-by-lease, the relay role that is load-bearing
 *   R4 — a herm refuses hearth-scoped acts LEGIBLY     · refusal is a feature of the floor
 *   R5 — a herm LIFTS into a lararium                  · the cap-stack transition the runbook's rite performs
