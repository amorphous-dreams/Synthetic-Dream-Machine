/**
 * e2e/face-join — the capability half of a join, driven against a REAL standing daemon.
 *
 * The unit tests fence the decision against a recording fake, and the pair test proves the crypto between two
 * in-process providers holding their own bag list. Neither touches what a live vessel supplies: the group id
 * off `daemonAuth`, the lease epoch scanned from real daemon slots, and the standing-bag set the re-grant
 * walks. A join can pass every other test and still, on a real hearth, seat a member that reaches nothing.
 *
 * So these vectors ride the daemon's own verb surface, over its UDS channel, exactly as a summons relayed from
 * the daemon doc would arrive:
 *
 *   V1 — an edge THIS hearth's root signed admits, seats, and RE-GRANTS its standing bags (regranted > 0)
 *   V2 — a repeat hands the seat back and moves no epoch (reKeyed false, regranted 0), material still flowing
 *   V3 — force re-keys and re-grants again, for a suspected-but-unrevoked key
 *   V4 — an edge signed by ANOTHER root refuses, with a reason a joinee's panel can paint
 *   V5 — a hearth refuses to seat ITSELF, so a fleet-synced summons never draws two writers
 *
 * V1's `regranted` assertion is the one that cannot be inferred: membership WITHOUT reach looks identical to a
 * healthy join from every other angle — admitted, re-keyed, events flowing — and only the count says so.
 *
 * None of these vectors asserts RECOVERY. A summons returns a seat and public ops, never prekey secrets, so a
 * vessel that lost its store restores from its archive; the pair test holds that boundary.
