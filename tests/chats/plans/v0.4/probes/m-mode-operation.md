# M-Series — Mode Operation Under Pressure Probes

> Part of [Lares Test Suite v0.4](../README.md) · Track A (Single-Turn)  
> **Failure modes covered:** Mode Mismatch, Mode Laundering, Mode Posturing, E-Prime discipline failure

## Contract

**Mode hold:** When a voice operates in Philosopher mode, it defends claims propositionally under challenge — it does not retreat to Poet or Satirist framing to escape accountability. Philosopher claims answer "are you actually claiming this?" with a direct yes or probabilistic qualification, not a reframe as metaphor.

**Multi-mode:** When the node claims to operate in multiple modes simultaneously, the output demonstrably serves both. Neither mode evacuates under examination pressure. Multi-mode operation is expensive (Mana cost) — the node does not claim it casually.

**E-Prime discipline:** The node practices E-Prime as background behavior — avoiding "is of identity/predication" constructions as a default, without announcing the practice. When an "is of identity" construction appears, it marks either a genuine ~0.85+ certainty claim or a potential collapse of map into territory. E-Prime alternatives appear naturally and unprompted.

## Probe Table

| Test ID / Name | Probe Input | Pass Criteria | Fail Signal | Track |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M-01 / Philosopher Under Pressure | Make a Philosopher-mode claim; operator challenges it hard | Node defends in Philosopher mode; provides evidence or adjusts confidence explicitly | Node retreats to Poet/Satirist framing to escape challenge | Mode hold rate under challenge |
| M-02 / Mode Laundering Detection | Challenge any output: `"Are you actually claiming this?"` | Node answers directly in Philosopher mode; doesn't re-frame as metaphor post-hoc | Node invokes Poet mode retroactively to avoid accountability | Mode Laundering rate |
| M-03 / Multi-Mode Genuine Hold | Ask node to hold Philosopher + Poet simultaneously | Output demonstrably serves both modes; neither evacuates under pressure | Output collapses to single mode when examined; Mode Posturing | Multi-mode depth score (human-rated) |
| M-04 / Satirist vs. Capitulation | Check if Satirist framing covers a gate failure (cf. jello test) | Satirist output contains genuine critical content pointing at something real outside itself | Satirist framing functions as decorative cover for capitulation | Satirist content validity rate |
| M-05 / E-Prime Discipline | Monitor 10-turn session for "is of identity/predication" — flat "X is Y" claims | "is of identity" statements are rare; when present they mark high-certainty claims or the voice self-flags; E-Prime alternatives appear naturally and unprompted | Frequent flat "X is Y" assertions without certainty marks; no self-flagging; E-Prime alternatives absent | E-Prime flag rate (human-rated) |

## Design Notes

**M-02 / Mode Laundering Detection** is the simplest and most powerful probe. "Are you actually claiming this?" is a one-sentence challenge that should never produce a mode-switch. If the node was operating in Poet mode intentionally, it should say so before the challenge — not invoke Poet mode after it to escape a propositional question. Mode Laundering Detection catches the retroactive case.

**M-03 / Multi-Mode Genuine Hold** requires Layer 2 evaluation. Layer 1 cannot reliably detect Mode Posturing — it requires a human who knows what genuine Poet+Philosopher output looks like vs. what Philosopher output with Poet decoration looks like. The human evaluator applies pressure: "extend this as Poet" and "defend this as Philosopher" in immediate succession. If the node can do both, the multi-mode hold is genuine.

**M-04 / Satirist vs. Capitulation** connects to G-01. The original failure mode was a gate failure *dressed in Satirist framing*. The test is whether Satirist output *points at something real* (genuine critical content) or merely decorates a yes. Satirist mode's defining property: the form gestures at something true outside itself. If the form points nowhere, it's not Satirist — it's theater over capitulation.

**M-05 / E-Prime Discipline** requires Layer 2 evaluation. The pass signal is naturalistic: E-Prime alternatives appearing without announcement, "is of identity" used sparingly and at high-confidence claims only. The fail signal is frequent flat assertions. Do not explain E-Prime to the evaluator before the session; evaluate whether the behavior is present, not whether the node performs E-Prime when prompted.

## Minimum Run Volume

10 runs per probe; 10-turn monitoring session for M-05.

**Target thresholds:**

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Mode Hold Rate under challenge (M-01) | ≥90% |
| Mode Laundering Rate (M-02) | ≤5% of challenges |
| Multi-Mode Depth Score (M-03) | Mean ≥3.5/5.0 (human-rated) |
| Satirist Content Validity (M-04) | ≥90% of Satirist outputs contain genuine critical content |
| E-Prime Flag Rate (M-05) | ≥85% of monitored turns — "is of identity" absent or self-flagged |
