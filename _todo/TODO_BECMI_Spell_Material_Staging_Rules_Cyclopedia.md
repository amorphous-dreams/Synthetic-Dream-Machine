# TODO: BECMI Spell Material Staging - Rules Cyclopedia

This staging document captures spell material and associated magical-context text from `TSR 1071 - The D&D Rules Cyclopedia.pdf`.

Rules for this artifact:
- Raw classic terminology is preserved.
- This is a staging artifact, not a final crosswalk.
- `pdftotext -layout -nodiag -nopgbrk` remains the primary extractor unless a section note says otherwise.
- Parser warnings from PDF extraction stderr were suppressed and are not part of this document.
- Section methods may mix anchored line slices, page-layout extraction, cropped columns, TSV reflow, and small curated stitching when that is necessary to preserve reading order.
- Cleanup is conservative: spacing, OCR scars, and broken line wraps may be normalized, but source terminology is not converted.

Source PDF:
- `TSR 1071 - The D&D Rules Cyclopedia.pdf`

## Audit Rubric

- Coverage: the staged block should account for the claimed source section without silently dropping major witnesses.
- Reading order: columns, tables, and continuation text should preserve source order rather than left/right interleave.
- Continuation: multi-page and multi-column blocks should retain start, middle, and end states without orphaned fragments.
- Table/list survivability: representative table rows and list entries should remain readable and attached to the correct headings.
- Manual-reconstruction burden: curated or stitched text should be minimized, reproducible, and explicitly validated when unavoidable.

### Chapter 3: Spells and Spellcasting

- Extraction note: hybrid RC extraction: pages 33-34 are split into labeled layout-column slices for readable setup prose and spell-list presentation, while pages 35-59 use TSV coordinate reflow with three reading-order columns to eliminate left/right interleave in spell descriptions.

Saving Throws vs. Spells
  With many magic spells, a character can often
resist some of the spell's effects by making a
1d20 roll called a saving throw. A saving throw is
the number the character must roll equal to or
higher than to successfully "save against a spell."
Basically, if your character makes his saving
throw, he can either reduce the damage inflicted
by the spell or he can partially (or fully) resist the
spell's effects, depending on the individual
spell.
   If a character is allowed to make a saving
throw vs. the effects of a spell, the spell descrip-
tion will mention the fact. The spell description
also explains the effect of a successful save. You
can learn more about saving throws in Chapter 8
on page 109.

Reversible Spells

  Some spells can be cast "reversed," meaning
that they result in an effect opposite to the effect
normally described for the spell. For example,
when a cleric casts a reversed healing spell, it
harms the recipient.
  On the spell lists you'll find in this chapter,
any spell marked with an asterisk (*) may be re-
versed; the spell description will explain what
the reversed spell does if it is not self-evident. If
a spell name is not marked with an asterisk, the
spell is not reversible.
  Magic-users must memorize their spells in the
reversed form in order to use them reversed.
Clerics, on the other hand, will learn their spells
through meditation, and can decide during the
casting whether to cast them in proper or re-
versed form.

Multiple Spell Effects
  Some spells can be used to temporarily im-
prove a character's attack rolls, damage rolls, sav-
ing throws, and other abilities.
  As a general rule, casting the same spell twice
on someone doesn't do any good; the spells' ef-
fects do not combine, even if they were cast by
two different characters. For instance, two haste
spells (described further in this chapter) do not
combine to allow a target character to attack at
four times the normal rate; only the first haste
will take effect.
  Different spells, on the other hand, or the ef-
fects of spells and magical items, will usually
combine successfully. For example, a bless spell
gives a character a +1 to his attack roll; so does a
magical sword with a +1 bonus. If a character
with a magical sword +1 is blessed by a cleric,
the two bonuses combine and he has a + 2 add-
ed to his attack roll (in addition to normal
Strength bonuses).

 Clerical Spells

    Clerical spells tend to be less flashy than
 magic-user spells. Clerical magic primarily in-
 volves healing, divination of truth, protection
 from harm, and so forth. Seldom do you see cler-
 ical spells as forceful and dramatic as the magic-
 user's lightning bolt. On the other hand, clerics
 can fight well and don't need such spells.

[RC page 33: learning spells]
Learning Spells
To learn a spell, the cleric meditates, petitioning the power he serves. The memory and details of the spells appear in the cleric's mind. The cleric may cast the spells at any time thereafter. The cleric will remember each spell until it is cast, even if it is not used for days or weeks.

As a player, all you need to do is choose whatever spells you want your character to have. This can only be done when the cleric has had a good night's sleep and immediately has a full hour when he does not have to do anything strenuous.

The cleric can meditate in a certain amount of noise: the sound of a camp readying itself in the morning, the normal bustling of a house or inn, even while people are trying to talk with him. He's not totally cut off from his surroundings, and can put up a hand or say a few words to forestall further interruption. But it's not possible for the cleric to meditate in the middle of a battle.

If the cleric learned spells on a previous day that he no longer wants to have available to him, he can opt to forget them and meditate on new spells.

 * Reversible Spell

[RC page 34: clerical spellcasting guidance]

Number and Types of Spells
   The cleric may know at any one time the num-
ber of spells appropriate for his experience level,
as shown on the cleric's experience table in
Chapter 2.
   The cleric may know any clerical spell from the
list of clerical spells so long as he is of a high
enough experience level to know it and cast it,
and so long as the DM has not banned the use of
that particular spell in his campaign. The cleric
cannot learn a spell from either the druidic spells
list or the magical spells list.

Reversible Spells

  A cleric may reverse a spell simply by casting it
backward. The player simply says, "My cleric is
casting the spell in reverse."
  However, Lawful clerics prefer not to cast
spells in reversed form. They only cast the re-
versed forms in extreme life-or-death situations.

Chaotic clerics often use the reversed spells, and
only use the normal forms to benefit their
friends. Neutral clerics can choose to cast the
normal or the reversed forms.

List of Clerical Spells
  Following is a list of clerical spells and their
descriptions. They're divided up into spell levels
and set in alphabetical order. All spells marked
with an asterisk (*) can be cast in reversed form.

First Level Clerical Spells
Cure Light Wounds*
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Any one living creature

   This spell either heals damage or removes pa-
ralysis. If used to heal, it can cure 2-7 (1d6 + 1)
points of damage. It cannot heal damage if used

[RC page 34: first clerical spell entries]
  to cure paralysis. The cleric may cast it on him-
  self if desired.
     This spell cannot increase a creature's total hit
  points above the original amount.
     When reversed, this spell, cause light wounds,
  causes 1d6 + 1 (2-7) points of damage to any
  creature or character touched (no saving throw is
  allowed). The cleric must make a normal attack
  roll to inflict this damage.

  Detect Evil
  Range: 120'
  Duration: 6 turns
  Effect: Everything within 120'

     When this spell is cast, the cleric will see evilly
  enchanted objects within 120' glow. It will also
  cause creatures that want to harm the cleric to
  glow when they are within range. The actual
  thoughts of the creatures cannot be heard. Re-
  member that a Chaotic alignment does not auto-
  matically mean Evil, although many Chaotic
  monsters have evil intentions. Traps and poison
  are neither good nor evil, merely dangerous; this
  spell does not reveal them.

  Detect Magic
  Range: 0
  Duration: 2 turns
  Effect: Everything within 60'

     When this spell is cast, the cleric will see a
  glow surround magical objects, creatures, and
  places within the spell's effect. The glow will not
  last very long; clerics should normally use the
  spell only when they want to know if particular
  objects already within sight are, in fact, magical.
  For example, a door may be held shut magically,
  a stranger might actually be an enchanted mon-
  ster, or a treasure might be enchanted.

  Light*
  Range: 120'
  Duration: 12 turns
  Effect: Volume of 30' diameter

     This spell creates a large ball of light, as if cast
  by a bright torch or lamp. If the spell is cast on
  an object (such as the cleric's weapon), the light
  will move with the object.
     If the spell is cast at a creature's eyes, the vic-
  tim must make a saving throw vs. spell. If he fails
  the saving throw, the victim will be blinded by
  the light for the duration of the spell, or until
  the spell effect is canceled.
     When reversed, this spell, darkness, creates a

  circle of darkness 30' in diameter. It will block all
  sight except infravision. Darkness will cancel a
  light spell if cast upon it, but may itself be can-
  celed by another light spell. If cast at an oppo-
  nent's eyes, darkness causes blindness for the
  duration of the spell or until canceled. If the tar-
  get makes a successful saving throw vs. spell, the
  spell misses.

  Protection from Evil
  Range: 0
  Duration: 12 turns
  Effect: The cleric only

     This spell creates an invisible magical barrier
  all around the cleric's body (less than an inch
away). While the spell lasts, characters and mon-
sters attacking the cleric are penalized by - 1 to
their attack rolls, and the cleric gains a + 1 bonus
to all saving throws.
In addition, enchanted creatures cannot even
touch the cleric! (An enchanted creature is one
that normal weapons will not affect, one which
only magical weapons can hit. A creature that
can only be hit by a silver weapon—a werewolf,
for example—is not an enchanted creature. Any
creature that is magically summoned or con-
trolled, such as a charmed character, is also con-
sidered to be an enchanted creature.) The barrier
thus completely protects the cleric from all melee
or hand-to-hand attacks from such creatures;
however, it cannot prevent attacks from missile
weapons. Enchanted creatures using missile
weapons still suffer the - 1 penalty to the attack
roll, but they can hit the cleric.
This spell will not affect a magic missile spell
used by magic-users.
If the cleric attacks an enchanted creature dur-
ing the spell's duration, the spell's effect changes
slightly. Enchanted creatures are then able to
touch the magic-user, but still suffer the attack
roll penalty; the penalty and the cleric's saving
throw adjustments still apply until the spell du-
ration ends.
Purify Food and Water
Range: 10'
Duration: Permanent
Effect: See below
This spell will make spoiled or poisoned food
and water safe and usable. It will purify one ra-
tion of preserved food (either iron or standard
rations)., or six waterskins of water, or enough
normal food to feed a dozen people. If cast at
mud, the spell will cause the dirt to settle, leav-
ing a pool of pure, clear water. The spell will not
affect any living creature.
Remove Fear*
Range: Touch
Duration: 2 turns
Effect: Any one living creature
When the cleric casts this spell and then
touches any living creature, the spell will calm
the creature and remove any fear. If the creature
has been affected by a fear spell or effect which
does not normally allow a saving throw, the re-
move fear spell can still be useful. If the cleric
casts the spell on someone afflicted by a magical
fear effect, the victim gets to make a saving
throw vs. spells, adding a bonus to the roll equal
to the cleric's level of experience (up to a maxi-
mum bonus of +6). If the saving throw is suc-
cessful, the victim's fear is negated. Regardless of
the cleric's level or any bonuses, a roll of 1 will
always fail.
The reversed form of the spell, cause fear, will
make any one creature flee for two turns. The
victim may make a saving throw vs. spells to
avoid the effect. This reversed spell has a range
of 120'.
Resist Cold
Range: 0
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: All creatures within 30'
When this spell is cast, all creatures within 30'
of the cleric can withstand freezing temperatures
without harm. In addition, those affected gain a
bonus of + 2 to all saving throws against cold at-
tacks. Furthermore, any damage from cold is re-
duced by 1 point per die of damage (but with a
minimum of 1 point of damage per die). The ef-
fect will move with the cleric.
Second Level Clerical Spells
Bless*
Range: 60'
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: All within a 20' square area
This spell improves the morale of friendly
creatures by +1 and gives the recipients a +1
bonus on all attack and damage rolls. It will only
affect creatures in a 20' X 20' area, and only
those who are not yet in melee.
When reversed, this spell, blight, places a - 1
penalty on enemies' morale, attack rolls, and
damage rolls. Each victim may make a saving
throw vs. spells to avoid the penalties.
Find Traps
Range: 0 (Cleric only)
Duration: 2 turns
Effect: Traps within 30' glow
This spell causes all mechanical and magical
traps to glow with a dull blue light when the
cleric comes within 30' of them. It does not re-
veal the types of traps, nor any method of re-
moving them. Note that an ambush is not a
trap, nor is a natural hazard, such as quicksand.
Hold Person*
Range: 180'
Duration: 9 turns
Effect: Paralyzes up to 4 creatures
The hold person spell will affect any human,
demihuman, or human-like creature (bugbear,
dryad, gnoll, hobgoblin, kobold, lizard man,
ogre, orc, nixie, pixie or sprite, for instance). It
will not affect the undead or creatures larger than
ogres. Each victim must make a saving throw vs.
spells or be paralyzed for nine turns. The spell
may be cast at a single person or at a group. If cast
at a single person, the victim suffers a — 2 penalty
to the saving throw. If cast at a group, it will affect
up to four persons (of the cleric's choice), but with
no penalty to their rolls. The paralysis may only be
removed by the reversed form of the spell, or by a
dispel magic spell.
The reverse of the spell, free person, removes
the paralysis of up to four victims of the normal
form of the spell (including hold person cast by a
magic-user or an elf). It has no other effect; it
does not, for instance, remove the effects of a
ghoul's paralysis ability.
Know Alignment*
Range: 0 (Cleric only)
Duration: 1 round
Effect: One creature within 10'
The caster of this spell may discover the align-
ment (Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic) of any one
creature within 10'. The spell may also be used
to find the alignment of an enchanted item or
area (if any).
The reverse of the spell, confuse alignment,
lasts for one turn per level of the caster, and may
be cast on any one creature, by touch. No saving
throw is allowed. For as long as the spell lasts, a
cleric trying to identify the alignment of the re-
cipient by using the normal know alignment
spell will get a false answer. That same false an-
swer will be the result of any further attempts.
Resist Fire
Range: 30'
Duration: 2 turns
Effect: One living creature
For the duration of this spell, normal fire and
heat cannot harm the spell's recipient. The re-
cipient also gains a + 2 bonus on all saving
throws against magical fire (dragon's breath,
fireball, etc.). Furthermore, damage from such
fire is reduced by 1 point per die of damage
(though each die will inflict at least 1 point of
damage, regardless of adjustments). Red dragon
breath damage is reduced by 1 point per Hit Die
of the creature (again, to no less than 1 point of
damage per Hit Die).
Silence 15' Radius
Range: 180'
Duration: 12 turns
Effect: Sphere of silence 30' across
This spell makes the area of effect totally si-
lent. Conversation and spellcasting in this area
are impossible for the duration of the spell. This
spell does not prevent a person within the area
from hearing noises outside the area. If cast on a
creature, the victim must make a saving throw
vs. spells or the spell effects will move with the
creature. If the saving throw is successful, the
spell remains in the area in which it was cast, and
the victim may move out of the area.
Snake Charm
Range: 60'
Duration: 2-5 rounds or 2-5 turns
Effect: Charms 1 HD of snakes per level of the
caster
With this spell, a cleric may charm 1 Hit Die
of snakes for each level of experience he has, and
no saving throw is allowed. A 5th level cleric
could charm one 5 HD snake, five 1 HD snakes,
or any combination totalling 5 Hit Dice or less.
The snakes affected will rise up and sway, but
will not attack unless attacked themselves.
If the cleric uses the spell on snakes attacking
him, the spell's duration is 1d4 + 1 (2-5) rounds;
otherwise, it lasts 1d4 +1 (2-5) turns. When the
spell wears off, the snakes return to normal (but
with normal reactions; they will not be automat-
ically hostile).
Speak with Animals
Range: 0 (Cleric only)
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: Allows conversation within 30'
When casting this spell, the cleric must name
one type of animal (such as wolves). For the du-
ration of the spell, the cleric may speak with all
animals of that type if they are within 30'; the
effect moves with the caster.
The cleric can speak to any normal or giant
forms of the specific animal type named, but on-
ly to one type at a time. The caster may not use
this spell to speak to intelligent animals and
fantastic creatures.
The creatures spoken to usually have favorable
reactions ( + 2 bonus to the reaction roll), and
they can be talked into doing a favor for the cler-
ic if the reaction roll is high enough. The animal
must be able to understand the request and
must be able to perform it.
Third Level Clerical Spells
Continual Light*
Range: 120'
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Sphere of light 60' across
This spell creates light as bright as daylight in
a spherical volume of 30' radius. It lasts until a
dispel magic or continual darkness spell is cast
upon it. Creatures penalized in bright daylight
suffer the same penalties within this spell effect
(for example, goblins, which suffer a - 1 attack
roll penalty in daylight, suffer the same penalty
within the effect of continual light).
If the spell is cast on an opponent's eyes, the
victim must make a saving throw vs. spells or be
blinded until the effect is removed. This spell
may be cast in an area, upon an object, or on a
person or creature; it can also be cast directly on a
person's or creature's eyes, thus blinding him.
The reverse of this spell, continual darkness,
creates a completely dark volume of the same
size. Torches, lanterns, and even a light spell will
not affect it, and infravision cannot penetrate it.
A continual light spell will, however, cancel it. If
cast on a creature's eyes, the creature must make
a saving throw vs. spells or be blinded (with the
same effects as blindness from the normal con-
tinual light until the spell is removed.
Cure Blindness
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Effect: One living creature
This spell will cure nearly any form of blind-
ness, including those caused by light or darkness
spells (whether normal or continual). It will not,
however, affect blindness caused by a curse.
Cure Disease*
Range: 30'
Duration: Permanent
Effect: One living creature within range
This spell will cure any living creature of one
disease, such as those caused by a mummy or
green slime. If cast by a cleric of llth level or
greater, this spell will also cure lycanthropy.
The reverse of this spell, cause disease, infects
the victim with a hideous wasting disease unless
he successfully makes a saving throw vs. spells. A
diseased victim has a -2 penalty on all attack
rolls. In addition, the victim's wounds cannot be
magically cured, and natural healing takes twice
as long as usual. The disease is fatal in 2d12 (2-
24) days unless removed by a cure disease spell.
Growth of Animal
Range: 120'
Duration: 12 turns
Effect: Doubles the size of one animal
This spell doubles the size of one normal or
giant animal. The animal then has twice its nor-
mal strength and inflicts double its normal dam-
age. It may also carry twice its normal
encumbrance. This spell does not change an ani-
mal's behavior, armor class, or hit points, and
does not affect intelligent animal races or
fantastic creatures.
Locate Object
Range: 0 (Cleric only)
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: Detects one object within 120'
This spell allows the cleric to sense the direc-
tion of one known object. It gives no informa-
tion about distance. It can detect a common
object with only a partial description (such as
"stairs leading up") but it will only reveal the
direction to the closest such object. To find a spe-
cific object, the cleric must know exactly what
the object looks like (size, shape, color, etc.).
The spell will not locate a creature.
Remove Curse*
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Removes any one curse
This spell removes one curse, whether on a
character, item, or area. Some curses—especially
those on magical items—may only be removed
for a short time, at the DM's discretion; such
curses would require a dispel evil spell for per-
manent removal (or possibly a remove curse cast
by a high level cleric or magic-user, again at
DM's discretion).
The reverse of this spell, curse, causes a mis-
fortune or penalty to affect the victim. Curses are
limited only by the caster's imagination, but if
an attempted curse is too powerful, it may return
to the caster (DM's discretion)! Safe limits to
curses may include: -4 penalty on attack rolls;
— 2 penalty on saving throws; prime requisite re-
duced to half normal; — 4 penalty on others' re-
action rolls to him. The victim may make a
saving throw vs. spells to avoid the curse.
Speak with the Dead
Range: 10'
Duration: 1 round per level of the cleric
Effect: Cleric may ask three questions
By means of this spell, a cleric may ask three
questions of a deceased spirit if the body is with-
in range.
A cleric of 6th or 7th level can contact recently
deceased spirits (those dead up to 4 days). Clerics
of levels 8-14 have slightly more power (contact-
ing spirits up to 4 months dead), and clerics of
levels 15-20 have even more (speaking with
corpses up to 4 years dead). No time limits apply
to clerics of 21st level or greater.
The spirit will always reply in a tongue known
to the cleric, but can only offer knowledge of
things up to the time of its death. If the spirit's
alignment is the same as the cleric's, it will pro-
vide clear and brief answers; however, if the
alignments differ, the spirit may reply in riddles.
Striking
Range: 30'
Duration: 1 turn
Effect: 1d6 bonus to damage on 1 weapon
This spell allows any one weapon to inflict 1d6
additional points of damage per attack (like a
magical staff of striking). The weapon will inflict
this extra damage with every successful blow for
as long as the spell lasts. This bonus does not ap-
ply to attack rolls, but only to damage rolls.
If the cleric casts this spell on a normal weap-
on, the weapon may then damage creatures
which are normally affected only by magic weap-
ons; the weapon will do 1d6 points of damage
per strike (regardless of the normal damage of
the weapon).
Fourth Level Clerical Spells
Animate Dead
Range: 60'
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Creates zombies or skeletons
This spell allows the caster to make animated,
enchanted skeletons or zombies from normal
skeletons or dead bodies within range. These an-
imated undead creatures will obey the cleric un-
til they are destroyed by another cleric or a dispel
magic spell.
For each experience level of the cleric, he may
animate one Hit Die of undead. A skeleton has
the same Hit Dice as the original creature, but a
zombie has one Hit Die more than the original.
Note that this doesn't count character experi-
ence levels as Hit Dice: For purposes of this spell,
all humans and demihumans are 1 HD crea-
tures, so the remains of a 9th level thief would
be animated as a zombie with 2 HD.
Animated creatures do not have any spells,
but are immune to sleep and charm effects and
poison. Lawful clerics must take care to use this
spell only for good purpose. Animating the dead
is usually a Chaotic act.
Create Water
Range: 10'
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: Creates one magical spring
With this spell, the cleric summons forth an
enchanted spring from the ground or a wall. The
spring will flow for an hour, creating enough wa-
ter for 12 men and their mounts (for that day,
about 50 gallons). For each of the cleric's experi-
ence levels above 8, water for twelve additional
men and mounts is created; thus a 10th level
cleric could create water for 36 men and horses.
The cleric doesn't have to create the maxi-
mum amount of water if he doesn't wish to. He
might wish to create a spring which will flow for
half an hour, or a few minutes; the player need
only tell the GM how many gallons he wants the
spell to create, up to the spell's maximum.
Cure Serious Wounds*
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Any one living creature
This spell is similar to a cure light wounds
spell, but will cure one creature of 2d6 + 2 (4-14)
points of damage.
The reverse of this spell, cause serious
wounds, causes 2d6 + 2 points of damage to any
creature or character touched (no saving throw).
The caster must make a normal attack roll to suc-
cessfully cast the cause serious wounds spell.
Dispel Magic
Range: 120'
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Destroys spells in a 20' cube
This spell destroys other spell effects in a cubic
volume of 20' x 20' x 20'. It does not affect mag-
ical items. Spell effects created by a caster
(whether cleric, druid, magic-user, or elf) of a
level equal to or lower than the caster of the dis-
pel magic are automatically and immediately de-
stroyed. Spell effects created by a higher-level
caster might not be affected. The chance of fail-
ure is 5% per level of difference between the
casters. For example, a 7th level cleric trying to
dispel a web spell cast by a 9th level magic-user
would have a 10% chance of failure.
Dispel magic will not affect a magical item
(such as a scroll, a magical sword, etc.). How-
ever, it can dispel the effects of the magical item
when that item is used (for example, a spellcaster
can cast dispel magic on the victim of a ring of
human control and snap him out of that control,
or on a flaming weapon to douse the flame).
Neutralize Poison*
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Effect: A creature, container, or object
This spell will make poison harmless either in
a creature, a container (such as a bottle), or on
one object (such as a chest). It will even revive a
victim slain by poison if cast within 10 rounds of
the poisoning!
The spell will affect any and all poisons
present at the time it is cast, but does not cure
any damage (and will thus not revive a poisoned
victim who has died of wounds).
The reverse of this spell, create poison, may be
cast, by touch, on a creature or container. A cler-
ic cannot cast it on any other object. A victim
must make a saving throw vs. poison or be im-
mediately slain by the poison. If cast on a con-
tainer, the spell poisons its contents; no saving
throw applies, even for magical containers or
contents (such as potions). (Of course, when
someone drinks those poisoned contents, he gets
a saving throw.) Using create poison, or poison-
ing in any case, is usually a Chaotic act.
Protection from Evil 10' Radius
Range: 0
Duration: 12 turns
Effect: Barrier 20' diameter
This spell creates an invisible magical barrier
all around the caster, extending for a 10' radius
in all directions. The spell serves as protection
from attacks by monsters of an alignment other
than the caster's. Each creature within the barri-
er gains a +1 to all saving throws, and all attacks
against those within are penalized by - 1 to the
attacker's attack roll while the spell lasts.
In addition, enchanted creatures cannot at-
tack those within the barrier in hand-to-hand
(melee) combat. (An enchanted creature is any
creature which is magically summoned or con-
trolled, such as a charmed character, or one that
is not harmed by normal weapons. A creature
that can be hit only by a silver weapon—a were-
wolf, for example—is not an enchanted crea-
ture.)
If anyone within the barrier attacks an en-
chanted creature, the barrier will no longer pre-
vent the creature from attacking hand-to-hand,
but the bonus to saving throws and penalty to
attack rolls will still apply.
Attackers, including enchanted creatures, can
attack people inside the barrier by using missile
or magical attacks. They do suffer the — 1 penal-
ty to attack rolls, but that is the only penalty
they suffer.
Speak with Plants
Range: 0 (Cleric only)
Duration: 3 turns
Effect: All plants within 30'
This spell enables the cleric to talk to plants as
though they are intelligent. The cleric may re-
quest a simple favor, and the plants will grant it
if it is within the plants' power to understand
and perform. This spell may be used to allow the
cleric and party to pass through otherwise im-
penetrable undergrowth. It will also allow the
cleric to communicate with plantlike monsters
(such as treants).
Sticks to Snakes
Range: 120'
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: Up to 16 sticks
This spell turns 2d8 sticks into snakes (de-
tailed below). The snakes may be poisonous
(50% chance per snake; the DM can roll 1d6 for
each snake; on a roll of 1-3, the snake is poison-
ous). They obey the cleric's commands, but will
turn back into sticks when slain or when the
spell's duration ends.
Snakes: NA 2d8 (2d8); AC 6, HD 1; AT 1
bite; Dmg 1d4; MV 90' (30'); Save Fl; ML 12;
TT Nil; AL Neutral; SA poison (50% chance
for each snake to be poisonous); XP 10 (non-
poisonous) or 13 (poisonous).
Fifth Level Clerical Spells
Commune
Range: 0 (Cleric only)
Duration: 3 turns
Effect: 3 questions
This spell allows the cleric to ask questions of
the greater powers (whatever forces of nature,
greater spirits, or legendary Immortals the DM
has created for this campaign world). The cleric
may ask three questions that can be answered
"yes" or "no."
A cleric may commune only once a week. If
the clerics in the campaign are using the spell too
often, the DM may wish to limit its use to once a
month. Once a year the cleric may ask twice the
normal number of questions. The DM might
wish to establish that this must occur on a day
which is significant to the greater powers being
questioned.
Create Food
Range: 10'
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Creates food for 12 or more
This spell creates enough normal food to feed
up to 12 men and their mounts for one day. For
every level of the cleric above 8th, the spell cre-
ates enough food for 12 additional men and
mounts. The cleric doesn't have to create the
maximum amount of food if he doesn't wish to;
he can create a lesser amount. Created food
spoils after 24 hours; therefore it is impossible to
lay in a big store of food created by this spell.
Cure Critical Wounds*
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Any one living creature
This spell is similar to a cure light wounds
spell, but will cure one living creature of 3d6 + 3
(6-21) points of damage.
The reverse of this spell (cause critical wounds)
causes 3d6 + 3 (6-21) points of damage to any
living creature or character touched (no saving
throw). The caster must make a normal attack
roll to cause the critical wound.
Dispel Evil
Range: 30'
Duration: 1 turn
Effect: Enchanted or undead monsters or one
curse or charm
This spell may affect all undead and enchant-
ed (summoned, controlled, and animated) mon-
sters within range. It will destroy the monster
unless each victim makes a saving throw vs.
spells. If cast at only one creature, that creature
takes a —2 penalty to the saving throw. Any
creature from another plane is banished (forced
to return to its home plane) if it fails the saving
throw. Even if the victims successfully roll their
saving throws, they must flee the area, and will
stay away as long as the caster concentrates; the
caster cannot move while concentrating.
This spell will also remove the curse from any
one cursed item, or may be used to remove the
influence of any magical charm.
Insect Plague
Range: 480'
Duration: 1 day
Effect: Creates a swarm of 30' radius
This spell summons a vast swarm of insects.
The swarm obscures vision and drives off crea-
tures of less than 3 Hit Dice (no saving throw).
The swarm moves at up to 20' per round as di-
rected by the cleric while it is within range. The
caster must concentrate, without moving, to
control the swarm. If the caster is disturbed, the.
insects scatter and the spell ends. This spell only
works outdoors and above-ground.
Quest*
Range: 30'
Duration: Special
Effect: Compels one living creature
This spell forces the victim to perform some
special task or quest, as commanded by the cast-
er. The victim may make a saving throw vs.
spells; if he succeeds, the spell does not affect
him.
A typical task might involve slaying a certain
monster, rescuing a prisoner, obtaining a magi-
cal item for the caster, or going on a pilgrimage.
If the task is impossible or suicidal, the spell has
no effect. Once the task is completed, the spell
ends.
The spell forces the victim to undertake a task,
but doesn't force him to like it. Once the task is
accomplished, the victim might wish to exact re-
venge on the cleric, just depending on the cir-
cumstances of the adventure. Any victim
refusing to go on the quest is cursed until the
quest is continued. The type of curse is decided
by the DM, but may be double normal strength.
The reverse of this spell, remove quest, may
be used to dispel an unwanted quest or a quest-
related curse. The chance of success is 50%,
modified by 5% for every level of the caster dif-
fers from the level of the caster of the first quest.
Thus, an 11th level cleric attempting to remove a
quest cast by a 13th level cleric has only a 40%
chance of success; a 36th level cleric attempting
to remove a quest cast by a 20th level cleric has a
130% chance (reduced to 99% to provide for a
1% chance of failure).
Raise Dead*
Range: 120'
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Body of one human or demihuman
By means of this spell, the cleric can raise any
human, dwarf, halfling, or elf from the dead.
The body must be present, and if part is missing,
the raised character will be disabled accordingly.
An 8th level cleric can raise a body that has
been dead for up to four days. For each level of
the cleric above 8th, add four days to this time.
Thus, a 10th level cleric can raise bodies that
have been dead for up to twelve days.
The recipient returns to life with 1 hit point,
and cannot fight, cast spells, use abilities, carry
heavy loads, or move at more than half speed.
These penalties will disappear after two full
weeks of complete bed rest, but the healing can-
not be speeded by magic.
The cleric may also cast this spell at any one
undead creature within range. The undead crea-
ture will be destroyed unless it makes a saving
throw vs. spells with a - 2 penalty. However, a
vampire which fails its saving throw is not de-
stroyed, merely forced to retreat to its coffin, in
gaseous form, as fast as possible. When cast at an
undead creature of more Hit Dice than a vam-
pire, this spell inflicts 3d10 (3-30) points of
damage. The creature can make a saving throw
vs. spells to take half damage.
The reverse of this spell, finger of death, cre-
ates a death ray that will kill any one living crea-
ture within 60'. The victim may make a saving
throw vs. death ray to avoid the effect. A Lawful
cleric will only use finger of death in a life-or-
death situation. Finger of death will actually
cure 3d10 (3-30) points of damage for any un-
dead with 10 or more Hit Dice (phantom,
haunt, spirit, nightshade, or special).
Truesight
Range: 0 (cleric only)
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round per level of caster.
Effect: Reveals all things
When he casts this spell, the cleric is able to
see all things within 120'. The spell is quite pow-
erful; the cleric can clearly see all hidden, invisi-
ble, and ethereal objects and creatures as with
the magic-user detect invisible spell. In addi-
tion, any secret doors as well as things or crea-
tures not in their true form—whether
polymorphed, disguised, or otherwise—are seen
as they truly are, with no possibility of decep-
tion. Alignment is also "seen," as is experience
and power.
Sixth Level Clerical Spells
Aerial Servant
Range: 60'
Duration: 1 day per level of caster
Effect: Servant fetches one item or creature
An aerial servant is a very intelligent being
from the elemental plane. With this spell, the
cleric summons one of these beings, which ap-
pears immediately. The cleric must then describe
one creature or item and its location to the ser-
vant, or else it will depart. When it hears this
description and location, the aerial servant
leaves, trying to find the item or creature and
bring it to the cleric. The servant will take as
much time as needed, up to the limit of the du-
ration. If the spell's duration lapses before the
task is completed, even if the aerial servant is al-
ready bringing the target back to the caster, the
aerial servant has failed to accomplish its task.
See below for further details.
The aerial servant has 18 Strength, and can
carry up to 500 lbs (5,000 cn). It can become
ethereal at will, and thus can travel to most plac-
es easily. However, it cannot pass through a pro-
tection from evil spell effect.
If it cannot perform its duty within the dura-
tion of the spell, the servant becomes insane and
returns to attack the caster.
See Chapter 14 for a full description of the
aerial servant.
Animate Objects
Range: 60'
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: Causes objects to move
The cleric may use this spell to cause any non-
living, nonmagical objects to move and attack.
Magical objects are not affected. The spell can
animate any one object up to 400 lbs (4,000 cn)
(roughly the size of two men), or a number of
smaller objects whose total weight does not ex-
ceed 400 lbs.
The DM must decide on the movement rate,
number of attacks, damage, and other combat
details of the objects animated. As a guideline, a
man-sized statue might move at 30' per round,
attack once per round for 2d8 (2-16) points of
damage, and have an armor class of 1. A chair
might only be AC 6, but move at 180' per round
on its four legs, attacking twice per round for
1d4 points per attack. All objects have the same
chances to hit as the cleric animating them.
Barrier*
Range: 60'
Duration: 12 turns
Effect: Creates whirling hammers
This spell creates a magical barrier in an area
up to 30' in diameter and 30' high. The barrier is
a wall of whirling and dancing hammers, obvi-
ously dangerous to any who come in contact with
it. Any creature passing through the barrier
takes 7d10 (7-70) points of damage from the
whirling hammers (no saving throw allowed).
This spell is often used to block an entrance or
passage.
The reverse of this spell (remove barrier) will
destroy any one barrier created by a cleric. It can
also be used to destroy a magic-user's wall of ice,
wall of fire, clothform, woodform, or wall of
stone spell effects. It will not affect the magic-
user spells wall of iron, stoneform, ironform or
steelform.
Create Normal Animals
Range: 30'
Duration: 10 turns
Effect: Creates 1-6 loyal animals
The cleric is able to create normal animals
from thin air with this spell. The animals will ap-
pear at a point chosen (within 30'), but may
thereafter be sent (by command) up to 240'
away, if desired. The animals created will under-
stand and obey the cleric at all times. They will
fight if so commanded, and will perform other
actions (carrying, watching, etc.) to the best of
their abilities. They are normal animals, and
may attack others unless their instructions are
carefully worded.
The cleric may choose the number of animals
created, but not the exact type; the DM should
decide, or even randomly determine, what sort
of animals appear. The spell will create one large
animal (elephant, hippopotamus, etc.), three
medium-sized animals (bear, great cat, etc.), or
six small animals (wolf, rock baboon, etc.). The
spell cannot create giant animals. The animals
disappear when slain or when the spell duration
ends.
Cureall
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Cures anything
This spell is the most powerful of the healing
spells. When used to cure wounds, it cures near-
ly all damage, leaving the recipient with only
1d6 points of damage. (Restore the victim to full
starting hit points, then roll 1d6 and subtract
that amount from the victim's hit point total.)
The spell can remove a curse, neutralize a poi-
son, cure paralysis, cure a disease, cure blind-
ness, or even remove a feeblemind effect instead
of healing. However, it will cure one thing only;
if the recipient is suffering from two or more af-
flictions (such as wounds and a curse), the cleric
must name the ailment the spell is intended to
cure.
If cast on the recipient of a raise dead spell,
the cureall eliminates the need for two weeks of
bed rest; the recipient can immediately function
normally. This is the only form of magical curing
that will work on a newly-raised creature.
Find the Path
Range: 0 (Cleric only)
Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn per level of the caster
Effect: Shows the path to an area
When casting this spell, the cleric must name
a specific place, though it need not be a place he
has visited before. For the duration of the spell,
the cleric knows the direction to that place. In
addition, the cleric will magically gain any spe-
cial knowledge needed to get to the place; for
example, he would know the location of secret
doors, passwords, and so forth.
When the spell's duration runs out, the caster
only remembers the general direction to the
place. All other special information is forgotten.
The spell is instantly negated is the caster at-
tempts to write down, record, or disclose that
special knowledge to others. This spell is often
used to find a fast escape route.
Speak with Monsters*
Range: 0 (Cleric only)
Duration: 1 round per level of the cleric
Effect: Permits conversation with any monster
This spell gives the caster the power to ask
questions of any and all living and undead crea-
tures within 30'. Even unintelligent monsters
will understand and respond to the cleric. Those
spoken to will not attack the cleric while engaged
in conversation, but may defend themselves or
flee if attacked. The cleric may ask only one
question per round, and the spell lasts one
round per level of the caster.
The reverse of this spell, babble, has a 60'
range, a duration of 1 turn per level of the caster,
and affects one target within spell range. The
victim may make a saving throw vs. spells to
avoid the effect, but with a — 2 penalty to the
roll. If he fails the saving throw, the victim can-
not communicate with any other creature for the
duration of the spell. Even hand motions, writ-
ten notes, telepathy, and all other forms of com-
munication will seem garbled. This does not
interfere with the victim's spellcasting (if any),
but does prevent him from using any magical
items which are activated by command words—
the command words turn into gibberish.
Word of Recall
Range: 0 (Cleric only)
Duration: Instantaneous
Effect: Teleports the caster to sanctuary
Similar to a magic-user's teleport spell, this
spell carries the cleric and all equipment carried
(but no other creatures) to the cleric's home, re-
gardless of the distance. The cleric must have a
permanent home (such as a castle), and a medi-
tation room within that home; this room is the
destination when the spell is cast. During the
round in which this spell is cast, the cleric auto-
matically gains initiative unless surprised.
Seventh Level Clerical Spells
Earthquake
Range: 120 yards
Duration: 1 turn
Effect: Causes earth tremors
This powerful spell causes a section of earth to
shake, and opens large cracks in the ground. A
17th level caster can affect an area up to 60'
square, adding 5' to each dimension with each
experience level above 17th. For example, an
18th level cleric affects an area up to 65' square;
19th level, 70' square; and so forth.
Within the area of effect, all small dwellings
are reduced to rubble, and larger constructions
are cracked open. Earthen formations (hills,
cliffsides, etc.) form rockslides. Cracks in the
earth may open and engulf 1 creature in 6 (de-
termined randomly), crushing them (when the
die roll randomly determines that a character is
in danger of falling into a crack and being
crushed, the character gets a saving throw vs.
death to escape falling in).
Holy Word
Range: 0
Duration: Instantaneous
Effect: All creatures within 40'
This spell affects all creatures, friend or foe,
within a circular area of 40' radius, centered on
the caster. When the cleric casts this spell, all
creatures of alignments other than the cleric's are
affected as follows (no saving throw vs. spells al-
lowed):
Holy Word Effects
Up to 5th Level:
Killed
Level 6-8:
Stunned 2d10 turns
Level 9-12:
Deafened 1d6 turns
Level 13 + :
Stunned 1d10 rounds
Any victim of 13th level (or Hit Dice) or high-
er, or any victim of the same alignment as the
caster, may make a saving throw vs. spells to
avoid all spell effects. This powerful spell cannot
be blocked by stone, nor by any other solid ma-
terial except lead. It can, however, be blocked by
an anti-magic shell.
Raise Dead Fully*
Range: 60'
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Raises any living creature
This spell is similar to the 5th level spell raise
dead, except that it can raise any living
creature—not just humans and demihumans.
Any human or demihuman recipient awakens
immediately, with full hit points, and is able to
fight, use abilities, spells known, etc., without
any penalties—except those penalties the crea-
ture already possessed at the time of death. For
example, a victim cursed or diseased at death
would still suffer the affliction when raised fully.
If any other living creature (other than a hu-
man or demihuman) is the recipient, the guide-
lines given in the raise dead spell apply
(including time limitations, rest needed, etc.).
A 17th level cleric can use this spell on a hu-
man or demihuman body that has been dead up
to 4 months; for each level of experience above
17th, this time increases 4 months. Thus, a 19th
level cleric could cast raise dead fully on a body
that has been dead up to 12 months.
The spell is fatal to undead. Cast on an un-
dead creature of 7 Hit Dice or less, the spell im-
mediately destroys the creature (no saving
throw). The spell forces an undead creature of 7
to 12 Hit Dice to make a saving throw vs. spells,
with a - 4 penalty to the roll; if the creature fails
the roll, it is destroyed. The spell inflicts 6d10
(6-60) points of damage upon an undead mon-
ster of more than 12 Hit Dice, but the victim
may make a saving throw vs. spells to take half
damage.
The reverse of this spell (obliterate) will affect
a living creature just as the normal form affects
undead (destroy 7 Hit Dice or less, et al.). If cast
at an undead creature of any type, obliterate has
the same effect as a cureall would on a living
creature (curing all but 1d6 points of damage, or
curing blindness or feeblemind, etc.).
Restore*
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Restores 1 level lost to energy drain
This spell restores one full level of energy (ex-
perience) to any victim who has lost a level be-
cause of energy drain (for instance, from a
vampire's attack). It does not restore more than
one level, nor does it add a level if no level has
been lost. Furthermore, the cleric casting this
spell loses one level of experience, as if struck by
a wight when the spell is cast; however, the cler-
ic's loss is not permanent, and the cleric need on-
ly rest for 2d10 (2-20) days to regain the lost
experience.
The reverse of this spell, life drain, drains one
level of experience from the victim touched, just
like the touch of a wight or wraith. Casting the
reversed spell causes no experience level loss to
the cleric, nor does it require any rest afterward,
but it is a Chaotic act, avoided by Lawful clerics.
Survival
Range: Touch
Duration: One hour per level of the caster
Effect: Protects one creature against all non-
magical damage from the environment
This spell protects the recipient from adverse
conditions of all types, including normal heat or
cold, lack of air, and so forth. While die spell is in
effect, the caster needs no air, food, water, or sleep.
The spell does not protect against magical damage
of any type, attack damage, poisons, breath weap-
ons, or physical blows from creatures. It does pro-
tect against all damage caused by natural
conditions on other planes of existence.
For example, a cleric might use this spell: in a
desert or blizzard to prevent damage from the
natural conditions; underground or underwater,
enabling survival without air; in space, to magi-
cally survive in vacuum; or on the elemental
plane of Fire, to protect against conditional fire
damage.
Travel
Range: 0
Duration: One turn per level of the caster
Effect: Allows aerial or gaseous travel
This spell allows the cleric to move quickly
and freely, even between the planes of existence.
The caster (only) may fly in the same manner as
given by the magic-user's spell, at a rate of 360'
(120'). The cleric can also enter a nearby plane of
existence, simply by concentrating for one
round. He may enter a maximum of one plane
per turn.
The cleric may bring one other creature for
every five levels of experience (rounded down;
for example, a 29th level cleric could bring five
other creatures on the journey). To bring others,
he must touch them, or they must touch him,
while the spell is cast and the shift is made. Any
unwilling creature can make a saving throw vs.
spells to avoid the effect. The cleric must take
the others with him—he cannot send them
while remaining behind.
While this spell is in effect, the caster (only)
may assume gaseous form by concentrating for
one full round. (If he is interrupted, no change
occurs.) Unlike the potion effect, all equipment
carried also becomes part of the same gaseous
cloud. In this form, the caster may travel at dou-
ble the normal flying rate: 720' (240'). While
gaseous, the cleric cannot use items or cast spells,
but also cannot be damaged except by magic
(weapons or certain spells). Also, a gaseous being
cannot pass through a protection from evil spell
effect or an anti-magic shell.
Wish
Range: Special
Duration: Special
Effect: Special
A wish is the single most powerful spell a cler-
ic can have. It is never found on a scroll, but may
be placed elsewhere (in a ring, for example) in
rare cases. Only clerics of 36th level and with an
18 (or greater) Wisdom score may cast the wish
spell.
Wording the Wish: The player must say or
write the exact wish his character makes. The
wording is very important. The wish will usually
follow the literal wording, and whatever the in-
tentions of the cleric.
The DM should try to maintain game balance,
being neither too generous nor too stingy in de-
ciding the effects of a wish. Even a badly phrased
wish, made with good intentions, may have good
results. However, if the wish is greedy, or made
with malicious intent, the DM should make every
effort to distort the results of the spell so that the
caster does not profit from it. If necessary, the DM
can even disallow the wish; it would then have no
effect. Whenever a wish fails or is misinterpreted,
the DM should explain (after the game) the prob-
lem or flaw in the phrasing.
Here are some examples of faulty wishes:
"I wish that I knew everything about this
dungeon" could result in the character knowing
all for only a second, and then forgetting it.
"I wish for a million gold pieces" can be grant-
ed by having them land on the character (that's
100,000 pounds of gold!), and then vanish.
"I wish to immediately and permanently pos-
sess the gaze power of a basilisk while retaining
all of my own abilities and items" is a carefully
worded wish that's out of balance. Characters
able to use these high-level spells are already
quite powerful. This wish could result in the
character growing a basilisk head in addition to
the character's own head.
A wish cannot be used to gain either experi-
ence points or levels of experience.
Possible Effects: A properly worded wish can
substitute for any other magical spell of 8th level
or less, or any clerical or druidic spell of 6th level
or less, at the DM's discretion. This common use
of a wish is more likely to succeed with little
chance for error than other uses of the spell.
Otherwise, if the wish is used to harm another
creature, the victim may make a saving throw vs.
spells. If the save is successful, the victim takes
half the ill effects and the other half rebounds on
the caster (who may also save to avoid it, but
with a -4 penalty to the roll). If the wish will
inconvenience someone without harming him
(for example, by causing him to teleport into a
prison cell), the victim gets no saving throw.
A character can use a wish to gain treasure, up
to a maximum of 50,000 gold pieces per wish.
However, the caster loses 1 experience point per
gold piece value of treasure gained, and this loss
cannot be magically restored.
The cleric can use a wish to temporarily
change any one ability score to a minimum of 3
or maximum of 18. This effect lasts for only six
turns.
Wishes can also be used to permanently in-
crease ability scores, but the cost is very high:
You must cast as many wishes as the number of
the ability score desired. All the wishes must be
cast within a one-week period.
You may raise an ability score only one point
at a time. To raise your Strength from 15 to 16
takes 16 wishes. To then raise it to 17 will take an
additional 17 wishes. Wishes cannot perma-
nently lower ability scores.
A wish cannot raise the maximum experience
level for human characters; 36th level is an abso-
lute limit. However, one wish can allow demi-
humans to gain one additional Hit Die (for a
new maximum of 9 for halflings, 11 for elves,
and 13 for dwarves). This affects only hit points,
and does not change any other scores (such as at-
tack rolls, elves' number of spells, etc.).
A wish can change a demihuman to a human,
or the reverse. Such a change is permanent, and
the recipient does not become magical. Half-
lings and dwarves become fighters of the same
level. Elves become magic-users or fighters (but
not both), at the choice of the caster of the wish.
The changed character would then gain levels of
experience normally. A human changes to the
same level demihuman, but no higher than the
normal racial maximum.
If one character casts a wish to change an-
other's character class, the victim (at his option)
may make a saving throw vs. spells with a + 5
bonus to resist the change.
A wish can sometimes change the results of a
past occurrence. This is normally limited to
events of the previous day. A lost battle may be
won, or the losses may be made far less severe,
but impossible odds cannot be overcome com-
pletely. A death could be changed to a near-
death survival; a permanent loss could be made
temporary. The DM may wish to advise players
when their wishes exceed the limit of the spell's
power (or his patience).
Important Note: Whenever an effect is de-
scribed as being unchangeable "even with a
wish," that statement supersedes all others here.
Wishes can cause great problems if not han-
dled properly. The DM must see that wishes are
reasonably limited or the balance and enjoyment
of the game will be completely upset. The DM
should not allow wishes that alter the basics of
the game (such as a wish that dragons can't
breathe for damage). The more unreasonable
and greedy the wish is, the less likely that the
wish will become reality.
Wizardry
Range: 0 (cleric only)
Duration: One turn
Effect: Allows the use of one magic-user device
or scroll spell
The cleric using this spell gains the power to
use one item normally restricted to magic-users:
either a device (such as a wand) or a scroll con-
taining a 1st or 2nd level magic-user spell. (The
cleric cannot cast spells of 3rd or higher level,
even though they may be present on the scroll.)
This ability lasts for one turn, or until the scroll
or device is used.
The cleric magically gains knowledge of the
proper use of the item, as if the character were a
magic-user. For the duration and effect of the
magic-user spell, the caster is treated as the mini-
mum level necessary to cast the spell.
Druidic Spells
Druids can learn and cast any spell that a cleric
can—with the exception of spells that affect
alignments (such as protection from evil).
However, druids also have their own spells,
spells which clerics and magic-users cannot uti-
lize. The druid cannot cast more spells in a day
than a cleric, but he has the advantage of being
able to learn spells from two different sources,
his own list and the cleric's spell list.
Druidic spells tend to concern nature and the
natural order of life rather than combat or power
like many of the clerical and magical spells. Dru-
idic spells are also not reversible.
First Level Druidic Spells
Detect Danger
Range: 5' per level of the caster
Duration: One hour
Effect: Reveals hazards
This spell combines some effects of detect evil
and find traps. While it is functioning, the druid
can concentrate on places, objects, or creatures
within range. He needs a full round of concen-
tration to examine one square foot of area, one
creature, or one small object (a chest, weapon, or
smaller item). Larger objects require more time.
After he examines the thing, the druid will
know whether it is immediately dangerous, po-
tentially dangerous, or benign (all strictly from
the druid's point of view). Note that most crea-
tures are potentially dangerous. This spell will
detect poisons, while other spells may not.
The duration is a full hour when used in natu-
ral outdoor settings on the Prime Plane; else-
where, the duration is half normal (three turns).
Faerie Fire
Range: 60'
Duration: 1 round per level of caster
Effect: Illuminates creatures or objects
With this spell, the druid can outline one or
more creatures or objects with a pale, flickering,
greenish fire. The fire does not inflict any dam-
age. The objects or creatures need only be de-
tected in some way (such as by sight, or a detect
invisible spell) to be the object of this spell.
All attacks against the outlined creature or ob-
ject gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls. The druid
can outline one man-sized creature (about 12' of
fire) for each 5 levels of experience. Thus, at
20th level, 48' of fire can be produced (outlining
one dragon-sized creature, two horse-sized, or
four man-sized creatures).
Locate
Range: 0 (druid only)
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: Detects 1 animal or plant within 120'
This spell allows the druid to sense the direc-
tion of one known normal animal or plant. The
druid can locate (similar to the locate object
spell) any normal or giant-sized animal, but not
fantastic creatures, plant monsters, nor any in-
telligent creature or plant.
He must name the exact type of animal or
plant, but does not need to see the specific one
he wishes to locate. The animal or plant gets no
saving throw. (This spell is most often used to
find special rare plants.)
Predict Weather
Range: 0 (druid only)
Duration: 12 hours
Effect: Gives knowledge of coming weather
This spell enables the druid to learn the accu-
rate weather to come for the next 12 hours. It
affects an area 1 mile in diameter per level of the
druid; for example, a 20th level druid would
learn the weather within a 20 mile diameter (a
10 mile radius). The spell does not give the
druid any control over the weather; it merely
predicts what is to come.
Second Level Druidic Spells
Heat Metal
Range: 30'
Duration: 7 rounds
Effect: Warms one metal object
This spell causes one object to slowly heat and
then cool. It will affect one metal item weighing
up to one-half pound (5 cn) per level of the cast-
er. A 12th level druid, for example, can heat up
to 6 pounds (60 cn—a normal sword, for in-
stance), while a 20th level druid can heat 10
pounds (100 cn—for example, a two-handed
sword).
The heat causes no damage to magical items.
Normal weapons or other items may be severely
damaged, especially if made of both wood and
metal (as a normal lance), as the wood will burn
away at the point of contact with metal.
If the object is being held when heated, the
heat causes damage to the holder: 1 point of
damage during the first round, 2 points in the
second, 4 points in the third, 8 points in the
fourth, and then decreasing at the same rate (for
a total of 22 points of heat damage over seven
rounds). In the fourth round, the searing heat
will cause leather, wood, paper, and other flam-
mable objects in contact with the metal to catch
fire.
The holder gets no saving throw, but fire re-
sistance negates all damage. The character can
drop the item at any time, of course, and crea-
tures of low intelligence are 80% likely to do so
(check each round).
Once the spell has been cast, the druid no
longer needs to concentrate; the heating and
cooling proceed automatically. A dispel magic
can stop the effect, but normal means (immer-
sion in water, etc.) will not.
If the spell is used on an item imbedded in an
opponent (such as an arrow or dagger), the op-
ponent may remove the item but loses initiative
for that round (and takes the appropriate heat
damage for that round as well).
Heat damage disrupts concentration; the vic-
tim cannot cast spells during any round in which
he sustains damage from this spell.
Obscure
Range: 0 (druid only)
Duration: 1 turn per level of the caster
Effect: Creates a huge misty cloud
This spell causes a misty vapor to arise from
the ground around the druid, forming a huge
cloud. The cloud is 1' high per level of the druid,
and is 10' in diameter for each level. For exam-
ple, a 20th level druid could cast an obscure 20'
tall and 200' diameter (100' radius). The cloud
has no ill effects except to block vision.
The caster, and all creatures able to see invisi-
ble things, will be able to see dimly through the
cloud. All other creatures within the cloud will
be delayed and confused by the effect. While
within the cloud, these creatures are effectively
blind.
Produce Fire
Range: 0 (druid only)
Duration: 2 turns per level
Effect: Creates fire in hand
This spell causes a small flame to appear in the
druid's hand. It does not harm the caster in any
way, and sheds light as if a normal torch. The
flame can be used to ignite combustible materi-
als touched to it (a lantern, torch, oil, etc.) with-
out harming the magical flame. While holding
the flame, the caster can cause it to disappear
and reappear by concentration once per round,
until the duration ends. Other items may be
held and used in the hand while the fire is out. If
desired, the fire may be dropped or thrown to a
30' range, but disappears 1 round after leaving
the druid's hand. (Any fire it ignites during that
round remains burning.)
Warp Wood
Range: 240'
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Causes wooden weapons to bend
This spell causes one or more wooden weap-
ons to bend and (probably) become useless.
The spell will affect one arrow for each level of
the caster; treat a spear, javelin, or magical
wand as two arrows' worth, and any club, bow
or staff (magical or otherwise) as four. The spell
will not affect any wooden items other than
weapons. If a magical wooden item (such as
an enchanted staff) is the target, the wielder
may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the
effect. Items carried but not held get no saving
throw; magical items with "pluses" might not
be affected, at a 10% chance per "plus." (For
example, an arrow +1 would have a 10%
chance to be unaffected.)
Third Level Druidic Spells
Call Lightning
Range: 360'
Duration: 1 turn per level of the caster
Effect: Calls lightning bolts from a storm
This spell cannot be used unless a storm of
some (any) type is within range of the druid.
(This does not mean that he must be within the
spell's range of the storm cloud, but only that
the stormy weather be taking place within 360'
of him.)
If a storm is present, the druid may call 1
lightning bolt per turn (10 minutes) to strike at
any point within range. The lightning bolt de-
scends from the sky, hitting an area 20' across.
Each victim within that area takes 8d6 (8-48)
points of electrical damage, but may make a sav-
ing throw vs. spells to take half damage. The
druid need not call the lightning every turn un-
less desired; it remains available until the spell
duration (or the storm) ends.
Hold Animal
Range: 180'
Duration: 1 turn per level of the caster
Effect: Paralyzes several animals
This spell will affect any normal or giant-sized
animal, but will not affect any fantastic creature,
nor one of greater than animal intelligence (2).
Each victim must make a saving throw vs. spells
or be paralyzed for the duration of the spell.
The druid can affect 1 Hit Die of animals for
each level of experience, ignoring "pluses" to
Hit Dice. For example, a 20th level druid could
cast the spell at 10 giant toads (which have 2 + 2
Hit Dice each). Note that the spell can affect
summoned, conjured, or controlled animals.
Protection from Poison
Range: Touch
Duration: One turn per level of the caster
Effect: Gives one creature immunity to all poison
For the duration of this spell, the recipient is
completely immune to the effects of poisons of
all types, including gas traps and cloudkill spells.
This protection extends to items carried (thus
protecting against a spirit's poisonous presence,
for example). Furthermore, the recipient gains a
+ 4 bonus on saving throws vs. poisonous breath
weapons (such as green dragon breath), but not
petrification breath (such as a gorgon's).
Water Breathing
Range: 30'
Duration: 1 day
Effect: One air-breathing creature
This spell allows the recipient to breathe while
under water (at any depth). It does not affect
movement in any way, nor does it interfere with
the breathing of air.
Fourth Level Druidic Spells
Control Temperature 10' radius
Range: 0 (druid only)
Duration: 1 turn per level of the caster
Effect: Cools or warms air within 10'
This spell allows the druid to alter the temper-
ature within an area 20' across. The maximum
change is 50 degrees (Fahrenheit), either warmer
or cooler. The change occurs immediately, and
the effect moves with the druid. The druid may
change the temperature simply by concentrating
for 1 round, and the temperature will remain
changed as long as the spell lasts. The spell is
useful for resisting cold or heat so the caster may
survive temperature extremes.
Plant Door
Range: 0 (druid only)
Duration: 1 turn per level of the caster
Effect: Opens a path through growth
For the duration of this spell, no plants can
prevent the druid's passage, no matter how
dense. Even trees will bend or magically open to
allow the druid to pass. The druid can freely car-
ry equipment while moving through such barri-
ers, but no other creature can use the passage.
Note that a druid can hide inside a large tree
after casting this spell. The druid cannot see
what is happening while he is in the tree.
Protection from Lightning
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 turn per level of the caster
Effect: Protects against lightning attack
Any recipient of this spell is immune to a
given amount of electrical damage. The druid's
experience level determines the amount of dam-
age: for each level of experience, one die (1d6)
of damage is negated. Subtract the number of
dice from the number of dice of damage that
would be done to him.
Example: A 20th level druid casts this spell.
He is protected against 20d6 lightning damage.
For example, this would negate the effects of two
full call lightning attacks (of 8 dice each)on him,
plus half of a third (8 + 8 + 4 = 20). The third
call lightning inflicts 4d6 points of damage on
him (but he does get his saving throw against it),
and any subsequent call lightning attacks made
against him will do full damage.
Summon Animals
Range: 360'
Duration: 3 turns
Effect: Calls and befriends normal animals
With this spell, the druid can summon any or
all normal animals within range. Only normal,
nonmagical creatures of animal intelligence are
affected, including mammals, reptiles, amphib-
ians, etc. The spell does not affect insects, ar-
thropods, humans, and demihumans. The druid
may choose one or more known animals, may
call for specific types, or may summon every-
thing within range. The total Hit Dice of the an-
imals responding will equal the level of the
druid. Treat normal small creatures (frogs, mice,
squirrels, small birds, etc.) as 1/10 Hit Die each.
Animals affected will come at their fastest
movement rate, and will understand the druid's
speech while the spell is in effect. They will be-
friend and help the druid, to the limit of their
abilities. If harmed in any way, a summoned ani-
mal will normally flee, the spell broken for that
animal. However, if the druid is being attacked
when a summoned animal arrives, the animal
will immediately attack the opponent, fleeing
only if it fails a morale check.
This spell may also be used to calm hostile ani-
mals encountered while adventuring.
Fifth Level Druidic Spells
Anti-Plant Shell
Range: 0 (druid only)
Duration: 1 round per level of the druid
Effect: Personal barrier which blocks plants
This spell creates an invisible barrier around
the druid's body (less than an inch away). The
barrier stops all attacks by plants and plant-like
monsters, so that they can inflict no damage. If
the caster pushes through normal but dense
growth while protected, he will open a path that
others can pass through.
While protected, the druid cannot attack
plants except by spells; the plants are protected
from the druid's physical attacks, just as the
druid is protected from theirs.
Control Winds
Range: 10' radius per level of the caster
Duration: 1 turn per level of the caster
Effect: Calms or increases winds
With this spell, the druid can cause all the air
within range to behave as desired, either increas-
ing to gale force or slowing to a dead calm. The
druid must concentrate for one full turn of con-
centration (can't move or attack) to change the
wind completely (calm to gale, for example).
Any higher-level spellcaster using the same spell
can easily counter the spell. The effect moves
with the caster.
If the spell is cast against an air creature (such
as an elemental), the victim can make a saving
throw vs. spells. If the victim fails its roll, the
druid can slay or control the air creature by
proper use of the wind force. The creature will
only obey as long as the druid maintains concen-
tration and while the spell is active; if the druid's
concentration is broken or the spell's duration
lapses, the creature will attack the druid.
Dissolve
Range: 240'
Duration: 3-18 days
Effect: Liquefies 3,000 square feet
Nearly identical to the 5th level magic-user
spell of the same name, this effect changes a vol-
ume of soil or rock (but not a construction) to a
morass of mud. An area up to 10' deep or thick is
affected, and may have up to 3,000 square feet
of surface area. The druid may choose the exact
width and length (20' x 150', 30' x 100', etc.),
but the entire area of effect must be within 240'
of the caster. Creatures moving through the mud
are slowed to 10% of their normal movement
rate at best, and may become stuck (at the DM's
discretion, a victim must make saving throw vs.
spells to avoid becoming stuck).
Pass Plant
Range: 0 (druid only)
Duration: Instantaneous
Effect: Short-range teleportation
With this spell, the druid can enter one tree,
teleport, and immediately step out of another
tree of the same type. The trees must be large
enough to enclose the druid. The range a druid
can teleport varies by the type of tree, as follows.
600 yards
Oak
360 yards
Ash, Elm, Linden, Yew
240 yards
Evergreen trees
300 yards
Other trees
Sixth Level Druidic Spells
Anti-Animal Shell
Range: 0 (druid only)
Duration: 1 turn per level of the caster
Effect: Personal barrier that blocks animals
This spell creates an invisible barrier around
the druid's body (less than an inch away). The
barrier stops all attacks by animals, both normal
and giant-sized, as well as insects and all other
nonfantastic creatures of animal intelligence or
less (0-2). The druid cannot attack animals while
protected except by use of other spells; the ani-
mals are protected from the druid's physical at-
tacks, just as the druid is protected from theirs.
Summon Weather
Range: 5 miles or more
Duration: 6 turns per level
Effect: Brings weather to druid's area
When the druid casts this spell, some known
nearby weather condition is pulled to the druid's
location. The druid does not have control of the
weather, but merely summons it.
Only a druid of 25th level or greater may sum-
mon severe weather (hurricane, severe heat
wave, etc.). The range of summoning is 5 miles
at levels 12 to 15, adding 1 mile for each level of
the caster above 15th. (A 20th level druid could
summon weather from up to 10 miles away.)
Transport Through Plants
Range: Infinite
Duration: Instantaneous
Effect: Long-range teleportation
This spell may be used a maximum of once
per day. The druid must be near a plant (of any
size), and must choose either a general location
or a specific known plant elsewhere. After cast-
ing the spell, the druid magically enters the
nearby plant and steps out of a plant at the desti-
nation (if the druid could not specify the exact
plant, he appears from a plant determined ran-
domly by the DM). There is no limit to the
range, but the plants must both be living for the
spell to work, and must both be on the same
plane of existence. If either plant is dead, the
spell fails. Otherwise, the caster immediately re-
appears at the new location. The caster can trans-
port two additional willing creatures.
Turn Wood
Range: 30'
Duration: One turn per level of the druid
Effect: Pushes all wooden items away
This spell creates an invisible wave of force,
120' long and 60' tall. Its midpoint can be cre-
ated anywhere within 30' of the caster. This wave
of force then immediately moves in one horizon-
tal direction, as specified by the caster, at the
rate of 10' per round. If the druid desires, he can
stop the wave of force at any time, but cannot
thereafter move it again.
All wooden objects contacting or contacted by
the wave of force become stuck to it and move
with it. The wave of force continues moving un-
til it reaches the maximum range of 360 feet,
and stops there for the remainder of the spell du-
ration. The items caught are not harmed by the
effect, but wooden weapons (bows, crossbows,
most spears and javelins, etc.) and magical items
(wands, staves, etc.) cannot be used while
trapped in the effect.
Once created, the wave of force does not re-
quire concentration. However, the caster may
cause it to vanish before the duration ends by
concentrating for one round.
This spell has many useful applications during
mass combat (against a group of archers or siege
engines) and waterborne adventures (to move a
ship). It will move wooden objects which have
metal attachments (such as treasure chests).
However, it will not move permanent construc-
tions (such as buildings, including objects per-
manently attached to them such as doors) or
other secured objects (such as trees).
Seventh Level Druidic Spells
Creeping Doom
Range: 120'
Duration: 1 round per level of the caster
Effect: Creates a 20' x 20' insect horde
This spell magically creates a huge swarm of
1,000 creeping insects, appearing anywhere
within 120' of the druid (as chosen by the cast-
er). They fill an area at least 20' x 20', and can be
ordered to fill any area up to a maximum of
60' x 60'.
The creeping doom can move at up to 60'(20')
if the caster remains within 120' of any part of
the swarm. They vanish after the duration ends,
or whenever the druid is more than 120' away.
The insects always attack everyone and every-
thing in their path, inflicting 1 point of damage
per 10 insects, a total of 100 points per round to
each creature caught in the effect (no saving
throw). Normal attacks (such as fire) can damage
the horde slightly, but even a fireball spell will
only slay 100 of them (reducing the damage ac-
cordingly). The creeping doom can be destroyed
by a dispel magic spell (at normal chances for
success), but it can penetrate a protection from
evil effect, and can move over most obstacles at
the normal movement rate.
Metal to Wood
Range: 120'
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Changes metal into dead wood
This spell can be used to change any metal
item or items into wood. The spell can trans-
mute five pounds (50 cn weight) per level of the
caster. Any magical metal item is 90% resistant
to the magic. The effect is permanent, and the
affected metal cannot be changed back with a
dispel magic spell. Any armor changed to wood
falls off the wearer and any weapons affected
turn to nonmagical wooden clubs.
Summon Elemental
Range: 240'
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: Summons one 16 HD elemental
This spell allows the caster to summon any one
elemental per spell (see Chapter 14). The druid
may only summon one of each type of elemental
(air, earth, fire, water) in one day. The elemental
will understand the druid's spoken commands
and will perform any tasks within its power (car-
rying, attacking, etc.) as directed by the caster.
Unlike the magic-user's version of the spell,
the druid does not need to concentrate to control
the creature. The caster may send it back to its
own plane with a simple command, and some-
one else may send it back by the use of a dispel
magic or dispel evil spell.
Weather Control
Range: 0 (druid only)
Duration: Concentration
Effect: All weather within 240 yards
This spell allows the druid to create one spe-
cial weather condition in the surrounding area
(within a 240 yard radius). The caster may select
the weather condition. The spell only works out-
doors, and the weather will affect all creatures in
the area (including the caster). The effects last as
long as the caster concentrates, without moving;
if the caster is being moved (for example, aboard
a ship), the effect moves also. The spell's effects
vary, but the following results are typical:
Rain: -2 penalty to attack rolls applies to all
missile fire. After three turns, the ground be-
comes muddy, reducing movement to half the
normal rate.
Snow: Visibility (the distance a creature can
see) is reduced to 20'; movement is reduced to
half the normal rate. Rivers and streams may
freeze over. Mud remains after the snow thaws,
for the same movement penalty.
Fog: 20' visibility, half normal movement.
Those within the fog might become lost, moving
in the wrong direction.
Clear: This cancels bad weather (rain, snow,
fog) but not secondary effects (such as mud).
Intense Heat: Movement reduced to half nor-
mal. Excess water (from rain, snow, mud trans-
muted from rock, etc.) dries up.
High Winds: No missile fire or flying is possi-
ble. Movement reduced to half normal. At sea,
ships sailing with the wind move 50% faster. In
the desert, high winds create a sandstorm, for
half normal movement and 20' visibility.
Tornado: This creates a whirlwind under the
druid control, attacking and moving as if it was a
12 HD air elemental. At sea, treat the tornado as
a storm or gale.
Magical Spells
Casting Magical Spells
Spells used by magic-users and elves are some-
what different from those used by clerics and
druids, both in their effects and the ways they
are learned and used.
Spell Books
When a magic-user or elf begins play at first
level, he starts with a spell book, given to him by
his teacher. The spell book will contain two 1st
level spells. The Dungeon Master will tell you
what spells your character starts with.
The spell book is large and bulky, and cannot
be easily carried (about 2' square, 2-6 inches
thick, weighing at least 20 pounds). It will not
fit inside a normal sack of any size, but may be
carried in a backpack or saddlebag. All spell
books are written in magical words, and only
their owners may read them without using the
read magic spell (described later).
As previously discussed, the magic-user or elf
forgets each spell as he casts it. This is why he has
a spell book: He can memorize the spell again
later and have it available to him once more.
On the magic-user and elf experience tables,
the "Spells/Level" columns indicate how many
spells of each level the character can have memo-
rized at one time. This doesn't limit the number
of spells the character can have in his spell books.
For example, a fourth level magic-user can
memorize four spells—two 1st level and two 2nd
level. But his spell book might have more spells
written in it. He might have six 1st level spells
written in his book, for instance, and he might
have three 2nd level spells. He can still only
memorize two of each type in a day.
Learning New Spells
Every magic-user and elf was taught magic by
someone else—normally, by a nonplayer character spellcaster of 7th experience level or higher.
Your campaign can assume that magic-user
and elf characters have such a teacher, whom
they visit and learn from whenever they're not
adventuring. The DM may wish to work this
NPC into a full-fledged character who can ap-
pear in adventures as a consultant or expert.
The PCs' teacher does not go on adventures—
not until the characters reach or exceed his expe-
rience level, and only then if the DM wishes him
to. Otherwise, the player characters would have
a very powerful ally along, one who would solve
most of their adventuring problems.
When the player character begins play, the
teacher gives him a spell book with two 1st level
spells in it. When the PC reaches 2nd level, the
teacher writes another 1st level spell in the book.
When the PC reaches 3rd level, the teacher will
write a 2nd level spell in his book, and when he
reaches 4th level the teacher will give him one
more 2nd level spell.
In many campaigns, that's the point at which
the teacher stops instructing the character. The
character has gone from apprentice to journey-
man, and now he must journey in order to learn
more of magic.
So, where can PCs learn more spells? They
have several options, and may explore any or all
of them during their careers.
Other Magic-Users: By ancient tradition—of
necessity and common sense—magic-users are
loathe to trade spells among themselves. Each
magic-user knows that he may become a very
powerful wizard some day . . . and that he may
end up being the enemy of another wizard of
similar power. No wizard wants to teach the oth-
er fellow magic that can kill him. This is some-
thing the DM should reinforce in his campaign:
If he finds characters casually trading spells from
their spell books, he should remind them of the
traditions of secrecy, of the good reasons for that
tradition, of the paranoia that infects the magic-
users' community, and so on. If they decline to
accept his recommendation, their characters may
pick up a reputation—as magic-users who can't
keep their trade secret. Other spellcasters, per-
haps even their old teachers, will refuse to teach
them and will take special pains to keep their
magic hidden from them. Higher-level magic-
users may even decide to steal or destroy the PCs'
spell books to teach them a lesson—forcing them
to work for many boring weeks or months to re-
construct them (see "Lost Spell Books," below).
But that's casual exchanges of spells. It's
known for magic-users to give spells to PCs in
more remarkable circumstances. For instance,
low-level spellcasters might do a great favor for a
high-level magician (save his child, undertake a
special quest for him and demonstrate remark-
able bravery while carrying it out, etc.). In such a
case, it is not necessarily inappropriate for the
NPC to reward the PC with a spell.
The Teacher: Once the player character reach-
es 4th experience level, his teacher doesn't have
to leave play entirely. The PC might be able to
visit and train with him from time to time, and
the teacher could continue to teach him spells.
But since the PC is a journeyman now, the teach-
er might also require him to undertake specific
tasks ("Now, I need you to take this flask to Es-
devius in far-off Parokaland . . . and don't let
the dragon get you.") in order to remain his stu-
dent. While the PC could continue learning
spells this way, the teacher should not be his only
source for new spells; he should be learning oth-
ers as he adventures.
Scrolls: One magical treasure sometimes
found in adventures is the magical scroll. Some
scrolls have magic-user spells written upon
them. A magic-user can use the scroll by casting
the spell from it—in which case the written spell
disappears as soon as it is cast. Or, he can transfer
it to his spell book (during this process, the spell
disappears from the scroll), and he will have
gained a new spell.
Enemy Magic-Users: Should the PCs encount-
er and defeat an enemy magic-user, the PC
magic-user might try to help himself to the ene-
my's spell book. The DM should make sure that
the spell book has many spells which are identi-
cal to those in the PC's spell book: Most magic-
users have many spells in common, especially the
lower-level spells. The PC should gain only one
or two new spells out of such an encounter. A
new spell is a rare find, and a spell book is an
even rarer treasure; the books are always well
hidden and protected. PCs using someone else's
spell book may find magical traps and curses
within before they find any new spells.
Higher-level Spells
A magic-user cannot put into his spell book a
spell of a higher-level than he can cast. In other
words, if he can't yet cast a 3rd level spell, he
certainly can't write one in his spell book.
Lost Spell Books
A magic-user or elf whose spell book is lost or
destroyed cannot regain spells until he replaces
the spell book. He can't just read from some-
body else's spell book. He can recreate the spells
from memory and research . . . but it takes a lot
of money and a lot of time.
The method, amount of time, and cost it
takes to recreate a spell book are for the DM to
decide. Here's a rough guideline: 1,000 gold
pieces and one week of study for each spell level
replaced. (For example, each 3rd level spell
would require 3,000 gp and three weeks to re-
construct). This reconstruction takes up all the
character's time, leaving none for adventuring.
A character can make a second spell book to
leave in a safe place in case his primary book is
destroyed. This doesn't take all the time and
money which reconstruction of spells requires; a
magic-user or elf could copy four spells a day
from his primary spell book to his "backup."
The Player Character's Spell Book
Both the player and the DM need to keep
track of exactly which spells are in a character's
spell book. Both people can keep track of which
spells the character has had access to; the player
can keep track of the ones the character acquires.
If ever there's a difference in the two spell lists,
the player should be able to remember where the
character acquired the extra spells; if the expla-
nation doesn't satisfy the DM, he's may remove
the spell from the character's spell book. Appen-
dix 3 provides a copyable spell book sheet, on
which players can keep the name and description
of all their characters' spells.
Reversible Spells
Unlike clerical spells, magical spells must be
memorized in their reversed form to be usable in
that form. The spellcaster must select the normal
or reversed form of the spell when he memorizes
the spell for the day. There's no problem to
memorizing a spell in reversed form; if the spell
can be reversed, the magic-user knows how to
memorize it that way.
Of course, a magic-user could memorize it
once in normal form and once in reversed form.
For example, if a spellcaster has a light spell in a
spell book, the character could memorize both
light and darkness for an adventure.
In the spell lists below, all spells which can be
reversed are marked with an asterisk (*).
First Level Magical Spells
Analyze
Range: 0 (touch only)
Duration: 1 round
Effect: Analyzes magic on one item
A spellcaster using this spell can handle one
item and learn the enchantment on it. Helms
must be put on the spellcaster's head, swords
held in his hand, bracelets put on his wrist, etc.
for this spell to work. Any consequences of this
action (for example, from cursed or booby-
trapped objects) fall upon the spellcaster,
though he gets his usual saving throws.
The spellcaster has a chance of 15% plus 5%
per experience level to determine one magical
characteristic of the item; if the item is non-
magical, his chance is to determine that fact.
The spell does not reveal much precise infor-
mation. It will characterize a weapon's pluses
(attack bonus) as "many" or "few," will esti-
mate the number of charges on an item within
25% of the actual number, etc.
Charm Person
Range: 120'
Duration: See below
Effect: One living person (see below)
This spell will only affect humans, demi-
humans, and certain other creatures. The victim
is allowed a saving throw vs. spells. If the saving
throw is successful, the spell has no effect. If it
fails, the victim will believe that the spellcaster is
its "best friend," and will try to defend the spell-
caster against any threat, whether real or imag-
ined. The victim is charmed.
As a general rule, the spell only affects crea-
tures which look similar to humans in various
ways—humans, demihumans, certain giant-
class creatures, etc. It will not affect animals,
magical creatures (such as living statues), un-
dead monsters, or human-like creatures larger
than ogres.
If the spellcaster can speak a language that the
charmed victim understands, the spellcaster may
give orders to the victim. These orders should
sound like suggestions, as if "just between
friends." The charmed victim will usually obey,
but the victim may resist orders that are contrary
to the victim's nature (alignment and habits)—
he doesn't need to roll anything to resist. A vic-
tim will refuse to obey if ordered to kill itself.
A charm may last for months. The victim may
make another saving throw every so often, de-
pending on its Intelligence score.
Charm Person Duration
If the Victim Has:
He Saves Every:
High Intelligence (13-18):
1 day
Average Intelligence (9-12):
1 week
Low Intelligence (3-8):
1 month
A more complex system for determining the
duration of a charm spell appears in Chapter 13,
on page 144.
A victim who is given conflicting orders and
impressions by his old adventuring friends and
his new "best friend" should react as any person
would in real life: with confusion. He will not
automatically assume that one party or the other
is lying . . . even if the player wants him to.
The charm is automatically broken if the spell-
caster attacks the victim, whether by spell or by
weapon. The victim will fight normally if at-
tacked by the spellcaster's allies.
Detect Magic
Range: 0
Duration: 2 turns
Effect: Everything within 60'
When he casts this spell, the spellcaster will
see a glow surround all magical objects, crea-
tures, and places which are visible and within
range of the spell. No saving throw is allowed.
Example: Shortly after casting this spell, a
magic-user walks into a room containing a door
locked by magic, a magical potion lying nearby,
and a treasure chest containing a magical wand.
All the magic will glow, but the spellcaster can
see only the door and potion; the light of the
glowing wand is hidden by the treasure chest.
Floating Disc
Range: 0
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: Disc remains within 6'
This spell creates an invisible magical horizon-
tal platform about the size and shape of a small
round shield. It can carry up to 5000 cn (500
pounds). It cannot be created in a place occupied
by a creature or object. The floating disc is cre-
ated at the height of the spellcaster's waist, and
will always remain at that height. It will auto-
matically follow the spellcaster at his current
movement rate, remaining within 6' of him at
all times. It can never be used as a weapon, be-
cause it has no solid existence and veers away
from anything it might run into. When the du-
ration ends, the floating disc will disappear, sud-
denly dropping anything upon it. No saving
throw is allowed.
Hold Portal
Range: 10'
Duration: 2-12 (2d6) turns
Effect: One door, gate, or similar portal
This spell will magically hold shut any
portal—for example, a door or gate. A knock
spell will open the hold portal. Any creature
three or more Hit Dice greater than the caster
(and characters three or more levels higher) may
break open a held portal in one round, but the
portal will relock if allowed to close within the
duration of the spell.
Example: Any 5th level character can break
through a hold portal spell cast by a 2nd level
spellcaster.
Light*
Range: 120'
Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn/level of the caster
Effect: Volume of 30' diameter
This spell creates a large ball of light, much
like a bright torchlight. If the spell is cast on an
object (such as a coin), the light will move with
the object. If cast at a creature's eyes, the crea-
ture must make a saving throw vs. spells. If he
fails the saving throw, the victim will be blinded
by the light until the duration ends (see page
150, for the effects of blindness). If he makes the
saving throw, the light appears in the air behind
the intended victim.
When reversed, this spell, darkness, creates a
circle of darkness 30' in diameter. It will block all
sight except infravision. Darkness will cancel a
light spell if cast upon it (but may itself be can-
celed by another light spell). If cast at an oppo-
nent's eyes, it will cause blindness until
canceled, or until the duration ends; as before,
the victim does get a saving throw.
Magic Missile
Range: 150'
Duration: 1 round
Effect: Creates 1 or more arrows
A magic missile is a glowing arrow, created
and shot by magic, which inflicts 1d6 + 1 (2-7)
points of damage to any creature it strikes. After
the spell is cast, the arrow appears next to the
spellcaster and hovers there (moving with him)
until the spellcaster causes it to shoot. When
shot, the magic missile will automatically hit any
one visible target the spellcaster specifies. The
magic missile actually has no solid form, and
cannot be touched. A magic missile never misses
its target and the target is not allowed a saving
throw.
For every 5 levels of experience of the caster,
two more missiles are created by the same spell.
Thus a 6th level spellcaster may create three mis-
siles. The spellcaster may shoot the missiles all at
one target or at different targets.
Protection from Evil
Range: 0
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: The spellcaster only
This spell creates an invisible magical barrier
all around the spellcaster's body (less than an
inch away). All attacks against the spellcaster are
penalized by — 1 to their attack rolls, and the
spellcaster gains a +1 bonus to all saving throws,
while the spell lasts.
In addition, enchanted creatures cannot at-
tack the spellcaster in hand-to-hand or melee
combat. (An enchanted creature is one that nor-
mal weapons cannot hurt; only magical weapons
can hit the creature. A creature that can be only
hit by a silver weapon—a werewolf, for
example—is not an enchanted creature. Any
creature that is magically summoned or con-
trolled, such as a charmed character, is also con-
sidered to be an enchanted creature.)
The barrier thus completely prevents all at-
tacks from those creatures unless they use missile
weapons; the barrier is no defense against mis-
siles, though the attackers still suffer the — 1 at-
tack roll penalties.
This spell will not affect a magic missile, ei-
ther incoming or outgoing. If the spellcaster at-
tacks (hand-to-hand) anything during the spell's
duration, the effect changes slightly. Enchanted
creatures are then able to touch the spellcaster,
but the attack roll and saving throw adjustments
still apply until the spell duration ends.
Read Languages
Range: 0
Duration: 2 turns
Effect: The spellcaster only
This spell will allow the spellcaster to read, not
speak, any unknown languages or codes, includ-
ing treasure maps, secret symbols, and so forth,
until the duration ends.
Read Magic
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Effect: The spellcaster only
This spell will allow the spellcaster to read, not
speak, any magical words or runes, such as those
found on scrolls and other items. A spellcaster
cannot understand unfamiliar magic writings
without using this spell. However, once a spell-
caster reads a scroll or runes with this spell, he
can read or speak that magic later without using
a spell.
All spell books are written in magical words,
and only their owners may read them without
using this spell.
Shield
Range: 0
Duration: 2 turns
Effect: The spellcaster only
This spell creates a magical barrier all around
the spellcaster (less than an inch away). It moves
with the spellcaster. While the duration lasts,
the spellcaster has an AC of 2 against missiles,
and AC 4 against all other attacks.
If someone shoots a magic missile at a spell-
caster protected by this spell, the spellcaster may
make a saving throw vs. spells (one saving throw
per missile). If the saving throw is successful, the
magic missile has no effect; it hits the barrier and
evaporates.
Sleep
Range: 240'
Duration: 4d4 (4-16) turns
Effect: 2-16 Hit Dice of living creatures within a
40' square area
This spell will put creatures to sleep for up to
16 turns. It will only affect creatures with 4 + 1
Hit Dice or less—generally, small or man-sized
creatures. The spell will not affect creatures out-
side the 40' X 40' area which the player chooses
as the spell's target area. The spell will not work
against undead or very large creatures, such as
dragons.
When a character is first hit with a sleep spell,
falling or sagging to the ground will not wake
him up. However, characters affected by a sleep
spell are not in a deep sleep. Any sleeping char-
acter or creature will awaken if slapped, kicked,
or shaken.
Characters can kill a sleeping victim with a sin-
gle blow of any edged weapon, regardless of the
creature's hit points.
Your Dungeon Master will roll 2d8 to find the
total Hit Dice or experience levels of monsters af-
fected by the spell.
The victims get no saving throw against this
spell.
Ventriloquism
Range: 60'
Duration: 2 turns
Effect: One item or location
This spell will allow the spellcaster to make
the sound of his or her voice come from some-
where else, such as a statue, animal, a dark cor-
ner, and so forth. The "somewhere else" must
be within range of the spell.
Second Level Magical Spells
Continual Light*
Range: 120'
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Volume of 60' diameter
This spell creates a globe of light 60' across. It
is much brighter than a torch, but not as bright
as full daylight. It will continue to glow forever,
or until it is magically removed. It may be cast on
an object, just as the first level light spell. If cast
at a creature's eyes, the victim must make a sav-
ing throw vs. spells. If he fails the saving throw,
the victim is blinded—permanently, or until the
spell is dispelled. If he makes the saving throw,
the globe will still appear, but will remain in the
place it was cast, and the intended victim will
suffer no ill effects.
The reverse of this spell, continual darkness,
creates a volume of complete darkness in a 30'
radius. Torches, lanterns, and even a light spell
will not affect it, and infravision cannot pene-
trate it. If cast on a creature's eyes, the creature
must make a saving throw vs. spells or be blind-
ed until the spell is removed. A continual light
spell will cancel its effects.
Detect Evil
Range: 60'
Duration: 2 turns
Effect: Everything within 60'
When this spell is cast, the spellcaster will see
a glow surround all evilly-enchanted objects
within 60'. It will also cause creatures that want
to harm the spellcaster to glow when they are
within range. The spell, however, does not allow
the spellcaster to hear the actual thoughts of the
creatures.
Remember that Chaotic alignment is not au-
tomatically the same as evil, although many
Chaotic monsters have evil intentions. Traps and
poison are neither good nor evil, but merely
dangerous.
Detect Invisible
Range: 10' per level of the spellcaster
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: The spellcaster only
When this spell is cast, the spellcaster can see
all invisible creatures and objects within range.
The range is 10' for each level of the spellcaster.
For example, a 3rd level spellcaster can use this
spell to see invisible things within 30'.
Entangle
Range: 30'
Duration: 1 round per level
Effect: Controls ropes
This spell allows the spellcaster to use any
rope-like object of living or once-living material
(roots, vines, leather ropes, plant-fibre ropes,
etc.) to behave as he or she orders. About 50' of
normal 1/2" diameter vine plus 5' per level of the
caster can be affected.
The commands which can be given during an
entangle spell include: coil (form a neat stack),
coil and knot, loop, loop and knot, tie and knot,
and the reverses of all the above. The vine or
rope must be within 1' of any object it is to coil
around or tie up, so it must often be thrown at
the target. This spell is very useful in climbing
situations; a spellcaster can toss a rope up the
side of a wall or cliff and command it to loop and
knot itself around a projection at the height of
the throw. Coil and knot effectively ties up a vic-
tim.
A person or monster attacked by any use of
the spell may make a saving throw vs. spells to
avoid the effects of the entangle.
ESP*
Range: 60'
Duration: 12 turns
Effect: All thoughts in one direction
This spell will allow the spellcaster to "hear"
thoughts. The spellcaster must concentrate in
one direction for six rounds (one minute) to hear
the thoughts (if any) of a creature within range.
The spell allows the spellcaster to understand the
thoughts of any single living creature, regardless
of the language. The spell does not allow the
caster to hear the thoughts of undead creatures.
If more than one creature is within range and
in the direction the caster is concentrating, the
spellcaster will "hear" a confused jumble of
thoughts. The spellcaster can sort out the jumble
only by concentrating for an extra six rounds to
find a single creature.
ESP will not be hampered by any amount of
wood or liquid, and will penetrate as much as
two feet of rock, but a thin coating of lead will
block the spell. Targets can make a saving throw
vs. spell to avoid the spell effects.
The reverse of this spell, mindmask, may be
cast, by touch, on any one creature. The recipi-
ent is completely immune to ESP and all other
forms of mind-reading for the spell duration.
Invisibility
Range: 240'
Duration: Permanent until broken
Effect: One creature or object
This spell will make any one creature or object
invisible. When a creature becomes invisible, all
items that he carries and wears also become invis-
ible. Any invisible item becomes visible again
when it leaves the creature's possession
(dropped, set down, etc.). A light source (such
as a torch) may be made invisible, but the light
given off will always remain visible.
If the spellcaster makes an object invisible that
is not being carried or worn, it will become visi-
ble again when touched by any living creature.
An invisible creature will remain invisible until
he or she attacks or casts any spell.
Knock
Range: 60'
Duration: See below
Effect: One lock or bar
This spell will open any type of lock. This spell
will open any normal or magically locked door
(one affected by a hold portal or wizard lock
spell), and any secret door (but a secret door
must be found before it can be knocked open).
Any locking magic will remain, however, and
will take effect once again when the door is
closed. This spell will also unlock a gate, or un-
stick it if it is stuck, and will cause any treasure
chest to open easily. It will also cause a barred
door to open, magically forcing the bar to fall to
the floor. If a door is locked and barred, only one
type of lock will be opened.
Levitate
Range: 0
Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn/level of the caster
Effect: The spellcaster only
When this spell is cast, the spellcaster may
move up or down in the air without any support.
This spell does not, however, allow the spellcast-
er to move from side to side. For example, a
spellcaster could levitate to a ceiling, and then
could slowly move sideways by pushing and pull-
ing. His movement up or down is at the rate of
20' per round.
The spell cannot be cast on another person or
object. The spellcaster may carry a normal
amount of weight while levitating, up to 2,000
cn (200 lbs) in weight, possibly another man-
sized creature (if it isn't wearing metal armor).
Any creature smaller than man-sized can be car-
ried, unless heavily laden. No saving throw is al-
lowed.
Locate Object
Range: 60' + 10' per level of the spellcaster
Duration: 2 turns
Effect: One object within range
The spellcaster casts this spell to find an object
within the spell's range. For this spell to work,
the spellcaster must know exactly what the ob-
ject looks like. He can specify a common type of
object, such as "any flight of stairs," instead.
The spell will point to the nearest designated
object within range, giving the direction but not
the distance.
The spell's range increases as the spellcaster
gains levels of experience. For example, a 2nd
level spellcaster can locate objects up to 80'
away; a 3rd level spellcaster, up to 90'.
Mirror Image
Range: 0
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: The spellcaster only
With this spell, the spellcaster creates 1d4 (1-
4) additional images which look and act exactly
like him. The images appear and remain next to
(within 3' of) the spellcaster, moving if the spell-
caster moves, talking if the spellcaster talks, and
so forth. The spellcaster need not concentrate;
the images will remain until the duration ends,
or until they are hit.
The images are not real, and cannot actually
do anything. Any successful attack on the spell-
caster will strike an image instead, which will
merely cause that image to disappear (regardless
of the actual damage); this continues until all
the images are dispelled. (If the spellcaster is
caught in the effect of an area-type attack, such
as a fireball spell, all images will disappear and
the spellcaster will be affected by the spell.)
Phantasmal Force
Range: 240'
Duration: Concentration (see below)
Effect: A volume 20' x 20' x 20'
This spell creates or changes appearances of
everything within the area affected. The spell-
caster can create the illusion of something he or
she has seen. If not, the DM will give a bonus to
the saving throws of those trying to ignore the
spell's effects. If the spellcaster does not use this
spell to attack, the illusion created by this spell
will disappear when touched.
If the spellcaster uses the spell to create the il-
lusion of a monster, it will appear in every way to
be the monster in question. However, the mon-
ster is AC 9 and will disappear when hit.
If the spellcaster uses the spell to create an at-
tack (a phantasmal magic missile, collapsing
wall, etc.), the victim may make a saving throw
vs. spells; if he is successful, the victim is not af-
fected, and realizes that the attack is an illusion.
The phantasmal force will remain as long as
the spellcaster concentrates. If the spellcaster
moves, takes any damage, or fails any saving
throw, his concentration is broken and the phan-
tasm disappears.
This spell never inflicts any real damage.
Those "killed" by it will merely fall uncon-
scious, those "turned to stone" will be para-
lyzed, and so forth. The effects wear off in 1d4
turns. If the character does make his saving
throw to realize that the attack is an illusion, the
damage sustained disappears immediately.
Web
Range: 10'
Duration: 48 turns
Effect: A volume 10' x 10' x 10'
This spell creates a mass of sticky strands
which are difficult to destroy except with flame.
It usually blocks the area affected. Giants and
other creatures with great strength can break
through a web in 2 rounds. A human of Average
Strength (a score of 9-12) will take 2d4 (2-8)
turns to break through the web. Flames (from a
torch, for example) will destroy the web in 2
rounds, but all creatures within the web will be
burned for 1-6 (1d6) points of damage. Anyone
wearing gauntlets of ogre power (a magical trea-
sure) can break free of a web in 4 rounds.
Wizard Lock
Range: 10'
Duration: Permanent
Effect: One portal or lock
This spell is a more powerful version of a hold
portal spell. It will work on any lock, not merely
doors, and will last forever (or until magically
dispelled). However, a knock spell can open the
wizard lock.
The wizard who cast the wizard lock can easily
open the door he has enchanted, as can any
magic-using character or creature of three or
more levels (or Hit Dice) greater than the caster.
This sort of door-opening does not remove the
magic, and the magical lock will relock when al-
lowed to close (just as with the hold portal spell).
Third Level Magical Spells
Clairvoyance
Range: 60'
Duration: 12 turns
Effect: See through another's eyes
With this spell, the caster may see through the
eyes of any single creature in spell range.
"Seeing" through a creature's eyes takes one
full turn, after which the caster can change to an-
other creature, even one in another direction; he
does not have to cast the spell again to do so. Two
feet of rock or a thin coating of lead blocks the
effects of this spell. No saving throw is allowed.
Create Air
Range: Immediate area, 8,000 cu. ft.
Duration: 1 hour per level of caster
Effect: Provides breathable air
This spell provides breathable air, especially in
areas where otherwise there is none to be had. It
is cast on a volume of 8,000 cubic feet (such as a
20' x 20' x 20' room) and, while it is in effect,
everyone in that area has good air to breathe.
Customarily, it's used when dungeon explor-
ers are trapped where air is running out. When
cast in this fashion, the spell effect stays in one
place; it does not move with the caster.
However, it does not have to be cast in only
that way; it can be cast on enclosed vehicle inte-
riors (such as the below-deck areas of ships), liv-
ing creatures, or pieces of equipment. When it is
so cast, it will provide pressurized air for the du-
ration of the spell effect, and the spell will travel
with the vehicle on which it is cast.
The spell may be cast upon one person,
whereupon he can breathe normally. It's not the
same as water breathing, though—if he dives
underwater, he can still breathe, but great quan-
tities of air are always bubbling up from him,
making stealthy travel an impossibility.
The spell may be cast upon a specific piece of
equipment like a helmet, and whichever one
person wears it may breathe normally. If the hel-
met is not fully enclosed (i.e., airtight), air will
leak out from it under pressure; underwater this
makes stealthy movement impossible.
A flying creature on which this spell is cast can
not only breathe in hostile environments, it can
fly through airless void. This means that a
pegasus-rider could cast one spell on himself and
one on his pegasus, and then the two of them
could fly into the ether of outer space.
The spell does not protect people from the ef-
fects of poison gasses unless the gas in question is
a normal component of the atmosphere.
Dispel Magic
Range: 120'
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Destroys spells in a 20' cube
This spell destroys other spell effects in a cubic
volume of 20' x 20' x 20'. It does not affect mag-
ical items. Spell effects created by a caster
(whether cleric, druid, magic-user, or elf) of a
level equal to or lower than the spellcaster of the
dispel magic are automatically and immediately
destroyed. Spell effects created by a higher-level
spellcaster might not be affected. The chance of
failure is 5% per level of difference between the
spellcasters. For example, a 7th level magic-user
trying to dispel a web spell cast by a 9th level
cleric would have a 10% chance of failure.
Dispel magic will not affect a magical item
(such as a scroll, a magical sword, etc.). How-
ever, it can dispel the effects of the magical item
when that item is used (a spellcaster can cast dis-
pel magic on the victim of a ring of human con-
trol and snap him out of that control).
Fireball
Range: 240'
Duration: Instantaneous
Effect: Explosion in a sphere 40' diameter
This spell creates a missile of fire that bursts
into a ball of fire with a 40' diameter (20' radius)
where it strikes a target. The fireball will cause
1d6 points of fire damage per level of the caster
to every creature in the area of effect.
Each victim may make a saving throw vs.
spells; if successful, the spell will only do half
damage. For example, a fireball cast by a 6th
level spellcaster will burst for 6d6 (6-36) points
of damage; characters who make their saving
throw vs. spell will take only half of the damage
rolled on the dice.
Fly
Range: Touch
Duration: 1d6 (1-6) turns + 1 turn per level of
the caster
Effect: One creature may fly
This spell allows the target it is cast upon (pos-
sibly the spellcaster himself) to fly. The recipient
can fly in any direction and at any speed up to
360' (120') by mere concentration. The recipient
may also stop and hover at any point (as a levi-
tate spell); this does not require concentration.
Haste*
Range: 240'
Duration: 3 turns
Effect: Up to 24 creatures move double speed
This spell allows up to 24 creatures in a 60' di-
ameter circle to perform actions at double speed
for half an hour (3 turns). Those affected may
move at up to twice normal speed and make
double the normal number of missile or hand-
to-hand attacks.
This spell does not affect the rate at which
magic works, so a hasted spellcaster can still not
cast more than one spell per round, and the use
of magical devices (such as wands) cannot be
speeded up.
The reverse of this spell, slow, will remove the
effects of a haste spell, or will cause the victims to
move and attack at half normal speed.
As with haste, the slow spell does not affect
spellcasting or the use of magical devices.
The victims may make a saving throw vs. spells
to avoid the effect.
Hold Person*
Range: 120'
Duration: 1 turn/level
Effect: Paralyzes up to 4 creatures
The hold person spell will affect any human,
demihuman, or human-like creature (bugbear,
dryad, gnoll, hobgoblin, kobold, lizard man,
ogre, orc, nixie, pixie or sprite, for instance). It
will not affect the undead or creatures larger
than ogres.
Each victim must make a saving throw vs.
spells or be paralyzed for nine turns. The spell
may be cast at a single person or at a group. If
cast at a single person, the victim suffers a — 2
penalty to the saving throw. If cast at a group, it
will affect up to four persons (of the cleric's
choice), but with no penalty to their rolls. The
paralysis may only be removed by the reversed
form of the spell, or by a dispel magic spell.
The reverse of the spell, free person, removes
the paralysis of up to four victims of the normal
form of the spell (including hold person cast by a
cleric). It has no other effect; e.g., it does not
remove the effects of a ghoul's paralysis ability.
Infravision
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 day
Effect: One living creature
This spell enables the recipient to see in the
dark, to a 60' range, with the same sort of vision
possessed by dwarves and elves.
Infravision is the ability to see heat (and the
lack of heat). Dwarves, elves, and casters of the
infravision spell have infravision in addition to
normal sight and can see 60' in the dark. Infra-
vision does not work in normal and magical
light. Fire and other heat sources can interfere
with infravision, just as a bright flash of light can
make normal vision go black for a short time.
With infravision, warm things appear red,
and cold things appear blue. For example, an
approaching creature could be seen as a red
shape, leaving faint reddish footprints. A cold
pool of water would seem a deep blue color.
Characters with infravision can even see items or
creatures which are the same temperature as the
surrounding air (such as a table or a skeleton), since
air flow will inevitably show the viewer their bor-
ders, outlining them in a faint lighter-blue tone.
Until they move, they will be very faint to the eye;
once they start moving, they become blurry but
very obvious light-blue figures.
Infravision isn't good enough to read by. A
character can use his infravision to recognize an
individual only if they are within 10' distance
unless the individual is very, very distinctive (for
example, 8' tall or walking with a crutch).
Invisibility 10' radius
Range: 120'
Duration: Permanent until broken
Effect: All creatures within 10'
This spell makes the recipient (and all others
within 10' at the time of the casting) invisible.
This is an area effect, and those who move fur-
ther than 10' from the recipient become visible.
They may not regain invisibility by returning to
the area. Otherwise, the invisibility is the same
as that bestowed by the spell invisibility. An in-
visible creature will remain invisible until he or
she attacks or casts any spell.
All items carried (whether by the recipient or
others within 10') also become invisible.
Lightning Bolt
Range: 180'
Duration: Instantaneous
Effect: Bolt 60' long, 5' wide
This spell creates a bolt of lightning, starting
up to 180' away from the caster and extending
60' in a straight line further away. All creatures
within the area of effect take 1d6 points of dam-
age per level of the spellcaster. (Thus a 6th level
elf would cast a lightning bolt doing 6d6 points
of damage.)
Each victim may make a saving throw vs.
spells; if successful, he takes only half damage.
If the lightning bolt strikes a solid surface
(such as a wall), it will bounce back toward the
caster until the total length of the bolt is 60'.
Protection from Evil 10' Radius
Range: 0
Duration: 12 turns
Effect: Barrier 20' diameter
This spell creates an invisible magical barrier
all around the caster, extending for a 10' radius
in all directions. The spell serves as protection
from attacks by monsters of an alignment other
than the caster's. Each creature within the barri-
er gains a +1 to all saving throws, and all attacks
against those within are penalized by - 1 to the
attacker's attack roll while the spell lasts.
In addition, enchanted creatures cannot at-
tack those within the barrier in hand-to-hand
(melee) combat. (An enchanted creature is any
creature which is magically summoned or con-
trolled, such as a charmed character, or one that
is not harmed by normal weapons. A creature
that can be hit only by a silver weapon—a were-
wolf, for example—is not an enchanted crea-
ture.)
If anyone within the barrier attacks an en-
chanted creature, the barrier will no longer pre-
vent the creature from attacking hand-to-hand,
but the bonus to saving throws and penalty to
attack rolls will still apply.
Attackers, including enchanted creatures, can
attack people inside the barrier by using missile
or magical attacks. They do suffer the — 1 penal-
ty to attack rolls, but that is the only penalty
they suffer.
Protection from Normal Missiles
Range: 30'
Duration: 12 turns
Effect: One creature
This spell gives the recipient complete protec-
tion from all small nonmagical missiles (such as
arrows, quarrels, thrown spears, etc.); the
ranged attacks simply miss. Large or magical at-
tacks, such as a catapult stone or a magic arrow,
are not affected.
The spellcaster can cast the spell on any one
creature within the spell's range.
Water Breathing
Range: 30'
Duration: 1 day (24 hours)
Effect: One air-breathing creature
This spell allows the recipient to breathe while
underwater (at any depth). It does not affect his
movement in any way, nor does it interfere with
the breathing of air if the recipient emerges from
the water.
Fourth Level Magical Spells
Charm Monster
Range: 120'
Duration: Special
Effect: One or more living creatures
This spell effect is identical to that of a charm
person spell, but will affect any creature except
an undead monster. If cast on victims with 3 Hit
Dice or less, the spell will charm 3d6 (3-18) vic-
tims. Otherwise, it will charm only one victim.
Each victim may make a saving throw vs. spells
to avoid the effects.
Clothform
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Creates up to 30' x 30' cloth
This spell creates quantities of cloth up to
30'x30'. The cloth created by a single spell
must appear in one piece. Unlike many creation-
type spells, this one creates cloth that is non-
magical and cannot be dispelled.
If the campaign uses the optional general
skills and the caster has an appropriate Craft
skill, he may shape the cloth as he creates it. He
may thus create a tent, a sail, a single garment, a
drape, 60' of common rope, etc. If the campaign
doesn't use the skills rules, the character could
have been defined earlier as one who knows how
to work cloth in order for him to do this. Natu-
rally, unshaped cloth created by this spell can lat-
er be cut, sewn and otherwise fashioned into
such objects.
The cloth so created is much like undyed
linen—it's tough, serviceable, and unglamor-
ous. A caster can create his cloth with an unfin-
ished end, and later he or another caster can use
another clothform to create cloth joined to the
first on that edge—and there will be no seam or
weakness at the joining. This makes it a good
spell for creating rugged, dependable sails.
When created, the cloth extrudes from the
caster's hands and out along the ground. If there
are obstacles, it piles up against them but does
not shove them back. The spell may not be cast
to create a huge sheet which falls over a unit of
enemies, for instance. The cloth, when created,
may not be attached to anything except to an-
other expanse of clothform cloth, as described
above. The cloth cannot be cast in a space occu-
pied by another object.
In adventures, this spell is often used to make
quick shelters and to create rope.
Confusion
Range: 120'
Duration: 12 rounds
Effect: 3-18 creatures in an area 60' across
This spell will confuse its victims, affecting all
creatures within a 30' radius. Victims with less
than 2+1 Hit Dice are not allowed a saving
throw. Those with 2+1 or more Hit Dice must
make a saving throw vs. spells every round of the
spell's duration, if they remain in the area, or be
confused.
Confused creatures act randomly. The DM
should roll 2d6 each round to determine each
creature's action, using the following chart:
Confusion Results
2d6 Roll Result
Attack the spellcaster's party
2-5
6-8
Do nothing
9-12
Attack the creature's own party
Dimension Door
Range: 10'
Duration: 1 round
Effect: Safely transport one creature
This spell will transport one creature (either
the caster or a victim up to 10' from the caster) to
a place up to 360' away. The caster picks the de-
sired destination. If he does not know the loca-
tion, the caster may specify the direction and
distance of travel, but the distance cannot ex-
ceed a total of 360' (for example, 360' straight
up; or 200' west, 60' south, and 100' down).
If this would cause the recipient to arrive at a
location occupied by a solid object, the spell has
no effect.
An unwilling recipient may make a saving
throw vs. spells to avoid the effect.
Growth of Plants*
Range: 120'
Duration: Special
Effect: Enlarges 3000 square feet of plants
This spell causes normal brush or woods to be-
come thickly overgrown with vines, creepers,
thorns, and briars (or types of small plant-life
appropriate to the area). The spell affects an area
of up to 3,000 square feet (the caster chooses the
dimensions of the spell effect). The plants to be
affected must be entirely within the spell's
range.
The area affected by the spell is impassable to
all but giant-sized creatures. The effect lasts un-
til removed by the reversed form of the spell or
by a dispel magic spell.
The reverse of this spell, shrink plants, causes
all normal plants within the area of effect to
shrink and become passable. It may be used to
negate the effects of the normal spell. Shrink
plants will not affect plant-like monsters (such as
treants).
Hallucinatory Terrain
Range: 240'
Duration: Special
Effect: Changes or hides terrain in 240' radius
(or less)
This spell creates the illusion of a terrain fea-
ture, either indoors (such as a pit, stairs, etc.) or
outdoors (hill, swamp, grove of trees, etc.), pos-
sibly hiding a real feature. The caster could cre-
ate the illusion of solid ground over a series of
pits or quicksand pools, or he could create the
image of dense forest over his army's camp, etc.
The caster may choose to place his hallucinato-
ry terrain over a comparatively small area (for in-
stance, a throne room) or over a much larger one
(for example, a hill). If he chooses to cast the
spell on a larger terrain feature, the entire fea-
ture to be affected must be within the range of
the spell. (A hill with greater than a 480' diame-
ter would not be affected.)
The spell lasts until the illusion is touched by
an intelligent creature, or until dispelled.
Ice Storm/Wall of Ice
Range: 120'
Duration: Storm, 1 round; Wall, 12 turns
Effect: Storm in 20' x 20' x 20' volume; or Wall
of 1,200 square feet
This spell may be cast in either of two ways:
either as an icy blast, ice storm, or wall of ice.
An ice storm fills a 20' x 20' x 20' cube. If cast
in a smaller area, it will remain 20' long at most.
The storm inflicts 1d6 points of cold damage per
level of the caster to every creature in the area.
Each victim may make a saving throw vs. spells;
if he is successful, he takes only half damage.
Fire-type creatures (red dragons, flame salaman-
ders, etc.) have a — 4 penalty on their saving
throws, but cold-type creatures (frost giant, frost
salamander, etc.) are not affected by the spell.
A wall of ice is a thin vertical wall of any di-
mensions and shape determined by the spellcast-
er totalling 1,200 square feet or less (10' x 120',
30'x40', etc.). The wall is opaque and will
block sight. The wall must be cast to rest on the
ground or similar support, and cannot be cast in
a space occupied by another object.
Creatures of less than 4 Hit Dice or levels can-
not break through the wall. Creatures of 4 HD or
more levels can break through, but take 1d6
points of damage in the process. Fire-type crea-
tures each take twice the amount of damage
(2d6) while breaking through.
Massmorph
Range: 240'
Duration: See below
Effect: Causes illusion of trees within 240' range
This spell will affect up to 100 human or man-
sized creatures in a 240' diameter, making them
appear to be the trees of an orchard, dense
woods, or other large plant life appropriate to
the region. (Unless the campaign's deserts fea-
ture very large cactus, the spell won't work in the
desert.) Unwilling creatures are not affected.
Creatures larger than man-size (such as horses)
may be included, counting as two or three men
each. The illusion will hide the recipients from
creatures moving through the area affected.
The spell lasts until a dispel magic is cast on it
or until the caster decides to drop the illusion.
The appearance of each disguised creature re-
turns to normal if the creature moves out of the
affected area. However, movement within the
area does not destroy the illusion.
Polymorph Other
Range: 60'
Duration: Permanent until dispelled
Effect: Changes one living creature
This spell changes the victim into another liv-
ing creature. The new form may have no more
than twice as many Hit Dice as the original, or
the spell will fail. The victim's hit points remain
the same; an 8th level prince with 32 hit points
could end up as a frog with 32 hit points.
Unlike the polymorph self spell, the poly-
morph others spell actually turns the victim into
the new creature, giving him any and all special
abilities of the new form, plus its tendencies and
behavior. For example, a hobgoblin poly-
morphed into a mule will think and act like a
mule.
This spell cannot create a duplicate of a spe-
cific individual, only a race or monster type. For
example, a creature polymorphed into a 9th
level fighter will indeed become a human, but
not necessarily a fighter and no higher than 1st
level.
The victim of this spell may make a saving
throw vs. spells to avoid the effect. The effect
lasts until dispelled, or until the creature dies.
Polymorph Self
Range: 0 (Caster only)
Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn per level of the caster
Effect: Caster may change shapes
This spell allows the caster to change shape,
taking the physical form of another living crea-
ture. The Hit Dice of the new form must be
equal to or less than the Hit Dice of the caster, or
the spell will fail.
The caster's armor class, hit points, attack
rolls, and saving throws do not change, and he
does not gain special abilities (such as ghouls'
paralysis) or special immunities of the new form;
however, he does gain the natural physical abili-
ties of the new form. For example, a spellcaster
polymorphed into a frost giant has the strength
of a frost giant and the ability to hurl boulders,
but not immunity from cold. A spellcaster poly-
morphed into a dragon could fly but would not
be able to use any breath weapons or spells.
The spellcaster cannot cast spells while poly-
morphed into a different form. The spell lasts
for the listed duration, or until dispelled, or un-
til the caster is killed. This spell will not enable
the caster to take the form of a specific individ-
ual (see polymorph other).
Remove Curse*
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Removes any one curse
This spell removes one curse, whether on a
character, item, or area. Some curses—especially
those on magical items—may only be temporari-
ly removed, at the DM's discretion, requiring a
clerical dispel evil spell for permanently remov-
ing the effects (or possibly a remove curse cast by
a high-level spellcaster).
The reverse of this spell, curse, causes a mis-
fortune or penalty to affect the recipient. Curses
are limited only by the caster's imagination, but
if an attempted curse is too powerful, it may re-
turn to the caster (DM's discretion)! Safe limits
to curses may include: - 4 penalty on attack
rolls; - 2 penalty to all saving throws; prime req-
uisite reduced to half normal. The victim may
make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the curse.
Wall of Fire
Range: 60'
Duration: Concentration
Effect: Creates 1200 square feet of fire
This spell creates a thin vertical wall of fire of
any dimension and shape, determined by the
spellcaster, totalling 1,200 square feet (for exam-
ple, 10'x120', 20' x 60', 30'x40', etc.). The
wall is opaque and will block sight. The wall can-
not be cast is a space occupied by another object.
It lasts as long as the caster concentrates, without
moving, on it.
Creatures of less than 4 Hit Dice cannot break
through the wall. Creatures of 4 HD or more can
break through, but take 1d6 points of damage in
the process. Undead and cold-using creatures
(white dragons, frost giants, etc.) each take dou-
ble damage while breaking through.
Wizard Eye
Range: 240'
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: Creates movable invisible eye
This spell creates an invisible eye through
which the caster can see. It is the size of a real eye
and has infravision (60' range). The wizard eye
floats through the air at up to 120' per turn, but
will not go through solid objects nor move more
than 240' away from the caster. The spellcaster
must concentrate (without moving) to see
through the eye.
Fifth Level Magical Spells
Animate Dead
Range: 60'
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Creates zombies or skeletons
This spell allows the spellcaster to make ani-
mated, enchanted skeletons or zombies from
normal skeletons or dead bodies within range.
These animated undead creatures will obey the
cleric until they are destroyed by another cleric or
a dispel magic spell.
For each experience level of the cleric, he may
animate one Hit Die of undead. A skeleton has
the same Hit Dice as the original creature, but a
zombie has one Hit Die more than the original.
Note that this doesn't count character experi-
ence levels as Hit Dice: For purposes of this spell,
all humans and demihumans are 1 HD crea-
tures, so the remains of a 9th level thief would
be animated as a zombie with 2 HD.
Animated creatures do not have any spells.
but are immune to sleep and charm effects and
poison. Lawful clerics must take care to use this
spell only for good purpose. Animating the dead
is usually a Chaotic act.
Cloudkill
Range: 1'
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: Creates a moving poisonous cloud
This spell creates a circular cloud of poisonous
vapor, 30' across and 20' tall, which appears next
to the spellcaster. It moves away at the rate of 60'
(20' per round) in any one direction (with the
wind, if any; otherwise, in the direction chosen
by the caster). This cloud is heavier than air and
will sink when possible (going down holes, slid-
ing downhill, etc.). The cloud will evaporate if it
hits trees or thick vegetation. If cast in a small
area (such as in a 10' tall dungeon corridor), the
cloud may be of smaller than normal size.
All living creatures within the cloud take 1
point of damage per round. Any victim of less
than 5 Hit Dice must make a saving throw vs.
poison or be killed by the vapors.
Conjure Elemental
Range: 240'
Duration: Concentration
Effect: Summons one 16 HD elemental
This spell allows the caster to summon any one
elemental (AC -2, HD 16, Damage 3d8; see
the description of elementals in Chapter 14).
The caster can only summon one of each type of
elemental (earth, air, fire, water) in one day.
The elemental will perform any tasks within
its power (carrying, attacking, etc.) as long as the
caster maintains control by concentrating. The
caster cannot fight, cast other spells, or move
over half Normal Speed, else he will lose control
of the elemental. If he loses control, he cannot
regain it. An uncontrolled elemental will try to
slay its summoner, and may attack anyone in its
path while pursuing him.
The spell's caster may return a controlled ele-
mental to its home plane simply by concentra-
tion. A dispel magic or dispel evil spell can
return an uncontrolled elemental to its plane.
Contact Outer Plane
Range: 0 (spellcaster only)
Duration: See below
Effect: 3-12 questions may be answered
This spell allows the spellcaster to contact one
of the outer planes of existence to seek knowl-
edge from an Immortal creature—a powerful
magical being played by the DM. The wisest and
most powerful Immortals live on the most dis-
tant outer planes. However, mental contact with
an Immortal may cause a mortal to go insane.
The more distant the plane, the greater the
chance of a correct answer—but the greater the
chance of insanity as well.
The number of questions the spellcaster may
ask is equal to the "distance" to the outer plane.
"Distance" to any other plane of existence is
measured in the number of planes the character
would have to cross in order to visit that plane.
See the chart on page 264 to see where the vari-
ous planes of existence lie in relation to one an-
other. The "distance" between the Prime Plane
and the closest outer plane is 3—the Ethereal,
elemental, and Astral Planes lie "between"
them. There are many outer planes, many too
far removed to be affected by this spell.
The caster may choose the distance, up to the
maximum allowed. The DM checks the caster's
chance of insanity once, when the Immortal is
first contacted. If the caster is 21st level or
greater, the chance of insanity is reduced by 5%
per level of the caster above 20.
Even if insanity does not result, the Immortal
may still not know the answer to the character's
questions, or may lie, at the DM's discretion. If
the DM does not wish just to decide whether the
Immortal knows or is lying, he can roll on the
chart below to determine this.

The spellcaster can use this spell once a month

insane character recovers with rest, after a num-
ber of weeks of game time equal to the number
of the plane contacted.
Dissolve*
Range: 120'
Duration: 3-18 days
Effect: Liquifies 3000 square feet
This spell changes a volume of soil or rock (but
not a construction) to a morass of mud. An area
up to 10' deep or thick is affected, and may have
up to 3,000 square feet of surface area. The
magic-user may choose the exact width and
length (20' x 150', 30' x 100', etc.), but the en-
tire area of effect must be within 240' of the cast-
er. Creatures moving through the mud are
slowed to 10% of their normal movement rate at
best, and may become stuck (at the DM's discre-
tion, a victim must make saving throw vs. spells
to avoid becoming stuck).
The reverse of this spell (harden) will change
the same volume of mud to rock, but perma-
nently. A victim in the mud may make a saving
throw vs. spells to avoid being trapped in the
hardened mud.
Feeblemind
Range: 240'
Duration: Permanent until dispelled
Effect: Lowers Intelligence score to 2
This spell will only affect a magic-user, elf, or
a monster which can cast magical spells; it does
not affect those which cast only cleric or druid
spells.
It will make the victim helpless, unable to cast
spells or think clearly (as if the victim has an In-
telligence score of 2). The victim may make a
saving throw vs. spells to avoid the effect, but
with a -4 penalty to the roll.
The feeblemind lasts until removed by a dis-
pel magic spell (at normal chances for success) or
by a cleric's cureall spell.
Hold Monster*
Range: 120'
Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn per level of the caster
Effect: Paralyzes 1-4 creatures
This spell has an effect identical to that of a
hold person spell, but will affect any living crea-
ture. (It does not affect the undead.) Each victim
must make a saving throw vs. spells or be para-
lyzed. The spell may be cast at a single creature
or a group. If cast at a single creature, the victim
takes a - 2 penalty to his saving throw. If cast at
a group, it will affect 1d4 creatures (of the spell-
caster's choice, and within spell range), but with
no penalties to the saving throw.
The reverse of this spell, free monster, re-
moves the paralysis of up to four victims of hold
person or hold monster spells. It has no other ef-
fect.
Magic Jar
Range: 30'
Duration: See below
Effect: Take over one body
This spell causes the caster's body to fall into a
trance, while the caster's life force is placed in an
inanimate object (which is called a magic jar re-
gardless of its form; it does not have to be an ac-
tual jar) within range. From this object, the
caster's life force may attempt to take over any
one creature within 120' of the magic jar. If the
victim makes a successful saving throw vs. spells,
the attempt fails and the caster may not try to
take over that victim again for one turn. If the
victim fails the saving throw, the caster takes
over his body and the life force of the victim is
placed into the magic jar.
The caster may cause the body to perform any
normal actions, but not special abilities (similar
to a polymorph self effect). A dispel evil spell
will force the spellcaster's life force out of the vic-
tim's body and back into the magic jar. When
the spellcaster returns to his or her real body, the
victim's life force returns to his body and the
spell ends.
If the possessed body is destroyed, the victim's
life force dies, and the caster's life force returns
to the magic jar. From there the caster may try to
take over another body or return to the original
body.
If the magic jar is destroyed while the caster's
life force is within it, the caster is killed. If the
magic jar is destroyed while the caster's life force
is in a victim's body, the life force is stranded in
that body, and the life force of the body's origi-
nal owner is destroyed. If the caster's original
body is destroyed, his life force is stranded in the
magic jar until the caster can take over another
body!
The taking over of another body is a Chaotic
act.
Passwall
Range: 30'
Duration: 3 turns
Effect: Creates a hole 10' deep
This spell causes a hole 5' diameter, 10' deep
to appear in solid rock or stone only. The hole
may be horizontal or vertical.
The stone reappears at the end of the dura-
tion. If someone is still in the tunnel when the
stone reappears, he gets a saving throw vs. turn
to stone. If he succeeds, he is hurled out the
nearest end of the tunnel. If he fails, he is
trapped within the reappearing stone, and dies.
Telekinesis
Range: 120'
Duration: 6 rounds
Effect: 200 cn of weight per level of caster
This spell enables the spellcaster to move a
creature or object simply by concentrating. The
item may weigh up to 200 cn (20 lbs) per level of
the caster (a 10th level elf could move an object
weighing up to 2,000 cn, or 200 lbs). The caster
may move the object in any direction, at a rate of
up to 20' per round.
An unwilling victim may make a saving throw
vs. spells to avoid the effect. If he makes the roll,
he doesn't budge. If a target is being held by
someone, the holder can make a saving throw
with a — 2 penalty to retain the target item.
If the telekinesis grabs an object that is being
carried but not held in the hand, the owner may
grab for it as it is yanked away. To catch the de-
parting object, he must make a saving throw vs.
spells with a — 5 penalty.
The caster must concentrate while moving ob-
jects, and the objects will fall if the caster is dis-
turbed.
Teleport
Range: 10'
Duration: Instantaneous
Effect: Transports one creature with equipment
This spell instantly transports the spellcaster
or another recipient to any unoccupied destina-
tion on the same plane of existence. Distance
does not matter so long as the destination is on
the same plane. The recipient arrives at the des-
tination with all equipment he was carrying. An
unwilling victim can make a saving throw vs.
spell to avoid the spell effects.
The caster may not deliberately choose a desti-
nation he knows to be occupied by a solid object,
and he must choose to appear on a surface (such
as ground level or the top of a building); he can-
not choose to appear far up in the air.
Teleporting is dangerous; there is a chance the
teleporter will appear in a solid object. The tele-
porter's chance of arriving safely depends on how
carefully the caster has studied the area.
On the chart below, the DM determines how
well the caster knows the destination.
Teleport Chances
Knowledge of Destination
Result
Casual
General
Exact
01-50
01-80
Success
01-95
Too High
81-90
51-75
96-99
91-00
76-00
Too Low
"Casual Knowledge" means that the caster
has been there once or twice, or is visualizing the
aiming point from descriptions or magical
means. "General Knowledge" means the caster
has been to the area often, or has spent several
weeks studying the area magically (via crystal
ball, etc.). "Exact Knowledge" means the caster
has made a detailed personal study of the area.
Once the DM has determined how well the
character knows the destination, the DM rolls
d%. If the result is "Success," the teleporter ar-
rives exactly where the caster desired.
If the result is "Too High," the recipient ar-
rives 1d10 X 10' above the desired destination,
then falls, taking damage on impact (1d6 points
of damage per 10' fallen). (If he had already cast
a fly or levitate spell, or already had a flying de-
vice operating, he can avoid this damage.)
If the result is "Too Low," the recipient arrives
1d10 x 10' below the desired location. Any crea-
ture teleporting into a solid object is instantly
killed unless a vacant area (such as a cave or
dungeon) lies at that point (DM's discretion).
Wall of Stone
Range: 60'
Duration: Special
Effect: Creates 1000 cubic feet of stone
This spell creates a vertical stone wall exactly 2'
thick. The caster chooses the wall's dimensions
and shape, but its total area must be 500 square
feet or less (10' x 50', 20' x 25' , etc.), and the
entire wall must be within 60' of the caster.
The caster must create the wall where the wall
will rest on the ground or similar support, and
cannot create the wall in a space already occu-
pied by another object.
The wall lasts until it is dispelled or physically
broken.
If a wall of stone topples, it causes 10d10
points of damage to what it hits, and it shatters.
Woodform
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Creates 1,000 cubic feet of wood
This spell creates a mass of wood equal to
1,000 cubic feet; it may be arranged in any fash-
ion the caster desires (10' x
10' x
10' block,
25'x 20'x 2' wall, etc.)
Casting time varies depending on the com-
plexity of the design. A simple wall and other
simple shapes take 1 round. A simple staircase
may take 10 rounds (1 turn). A complicated de-
sign which is supposed to adhere to very tight
specifications—such as the keel of a ship—could
take the maximum time allowable, 12 turns (2
hours) just to work up in rough form. When the
caster wants to try a complicated design, the DM
decides how long the casting will take.
The object must be created as a single piece,
with no moving parts. The original caster of the
spell may later cast woodform on an object he
has already created with the same spell, in order
to modify it for up to two hours. This is how
spellcaster artists often make fine woodcarvings,
for instance. When he is satisfied with his work,
he casts woodform on it one last time to "lock it
in place," and it may no longer be modified by
woodform spells.
The mass of wood must be created so as to rest
on the ground or similar support, and cannot be
cast in a space occupied by another object.
A caster can create his wood with one or more
rough sides, and later he or another caster can
use another woodform to create wood perfectly
joined to the first on that side—and there will be
no seam or weakness at the joining. This makes
it a good spell for creating strong ships and
wooden buildings.
The caster may decide what sort of wood is cre-
ated, within reason. The DM may refuse to allow
the caster to pick very expensive, exotic, or magi-
cal woods.
The wood created by this spell is not dispella-
ble; it lasts until broken through, burned, or de-
stroyed by spells like disintegrate.
The armor class and hit points of building ma-
terials are given in the Fortifications Table on
page 137. Based on those guidelines, a wall of
wood has an AC of -4(6) and 60 hit points per
1' thickness. Most building exterior walls would
be about 8" thick and have 40 hit points.
Sixth Level Magical Spells
Anti-Magic Shell
Range: 0 (Caster only)
Duration: 12 turns
Effect: Personal barrier which blocks magic
This spell creates an invisible barrier around
the spellcaster's body (less than an inch away).
The barrier stops all spells or spell effects, in-
cluding the caster's. The caster may destroy the
shell at will; otherwise, it lasts for the duration.
Except for a wish, no magic (including a dispel
magic spell) can cancel the barrier.
Death Spell
Range: 240'
Duration: Instantaneous
Effect: Slays 4d8 (4-32) Hit Dice of creatures
within a 60' x 60' x 60' area
This spell will affect 4d8 (4-32) Hit Dice of liv-
ing creatures within the given area. Normal
plants and insects are automatically slain, and
those with no hit points (normal insects, plants
smaller than shrub-sized, for instance) are not
counted in the total affected. Undead are not af-
fected, nor are creatures with 8 or more Hit Dice
(or levels of experience).
The lowest Hit Dice creatures are affected
first. Each victim must make a saving throw vs.
death ray or die.
Disintegrate
Range: 60'
Duration: Instantaneous
Effect: Destroys one creature or object
This spell causes one creature or nonmagical
object to crumble to dust. A victim may make a
saving throw vs. death ray to avoid the effect.
(The spell can disintegrate a dragon, a ship, or a
10' section of wall, for example.)
The spell does not affect magical items or spell
effects.
Geas*
Range: 30'
Duration: Until completed or removed
Effect: Compels one creature
This spell forces a victim either to perform or
avoid a stated action. For example, a character
may be geased to bring back an object for the
caster, to eat whenever the chance arises, or never
to reveal certain information. The action must
be possible and not directly fatal or else the geas
will return and affect the caster instead!
When the spell is first cast, the victim may
make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the spell's
effect.
If the victim ignores the geas, penalties (de-
cided by the DM) are applied until the character
either obeys the geas or dies. Suitable penalties
include penalties in combat, lowered ability
scores, loss of spells, pain and weakness, and so
forth. Dispel magic and remove curse spells will
not affect a geas.
The geas makes the victim perform an action,
but does not make him think it is his own idea:
Once he finishes performing his task, he may de-
cide to exact revenge on the spellcaster.
The reverse of this spell, remove geas, will rid
a character of an unwanted geas and its effects.
However, if the caster is of a lower level than the
caster of the original geas, there is a chance of
failure (5% per level difference).
Invisible Stalker
Range: 0 (Caster only)
Duration: Until mission is accomplished
Effect: Summons one creature
This spell summons an invisible stalker (from
Chapter 14) which will perform one task for the
caster. The creature will serve the caster regard-
less of the time or distance involved, until the
task is completed or until the creature is slain. A
dispel evil spell will force the creature to return
to its home plane.
Lower Water
Range: 240'
Duration: 10 turns
Effect: Cuts depths to half normal
This spell causes a body of water to lower to
half its normal depth. It will affect an area up to
10,000 square feet (width and length). If cast on
a constantly-renewed source of water (such as a
river or ocean), it lowers that area of water for the
entire duration of the spell (or until it is dis-
pelled); surrounding water does not rush in until
the spell is ended. If cast around a boat or ship,
the vessel may become stuck.
At the end of the spell's duration, the sudden
rush of water filling the "hole" will sweep a
ship's deck clear of most items (and people who
fail their saving throws vs. spells) and cause
1d12 + 20 (21-32) points of hull damage.
This spell can turn a rampaging river into a
river which the heroes' party can ford, can cause
some pools to lower far enough for the adventur-
ers to see what's deeper in them, etc. If cast
around a boat or ship, this spell may cause the
bay or river to drop enough for the vessel to be-
come stuck.
Move Earth
Range: 240'
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: Moves soil
This spell causes soil (but not rock) to move.
The caster can use the spell to move earth hor-
izontally to make a hill, or vertically, to open a
large hole (one up to 240' deep, unless it reaches
solid rock). The spell moves the soil at up to 60'
per turn, and at the end of the spell duration,
the moved soil remains where it is put. This spell
is helpful for constructing castles.
Projected Image
Range: 240'
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: Creates one image
This spell creates an image of the caster up to
240' away; the image will last without concentra-
tion. The projected image cannot be distin-
guished from the original except by touch. Any
spell the spellcaster casts will seem to come from
the image, but the caster must still be able to see
the target.
Spells and missile attacks will not appear to af-
fect the image. If the image is touched or struck
by a hand-to-hand weapon, it disappears.
Reincarnation
Range: 10'
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Creates a new body
To cast this spell, the magic-user must have a
part (however small) of a dead body. The spell
magically creates a new body, and the life force
which was once in the dead body returns and in-
habits the new one. The DM can choose what
sort of body is created, or can refer to the tables
below to decide.
If the life force is reincarnated as a different
race, all details of the new race apply, instead of
the old. For example, a cleric reincarnated as an
elf is no longer a cleric, but is able to cast magic-
user spells and fight as an elf.
The victim's level of experience does not
change unless restricted by the maximum for
demihumans. If the victim is reincarnated in a
monster body, the victim's alignment helps de-
termine the type of monster which appears; a
character will not be reincarnated in the body of
a monster that cannot have his alignment. A
monster body may not gain levels of experience;
the character must play as the reincarnated crea-
ture, or retire from play, or (perhaps) be reincar-
nated again when slain.

The DM may add more monsters to the lists.
Such monsters should have 8 Hit Dice or less and

Stone to Flesh*
Range: 120'
Duration: Permanent
Effect: One creature or object
This spell turns any one statue (or quantity of
stone up to 10' x 10' x 10') to flesh. It is usually
used to restore a character turned to stone (by
gorgon breath, for example).
The reverse of this spell, flesh to stone, will
turn one living creature, including all equip-
ment carried, to stone. The victim may make a
saving throw vs. turn to stone to avoid the effect.
Stoneform
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Creates 1,000 cubic feet of stone
This spell creates a mass of stone equal to
1,000 cubic feet; it may be arranged in any fash-
ion the caster desires (10'x 10' x 10' block,
25'x 20'x 2'wall, etc.).
Casting time varies depending on the com-
plexity of the design. A simple wall and other
simple shapes take 1 round. A simple staircase
may take 10 rounds (1 turn). A complicated de-
sign meant to adhere to very tight
specifications—such as an ornate fountain or
statue—could take the maximum time allowa-
ble, 12 turns (2 hours), just to work up in rough
form. When the caster wants to try a compli-
cated or unusual design, the DM decides how
long the casting will take.
The object must be created as a single piece,
with no moving parts. The original caster of the
spell may later cast Stoneform on an object he
has already created with the same spell in order
to modify it for up to two hours. This is how
magic-user artists often make fine statues, for in-
stance. When he is satisfied with his work, the
magic-user casts Stoneform on it one last time to
"lock it in place," and it may no longer be modi-
fied by Stoneform spells.
The mass of stone must be created to rest on
the ground or similar support, and cannot be
cast in a space occupied by another object.
A caster can create his stone with one or more
rough sides, and later he or another caster can
use another Stoneform to create stone joined to
the first on that side—and there will be no seam
or weakness at the joining. This makes it a good
spell for creating strong walls and gigantic
buildings—colisea, palaces, etc.
The caster may decide what sort of stone is cre-
ated, within reason. The DM may refuse to allow
the caster to pick very expensive, exotic, or magi-
cal stones. Valuable jade, for instance, is an in-
appropriate choice. However, a caster can choose
such stones as clear lead crystal, and so make
thick, strong, perfect windows with this spell.
The stone is not dispellable; it lasts until bro-
ken or destroyed by spells like disintegrate.
The armor class and hit points of building ma-
terials are given on the Fortifications Table on
page 137. In general, from those guidelines,
stone walls have an AC of -4(6) and 100 hit
points per 1' thickness; doing 500 hit points of
damage to a 5' wall will definitely knock a hole
in it. Building exterior walls tend to be about 7"
thick and have 60 hit points.
Wall of Iron
Range: 120'
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Creates 500 square feet of iron
This spell creates a vertical wall of iron exactly
2' thick. The magic-user may choose any length
and width, but the total area must be 500 square
feet or less (10' x 50', 20' x 25' , etc.), and the
entire wall must be within 120' of the caster. The
caster must create the wall so it rests on the
ground or similar support. It cannot be cast in a
space occupied by another object. It lasts until
dispelled, disintegrated, or physically broken
(though it will resist all but giant-sized physical
attacks). Most other spell effects, including fire-
ball, lightning bolt, etc., have no effect on a wall
of iron. If the wall is made to topple, it causes
10d10 (10-100) points of damage to whatever it
hits, and shatters.
If the wall is attacked, it has a number of hit
points equal to the level of the caster. A rust
monster can destroy a wall of iron with a single
touch. Otherwise, the wall can only be damaged
by battering; see Chapter 9 (page 118) for more
on battering attacks.
Weather Control
Range: 0 (magic-user only)
Duration: Concentration
Effect: All weather within 240 yards
This spell allows the magic-user to create one
special weather condition in the surrounding ar-
ea (within a 240 yard radius). The spellcaster
may select the weather condition. The spell only
works outdoors, and the weather will affect all
creatures in the area (including the caster). The
effects last as long as the spellcaster concentrates,
without moving; if the caster is being moved (for
example, aboard a ship), the effect moves also.
The spell's effects vary, but the following results
are typical:
Rain: - 2 penalty to attack rolls applies to all
missile fire. After three turns, the ground be-
comes muddy, reducing movement to half the
normal rate.
Snow: Visibility (the distance a creature can
see) is reduced to 20'; movement is reduced to
half the normal rate. Rivers and streams may
freeze over. Mud remains after the snow thaws,
for the same movement penalty.
Fog: 20' visibility, half normal movement.
Those within the fog might become lost, moving
in the wrong direction.
Clear: This cancels bad weather (rain, snow,
fog) but not secondary effects (such as mud).
Intense Heat: Movement reduced to half nor-
mal. Excess water (from rain, snow, mud trans-
muted from rock, etc.) dries up.
High Winds: No missile fire or flying is possi-
ble. Movement reduced to half normal. At sea,
ships sailing with the wind move 50% faster. In
the desert, high winds create a sandstorm, for
half normal movement and 20' visibility.
Tornado: This creates a whirlwind under the
magic-user control, attacking and moving as if it
was a 12 HD air elemental. At sea, treat the tor-
nado as a storm or gale.
Seventh Level Magical Spells
Charm Plant
Range: 120'
Duration: 6 months (see below)
Effect: Charms one tree or more smaller plants
Similar to a charm person spell, this effect
causes one tree, six medium-sized bushes, 12
small shrubs, or 24 small plants to become
friends of the magic-user (no saving throw).
However, a plant-like monster (treant, shrieker,
etc.) may make a saving throw vs. spells to resist
the effect.
The charmed plants will understand and obey
all commands of the magic-user, as long as the
tasks are within their ability (including the en-
tangling of passers-by within range, but not in-
cluding movement, sensing alignment, etc.).
The plants will remain charmed for six months,
until the charm is dispelled, or until winter
(when they sleep). (This spell is quite useful
around a stronghold, both inside and out, espe-
cially when used after a 4th level growth of
plants spell, and possibly a permanence as well.)
Create Normal Monsters
Range: 30'
Duration: 1 turn
Effect: Creates 1 or more monsters
This spell causes monsters to appear out of
thin air. All monsters appearing will understand
and obey the caster's commands—fighting, car-
rying or fetching things, etc. They will faithfully
obey all commands to the best of their abilities.
Each monster will appear carrying its normal
weapons and wearing its normal armor (if any),
but arrives otherwise unequipped. At the end of
one turn, all the monsters created vanish back
into thin air, along with all their equipment. (If
a monster has dropped a weapon while fighting
and then vanishes, the weapon disappears, too.)
The total number of Hit Dice of monsters ap-
pearing is equal to the level of the magic-user
casting the spell. (If the spellcaster's level is not
an exact multiple of the monsters' Hit Dice,
drop all fractions). The magic-user may choose
the exact type of monsters created, but he must
select only monsters with no special abilities
(i.e., no asterisk next to the Hit Die number in
the monster explanation). This spell does not
create humans, demihumans, or undead. Crea-
tures of 1-1 Hit Dice are counted as 1 Hit Die;
creatures of 1/2 Hit Die or less are counted as 1/2
Hit Die each.
Example: With this spell, a 15th level caster
could summon 30 giant bats, rats, or kobolds
(1/2 Hit Die monsters); or 15 goblins, orcs, or
hobgoblins (1 Hit Die monsters); or 7 rock ba-
boons, gnolls, or lizard men (2 Hit Die mon-
sters); or 5 boars, draco lizards, or bugbears (3
Hit Die monsters); or 3 black bears, panthers, or
giant weasels (5 Hit Die monsters); and so forth.
Delayed Blast Fireball
Range: 240'
Duration: 0 to 60 rounds
Effect: Delayed blast fireball of 20' radius
As the name implies, this is a fireball spell
whose blast can be delayed; it behaves like a
time bomb. When he casts the spell, the magic-
user states the exact number of rounds of delay
(from 0 to 60) until the spell detonates. A small
rock, very similar in appearance to a valuable
gem, then shoots out toward the desired loca-
tion, and remains at that location until the
stated delay elapses. The "gem" may be picked
up, carried, and so forth.
When the stated duration ends, it explodes in
an effect identical to a normal fireball—a sud-
den instantaneous explosion inflicting 1d6
points of damage per level of the caster to all
within the area of effect (a sphere of 20' radius).
Each victim may make a saving throw vs. spells
to take half damage.
Once the spell has been cast, the explosion
cannot be hurried nor further delayed, except
with a wish. The "gem" created is pure magic,
not an actual object, and cannot be moved magi-
cally (by telekinesis, teleport, etc.); however, it
can be dispelled.
Ironform
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Creates 500 square feet of iron
This spell creates a wall of iron 2" thick (or
less) with an area equal to 500 square feet; it may
be arranged in any fashion the caster desires
(10'x 50' wall, or 25' X 20' wall, etc.)
Casting time varies depending on the com-
plexity of the design. A simple wall and other
simple shapes take 1 round. A simple staircase
may take 10 rounds (1 turn). A complicated de-
sign which is supposed to adhere to very tight
specifications—such as a giant portcullis—could
take the maximum time allowable, 12 turns (2
hours) just to create in rough form. When the
caster wants to try a complicated or unusual de-
sign, the DM decides how long the casting will
take.
The object must be created as a single piece,
with no moving parts. The original caster of the
spell may later cast ironform on an object he has
already created with the same spell, in order to
modify it for up to two hours. This is how magic-
user artists often make fine iron statues, for in-
stance. When he is satisfied with his work, he
casts ironform on it one last time to "lock it in
place," and it may no longer be modified by
ironform spells.
The iron wall must be created to rest on the
ground or similar support, and cannot be cast in
a space occupied by another object. Unlike the
metal created by the wall of iron spell, it does
not have to be created in a vertical position.
A caster can create his iron with one or more
tough sides, and later he or another caster can
use another ironform to create iron joined to the
first on that side—and there will be no seam or
weakness at the joining. This makes it a good
spell for creating iron reinforcements for walls.
The iron so created is not dispellable; it lasts
until broken or destroyed by spells like disinte-
grate or creatures such as rust monsters.
The armor class and hit points of building ma-
terials are given in the Fortifications Table on
page 137. Following these general guidelines,
we find that an iron wall will have an AC of —
10(2) and about 15 hit points per 1" thickness.
Lore
Range: 0 (magic-user only)
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Reveals details of 1 item, place, or person
By means of this spell, the magic-user may
gain knowledge of one item, place, or person. If
the caster holds the item being studied, the spell
takes 1d4 turns to complete, and the magic-user
learns the item's name, method of operation and
command words (if any), and approximate num-
ber of charges (if any, within five of the correct
number).
If the item has more than one mode of opera-
tion, or more than one command word, only one
function will be revealed for each lore spell used,
and the spell will not even hint that the object
has any other functions.
If the spell is being used to investigate a place
or person, or an item which the caster is not
holding, the spell may take 1d100 days to com-
plete. A purely legendary topic should require
large amounts of time, and the information
gained may be in the form of a riddle or poem.
The Dungeon Master should reveal only general
details if the place is large, or if the person is of
great power.
Magic Door*
Range: 10'
Duration: 7 uses
Effect: Creates one passage
This spell may be cast on any wall, floor, ceil-
ing, or section of ground. It creates a magical,
invisible doorway that only the spellcaster may
use. It also creates a passage through up to 10' of
non-living solid material beyond the doorway it-
self. It cannot be created in a living object of any
kind. The door is undetectable except by a de-
tect magic spell, and cannot be destroyed except
by a dispel magic spell (at normal chances for
success).
The magic door lasts until dispelled, or until it
has been used seven times. Note that each one-
way passage through the door is counted as a
separate use.
The reverse of this spell, magic lock, is a pow-
erful version of the 2nd level wizard lock spell,
but cannot be affected by a knock spell or by the
effects of any magical item. The magic lock
causes any one portal to become totally impass-
able as long as the magic remains; only the spell-
caster can use the portal. The spell can affect an
empty 10' X 10' portal-like area (such as an emp-
ty doorway). The locked portal does not change
in appearance. As with a magic door, the en-
chantment remains until the portal has been
used seven times or until removed by a dispel
magic spell.
Mass Invisibility*
Range: 240'
Duration: Permanent until broken
Effect: Creatures or objects in 60' square area
This bestows invisibility (as the 2nd level
spell) on several creatures. All the recipients
must be within an area 60' square within 240' of
the magic-user. The spell will affect up to 6
dragon-sized creatures, or up to 300 man-sized
creatures. After the spell is cast, each creature
becomes invisible, along with all equipment it
carries (as per the invisibility spell, above). An
invisible creature will remain invisible until he or
she attacks or casts any spell.
The reverse of this spell, (appear), will cause
all invisible creatures and objects in a
20' x 20' x 20' volume to become visible. Crea-
tures on the Astral and Ethereal planes are not
within the area of effect; the spell cannot reach
across planar boundaries. All other forms of in-
visibility are affected, both magical and natural,
and all victims of this spell cannot become invisi-
ble again for one full turn.
Power Word Stun
Range: 120'
Duration: 2d6 or 1d6 turns
Effect: Stuns 1 creature of 70 hp or less
This lets the caster stun one victim within 120'
(no saving throw). A victim with 1-35 hit points
is stunned for 2d6 turns; a victim with 36-70 hit
points is stunned for 1d6 turns. No creature with
71 or greater hit points is affected.
Reverse Gravity
Range: 90'
Duration: 1/5 round (2 seconds)
Effect: Causes victims in a 30' cubic volume to
fall upward
This spell affects all creatures and objects
within a cubic volume 30'x 30'x 30', causing
them to "fall" in a direction opposite the nor-
mal gravity. In two seconds, creatures and objects
can "fall" a maximum of 65'. No saving throw is
allowed, and all victims hitting a ceiling or other
obstruction take 1d6 points of damage per 10'
"fallen." Note that after the two seconds have
elapsed, gravity returns to normal and all victims
will fall back to their original places, suffering
more falling damage. The DM should make a
morale check for each NPC victim of this spell.
Example: A magic-user casts this spell at a
group of approaching giants in a 40' tall room.
The giants "fall" to the ceiling and then back to
the floor, each taking a total of 8d6 points of
damage in the process: 4d6 from "falling" up
and hitting the ceiling, and another 4d6 from
falling back down to the floor.
Statue
Range: 0 (Magic-user only)
Duration: 2 turns per level of the caster
Effect: Allows caster to turn to stone
This allows the magic-user to change into a
statue, along with all nonliving equipment he
carries, up to once per round (to or from statue
form) for the duration of the spell. The caster
can concentrate on other spells while in statue form, though he can cast no new spells while in
this form. Although this spell does not give him
immunity to "turn to stone" effects (from a gor-
gon's attack), the caster may simply turn back to
normal one round after becoming petrified.
While in statue form, the magic-user is armor
class -4, but cannot move. He cannot be dam-
aged by cold or fire (whether normal or magical)
or by normal weapons. He does not breathe, and
is thus immune to all gas attacks, drowning, etc.
Magical weapons and other spells (such as light-
ning bolt) inflict normal damage on him. If a
fire or cold spell is cast at the magic-user while in
normal form, the character need only win initia-
tive (with a + 2 bonus) to turn into a statue be-
fore the attacking spell strikes.
Summon Object
Range: Infinite
Duration: Instantaneous
Effect: Retrieves one object from caster's home
By means of this spell, the magic-user can
cause one nonliving object to leave the spellcast-
er's home and appear in his hand. The object
must weigh no more than 500 cn (50 pounds),
and may be no bigger than a staff or small chest.
The spellcaster must be very familiar with the
item and its exact location, or the spell will not
work. The caster must also have prepared the
item beforehand by sprinkling it with a special
powder that costs 1,000 gold pieces per item pre-
pared; the powder becomes invisible and does
not interfere with the item in any way. The spell
cannot summon items that have not been pre-
pared in this fashion.
If the magic-user prepares a chest for use with
this spell, fills the chest with weapons and magi-
cal items, and then later tries to summon it to
him, the chest appears—empty. All its contents
stay behind, where the chest originally stood,
since they have not been magically prepared for
use with the spell, and since the spell can sum-
mon only one prepared object at a time.
If another being possesses the item summon-
ed, it will not appear, but the caster will know
approximately who and where the possessor is.
The magic-user may use this spell from any lo-
cation, even if the item summoned is on another
plane of existence.
Sword
Range: 30'
Duration: 1 round per level of the caster
Effect: Creates a magical sword
When this spell is cast, a glowing sword made
of magic, rather than metal, appears next to the
caster. The magic-user may cause it to attack any
creature within 30', simply by concentrating; the
sword flies to the target and attacks. If the cast-
er's concentration is broken, the sword merely
stops attacking. It remains in existence for one
round per level of the spellcaster.
The sword moves very quickly, attacking twice
per round and making its attack rolls at the cast-
er's level. Damage is the same as a two-handed
sword (1d10), but this magical creation is capa-
ble of hitting any target (even those hit only by
powerful magical weapons).
The sword cannot be destroyed before the du-
ration ends, except by a dispel magic spell effect
(at normal chances of success) or a wish.
Teleport Any Object
Range: Touch
Duration: Instantaneous
Effect: Causes 1 object to teleport
This spell is similar to the 5th level teleport
spell, but nonliving objects can be affected. Af-
ter casting this spell, the spellcaster may touch
one creature or object and cause it to teleport.
The normal chance of error apply (see the de-
scription of the teleport spell above) an object
appearing too high will fall and probably break,
while one appearing too low will be destroyed
instantly. If the spellcaster uses this spell to tele-
port himself, there is no chance for error. The
caster may not deliberately choose a destination
occupied by a solid object or in open air above
the ground.
The maximum weight affected is 500 cn (50
pounds) per level of the caster. If an object is a
solid part of a greater whole (such as a section of
wall), the spell will teleport a maximum of one
10' x 10' x 10' cube of material. If the caster is
trying to teleport a creature that weighs more
than the spell allows, the spell fails.
If another creature holds or carries the item
which the caster is trying to teleport, the creature
may make a saving throw vs. spells (with a —2
penalty). If the saving throw is successful, the
teleport fails.
If the caster touches another creature, the tar-
get creature may make a saving throw vs. spells
(if so desired) to avoid being teleported, but
with a -2 penalty to the roll.
Eighth Level Magical Spells
Clone
Range: 10'
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Grows one duplicate creature from a
piece of the original creature
A clone is an exact duplicate of another living
creature, grown from a piece of the original
through the use of this spell. The piece need not
be alive at the time the spell is cast.
A human or demihuman clone is rare and may
be very dangerous. A clone of any other living
creature is a more common thing called a simula-
crum. A character can have only one clone at a
time; attempts at making multiple clones of a
single character automatically fail. Undead and
constructs cannot be cloned, because they are
not living creatures. (You could clone someone
from flesh taken before that person became un-
dead, but he would not be subject to the effects
described below for situations where two exam-
ples of the same person exist.)
Human and demihuman clones: To create a
human or demihuman clone, this spell must be
cast on one pound of the person's flesh. This
spell requires the caster to use up other materials
costing 5,000 gold pieces per Hit Die of the orig-
inal. The clone awakens only when fully grown;
this takes one week per Hit Die of the clone.
When completed, the clone is not magical and
cannot be dispelled.
If the human or demihuman original is not
alive when the clone awakens, the clone has all
the features, statistics (abilities), and memories
possessed by the original at the time the flesh
was taken. This is a very important point. For ex-
ample, a 20th level magic-user might leave a
pound of flesh with a scroll of this spell, so that
he might be restored if lost; but if the character
gains another ten levels of experience and then
dies, the clone will be the younger, less-
experienced, 20th level form.
If a clone duplicates a person still living, or if
the original person regains life, a very hazardous
situation develops. Each form instantly becomes
aware of the other's existence. A partial mind-
link exists between them; each can feel the oth-
er's emotions (but no other thoughts). If either
one is damaged, the other takes the same dam-
age (but may make a saving throw vs. spells to
take half damage). This effect does not apply to
charm, sleep, cures, or other effects that do not
cause damage.
The clone is immediately obsessed with the
need to destroy its original and will do anything
to accomplish this. From the time a clone be-
comes aware of its original, it has one day per
level of its creator (i.e., the caster of the clone
spell) to kill the original.
Example: A 25th level fighter dies. His friend
the 34th level magic-user, who possesses a pound
of the fighter's flesh for this precise purpose,
clones him. Then someone else raises the fighter
from the dead. The clone becomes aware of his
original and is compelled to kill him. He has 34
days to do so—one day for every experience level
of his creator.
If the clone succeeds in killing its original, it
can continue with its life normally; but if it fails
and does not immediately die, it becomes in-
sane.
When a clone goes insane, the original crea-
ture permanently loses one point of Intelligence
and one point of Wisdom. The original may also
thereafter become insane (5% chance per day,
not cumulative). If this occurs, the victim and
the clone die one week later, both forever dead
and unrecoverable even with a wish.
Special Note: If the original and the clone are
kept on different planes of existence, no mind-
link occurs, and the clone is not compelled to kill
its original. No ill effects occur, and the two re-
main completely unaware of their situation. If
they ever occupy the same plane, the mind-link
occurs and cannot be broken thereafter except by
the destruction of the clone or its original.
Other clones: A clone of any other living crea-
ture (not a human or demihuman) is called a
simulacrum. One percent of the original's flesh
is needed, and the cost of other materials is 500
gold pieces per hit point of the original. As with
a normal clone, the time required to grow a sim-
ulacrum is one week per Hit Die of the original.
A simulacrum always obeys its creator (the
spellcaster). It understands all the languages
spoken by the caster. Within a range of 10' per
level of the caster, it can receive mental com-
mands if the creator concentrates on sending
them.
A simulacrum is an enchanted monster. It can
be blocked by a protection from evil spell and is
magical; a dispel magic spell can (subject to nor-
mal chances of failure for that spell) cause it to
vanish without a trace.
The simulacrum's alignment is the same as
that of the spellcaster, regardless of the original
creature's alignment. Its armor class, movement
rate, morale, and number of attacks are the same
as the original's.
A simulacrum has only 50% of the original's
Hit Dice, hit points, and damage per attack. The
DM rolls d100 for each special ability; it is present
in the simulacrum if the result is 01-50. However,
a freshly grown simulacrum never has any of the
spells or spell-like abilities of the original.
If the original creature is alive, the simula-
crum does not grow beyond this point. If the
original creature dies (or is already dead), the
simulacrum continues to increase in abilities,
gaining an additional 5% per week to a maxi-
mum of 90% of the original's statistics. When
complete, the DM rolls again to see which spe-
cial abilities previously missing are gained, in-
cluding spells and spell-like abilities (using the
90% chance for each; all may be present).
Create Magical Monsters
Range: 60'
Duration: Two turns
Effect: Creates one or more monsters
This spell is similar to the 7th level create nor-
mal monsters spell, except that it can create
monsters with some special abilities (up to two
asterisks). The range and duration are double
those of the lesser spell. All other details are the
same: the creatures are chosen by the caster, ap-
pear out of thin air, and vanish at the end of the
spell duration.
The total number of Hit Dice of monsters ap-
pearing is equal to the level of the magic-user
casting the spell (again, dropping fractions if the
caster's level is not an exact multiple of the crea-
tures' Hit Dice). The spell does not create hu-
mans or demihumans, but can create undead.
Creatures of 1-1 Hit Die count as 1 Hit Die; crea-
tures of 1/2 Hit Die or less count as 1/2 Hit Die
each.
Special Note: This spell can create a construct
(as defined in Chapter 14) if the spellcaster uses
the materials normally required for the con-
struct's creation. Only one construct will appear,
regardless of the caster's Hit Dice; but it is per-
manent, and does not vanish at the end of the
spell duration—though it still may be dispelled
at normal chances of success. This construct may
have only two asterisks (special abilities) or less;
see Chapter 14 for lists of the known types of
constructs and the number of special abilities
they have. The cost of materials is a minimum of
5,000 gold pieces per asterisk (or more, depend-
ing on your campaign). Chapter 16 contains
more rules for enchanting magical items (includ-
ing constructs), and has suggestions regarding
nondispellable constructs.
Dance
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 or more rounds
Effect: Causes 1 victim to dance
This spell causes one victim to prance madly
about, performing a jig or other dance, for 3 or
more rounds. The magic-user must touch the
victim for the spell to take effect (a normal attack
roll). The victim gets no saving throw, and can-
not attack, use spells (or spell-like abilities), or
flee. While dancing, the victim suffers a — 4
penalty to his saving throws, and a +4 penalty
to his armor class.
The duration is three rounds for a caster of
18th to 20th level; four rounds for levels 21-24,
five rounds at levels 25-28, six rounds at levels
29-32, and seven rounds at levels 33-36.
Explosive Cloud
Range: 1'
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: Creates a moving poisonous cloud
This spell creates an effect which looks identi-
cal to the 5th level cloudkill spell (a 20' tall cloud
of greenish gas 30' in diameter appearing next to
the caster). The cloud is only mildly poisonous;
all victims within it must make a saving throw vs.
spells or be paralyzed that round. Each victim
within the cloud makes a new saving throw each
round.
The cloud is filled with sparkling lights (visi-
ble only to those within it), which are small ex-
plosions. Each round, all those within the cloud
take damage from the explosions, with no saving
throw allowed. This damage is 1 point for each
two levels of experience of the magic-user,
rounded down (9 points at 18th or 19th level, 10
points at 20th or 21st level, etc.). This explosive
damage will affect any creature, including those
immune to fire, gas, electricity, and other special
attacks.
Force Field
Range: 120'
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: Creates an invisible barrier
This spell creates an invisible, immovable bar-
rier or object of pure force. It has almost no
thickness, but cannot be broken or destroyed by
any means except a disintegrate spell or a wish;
even a dispel magic spell cannot affect it. A force
field's shape is limited to a sphere, hemisphere,
a flat surface, a cylinder, a square or rectangular
box with flat sides, or part of such a box. The
sphere's radius can be a maximum of 20'. The
flat surface or combinations thereof may be up
to 5,000 square feet in total area. The force field
cannot be irregular in shape, and its surface must
be perfectly smooth. It can be as small as the
caster desires.
The force field will not appear within any
solid or creature. Any part of it that would do so
will not appear, leaving a hole in the force
field—normally, a hole large enough for the vic-
tim to escape through. Furthermore, the edges
of the field are blunt and cannot cause damage
in any way. The force field will stay where it is
put until it disappears, and cannot be moved by
any means but a wish.
Creature(s) completely enclosed by a sealed
force field will not starve, suffer from lack of air,
or otherwise be harmed by the encasement. A
sealed force field magically preserves any within
it from natural death. This does not prevent
damage or death from attacks by others within
the force field.
Nothing can pass through a force field. Spells,
missiles, blows, breath weapons, and all other
attack forms merely bounce off it. However, a
teleport or dimension door spell can bypass it;
these spells allow the caster to travel into or out
of the field without harming the field. The force
field exists only on one plane of existence. Thus,
planar travel (via gate or other means) can also
bypass it.
Though most often used as a barrier or cage, a
force field can easily be used to create an invisi-
ble floor, stairway, chair, or other object. A force
field can be made permanent, but the perma-
nence spell is still subject to dispel magic, and if
removed, the force field disappears immediately.
Even if treated with a permanence spell, a force
field will always vanish if struck by a disintegrate
spell or wished away.
Mass Charm*
Range: 120'
Duration: Special (as charm person spell)
Effect: 30 Levels of creatures
This spell creates the same effect as a charm
person or charm monster spell, except that the
spell affects 30 levels (or Hit Dice) at once. Each
victim may make a saving throw vs. spells to
avoid the charm, but with a -2 penalty to the
roll. The spell will not affect a creature of 31 or
more levels or Hit Dice.
The duration of each charm is determined by
the victim's Intelligence (see charm person,
above). If the magic-user attacks one of the
charmed victims, only that one creature's charm
is automatically broken. Any other charmed
creatures seeing the attack may make another
saving throw, but other creatures' charms are not
affected.
The reverse of this spell, remove charm, will
unfailingly remove all charm effects within a
20' x 20' x 20' volume. It will also prevent any
object in that area from creating charm effects
for one turn.
Mind Barrier*
Range: 10'
Duration: 1 hour per level of the caster
Effect: Protects against mind-affecting spells and
items
This spell affects one creature; an unwilling
recipient may make a saving throw vs. spells to
avoid the effect.
The spell prevents any form of ESP, clairvoy-
ance, clairaudience, crystal ball gazing, or any
other form of mental influence or information
gathering (such as by a contact higher plane or
summon object) from working on the target
creature. The caster or recipient simply does not
exist for the purposes of those and similar spell
effects for the duration of the mind barrier spell.
In addition, the recipient gains a bonus of +8
to saving throws against mind-influencing at-
tacks, such as all forms of charm, illusion and
phantasms, feeblemind, and the like. (However,
a roll of 1 always fails the saving throw, regard-
less of adjustments.)
The reverse of this spell, open mind, causes
the victim touched to be vulnerable to all the
mind-influencing attacks given above. All the
victim's saving throws against such effects are pe-
nalized by - 8 for the duration of the spell. This
reversed spell must be cast by touch, requiring a
normal attack roll.
Permanence
Range: 10'
Duration: Permanent until dispelled
Effect: Causes one magical effect to become per-
manent
By means of this spell, the magic-user can
cause one other magic-user spell effect of 7th
level or less to become permanent. This spell will
not make permanent any spell which has an "in-
stantaneous" or "permanent" duration (such as
dispel magic, fireball, lightning bolt, etc.); cleri-
cal spells and 8th or 9th level magic-user spells
also cannot be made permanent.
The DM can declare that the permanence
spell will not work with any other specific spell.
Whenever a character wishes to cast the spell, the
DM should carefully consider whether perma-
nence will affect the other spell. Certain spell
combinations could seriously affect a campaign's
game balance, and the DM should carefully reg-
ulate all uses of this spell.
A permanence spell lasts until dispelled by a
dispel magic spell from either the caster or some
higher-level spellcaster (at normal chances for
success). When the permanence spell is dis-
pelled, the other spell effect vanishes immedi-
ately.
Except for weapons, an item can only receive
one permanence spell, and a creature can receive
two at most. If a permanence spell is cast on an
item or area that already has one in effect (or a
creature which already has two, or a weapon
which already has five), both permanence spells
automatically fail. A weapon may have up to five
permanent effects, but a 25% (noncumulative)
chance of failure applies to each permanence af-
ter the first. Furthermore, if the permanence
fails, it destroys the weapon completely.
Some spells used on a creature that are com-
monly made permanent are: detect magic, pro-
tection from evil, read languages, read magic,
detect invisible, and fly. Some spells commonly
made permanent on areas are light, phantasmal
force, confusion, and cloudkill.
A magic-user does not need a permanence
spell to make any permanent magical item. Us-
ing permanence to bind a spell to an object is not
the same as enchanting the object. Enchanted
objects are more durable and permanent than
objects which have merely had spells perma-
nently placed upon them.
Polymorph any Object
Range: 240'
Duration: See below
Effect: Changes form of one object or creature
This spell is similar to the 4th level polymorph
others spell, except that it will affect objects as
well as creatures. If the object is part of a greater
whole (such as a section of wall), the spell will
affect up to a 10' x 10' X 10' volume. A creature
may avoid the effects if it successfully makes a
saving throw vs. spells at a -4 penalty to
the roll.
The duration of the polymorph depends on
the degree of the change. There are three basic
kingdoms of all things—animal, vegetable, and
mineral. If an object is polymorphed to one of a
nearby kingdom (animal-vegetable, vegetable-
mineral) the spell's duration is one hour per level
of the caster. If the change is from animal to
mineral (or the reverse), it lasts for one turn per
level of the caster. If no change in kingdom oc-
curs (for example, if a creature is polymorphed
into some other creature), the change is perma-
nent until removed by a dispel magic spell (at
normal chances for success).
Note that creatures created by means of this
spell are not automatically friendly. A poly-
morph cannot affect a creature's age or hit
points. (See the 4th level polymorph self and
polymorph others spells for other guidelines.)
This spell will not affect a creature which has
more than 2 x the spellcaster's experience levels
in Hit Dice. For example, a 20th level magic-
user cannot affect a creature with 41 or more Hit
Dice.
Power Word Blind
Range: 120'
Duration: 1-4 days or 2-8 hours (see below)
Effect: Blinds 1 creature with 80 hit points or less
With this spell, the caster may blind one vic-
tim within 120' (no saving throw). A victim with
1-40 hit points is blinded for 1d4 days; one with
41-80 hit points is blinded for 2d4 hours. The
spell does not affect creatures with 81 or more hit
points.
A blinded victim suffers penalties of — 4 on all
saving throws and +4 on armor class. A cleric's
cure blindness or cureall spell will not remove
this blindness unless the cleric is of a level equal
to or higher than the caster of the power word
blind.
Steelform
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Creates up to 500 square feet of steel
This spell is effectively identical to the 7th
level ironform spell. However, the material cre-
ated is of weapon-quality; a swordmaker with
this spell could cast the spell and create a finely-
crafted, high-quality sword in 12 turns (two
hours) or less.
Following the same general guidelines as iron-
form, a steel wall will have an AC of — 10(2) and
about 20 hit points per 1" thickness.
Symbol
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Creates one magical rune
This spell creates a written magical drawing (a
"rune") of great power. There are six kinds of
symbols; the caster must select one when the
spell is memorized. The rune may be placed on
an object (such as a door or wall) or placed in
mid-air. The rune cannot move; if placed on a
creature or moving object, it will remain at that
point when the surface moves (possibly floating
in mid-air).
When any living creature passes over or
through the rune, or touches the object on which
the rune is inscribed, or (foolishly) reads the
rune, the rune's effect takes place immediately
(no saving throw).
There is one exception: a magic-user, and any
other creature which can normally cast magic-
user spells (high-level thieves with scrolls do not
count!), may make a saving throw vs. spells if he
merely reads or touches (rather than passes) the
symbol. If the saving throw is successful, the
symbol has no effect.
All symbols look similar to normal writings.
Six symbols and their effects are given below; the
DM may create others (such as polymorph, tele-
port, charm, geas, etc.).
Death: Slays any creature with 75 hit points or
less; does not affect a creature with 76 hit points
or more.
Discord: The victim attacks allies (if any) or is
otherwise confused (as the 4th level confusion
spell). The effect is permanent until removed by
a dispel magic spell (at normal chances for suc-
cess) or by a cleric's cureall spell.
Fear: The victim immediately runs away from
the symbol, at his Running Speed, for 30 rounds
(as the wand).
Insanity: The victim becomes insane, and can-
not attack, cast spells, or use special abilities or
items. The victim may walk, but must be care-
fully tended or may run away. This effect is per-
manent until removed by a dispel magic spell (at
normal chances for success) or by a cleric's cureall
spell.
Sleep: The victim falls asleep, and cannot be
awakened. The victim will wake normally in
1d10 + 10 (11-20) hours or if dispel magic is used
to negate it (at normal chances for success).
Stunning: Affects any creature with 150 or
fewer hit points. The victim is stunned for 2d6
turns (as the power word stun spell).
Travel
Range: 0 (caster only)
Duration: One turn per level of the caster
Effect: Allows aerial or gaseous travel
This spell allows the magic-user to move
quickly and freely, even between the planes of
existence. The caster (only) may fly in the same
manner as given by the magic-user's spell, at a
rate of 360' (120'). The caster can also enter a
nearby plane of existence, simply by concentrat-
ing for one round. He may enter a maximum of
one plane per turn.
The magic-user may bring one other creature
for every five levels of experience (rounded
down; for example, a 28th level magic-user
could bring five other creatures on the journey).
To bring others, he must touch them, or they
must touch him, while the spell is cast and the
shift is made. Any unwilling creature can make a
saving throw vs. spells to avoid the effect. The
caster must take the others with him—he cannot
send them while remaining behind.
While this spell is in effect, the magic-user
(only) may assume gaseous form by concentrat-
ing for one full round. (If he is interrupted, no
change occurs.) Unlike the potion effect, all
equipment carried also becomes part of the same
gaseous cloud. In this form, the caster may travel
at double the normal flying rate: 720' (240').
While gaseous, the magic-user cannot use items
or cast spells, but also cannot be damaged except
by magic (weapons or certain spells). Also, a gas-
eous being cannot pass through a protection
from evil spell effect or an anti-magic shell.
Ninth Level Magical Spells
Contingency
Range: Touch
Duration: Indefinite (see below)
Effect: Prepares one other spell
This powerful spell acts as a trigger for one
stated magic-user spell; this second spell must be
of 4th level or less that does not normally cause
damage.
While casting a contingency spell, the magic-
user must describe one situation and the spell
which is contingent upon it. When that situa-
tion next occurs, the contingent spell effect trig-
gers automatically and immediately, as if cast at
that time.
Examples of proper use:
"When I am touched or struck by any living
creature that is not a Lawful or Neutral cleric, ex-
cept for my friends Charlie McGonigle and Sally
Silvernose (contingency), then cast charm mon-
ster on the creature touching or striking me
(spell)."
"When I have eight hit points or less and am
about to be damaged (contingency), then cast
dimension door on myself to take me to a desti-
nation one inch above ground level directly up-
ward; or, if that is greater than 360' away, to the
furthest unoccupied area within range that I
have seen within the 12 hour period prior to the
existence of this contingency (spell effect)."
No item or creature can have more than one
contingency spell cast on it; not even a wish can
allow multiple applications. The contingency
described can be as detailed or as simple as de-
sired, but is somewhat limited in effect: It must
pertain to something within 120' of the trigger-
ing event. A contingency based on a far-off oc-
currence is beyond the spell's capacity. The
target and effect of the secondary spell must al-
ways be specified, and if any necessary details are
lacking, the secondary spell does not occur.
A contingency spell effect has no maximum
duration. It may remain for centuries before the
situation described comes to pass.
Create Any Monster
Range: 90'
Duration: 3 turns
Effect: Creates one or more monsters
This spell is similar to the 7th level spell create
normal monsters and the 8th level spell create
magical monsters, but with fewer limitations on
the types of creatures appearing.
The range and duration are triple those of the
7th level version. The spell cannot create hu-
mans and demihumans, but can create any other
creature, regardless of the number of special
abilities (asterisks). However, if the caster wants
to create a creature with three or more asterisks,
the caster must have carefully studied one (either
alive or dead) for at least one hour to be able to
create another with this spell. As with the lesser
spells, the maximum number of Hit Dice of
creatures is equal to the level of the caster.
To create a construct (as described in Chapter
14), the caster must obtain the proper materials
necessary to create the construct. The spell will
create only one construct, regardless of the cast-
er's Hit Dice; but it is permanent, and does not
vanish at the end of the spell duration. (How-
ever, a dispel magic spell, with normal chances
of success, can destroy this type of construct.)
As with the 8th level spell, the cost of materi-
als required to create a construct is a minimum
of 5,000 gold pieces per asterisk (or more, de-
pending on your campaign). If the construct has
four or more asterisks (such as a drolem), the cost
is doubled (or more; ask your DM). Chapter 16
contains more rules for enchanting magical
items (including constructs), and has suggestions
regarding nondispellable constructs.
Created monsters of all types can be blocked
by a protection from evil or anti-magic shell spell
effect.
Gate*
Range: 30'
Duration: 1d10 x 10 (1-100) turns or 1 turn
Effect: Opens a portal to another plane
When the magic-user casts this spell, he must
name one target: the Ethereal Plane, the Astral
Plane, one of the four elemental planes, or one
outer plane. He must also name a resident of
that plane, usually that of an Immortal, a ruler
of the plane. The spell opens a direct connection
to the other plane of existence.
A gate to an outer plane remains open for only
one turn. Any other gate remains open for
1d10 x 10 (1-100) turns, and there is a 10%
chance per turn that some other-planar creature
will wander through the gate while it is open.
A gate to an elemental plane actually creates a
vortex and a wormhole, and a wish may be used
to make them permanent. Planes, vortexes, and
wormholes are described in Chapter 18.
Contact with an outer plane is dangerous, and
the magic-user must know and speak the name
of the Immortal he wishes to contact. The Im-
mortal he calls will probably (95% chance) arrive
in 1d6 rounds, but there is a 5% chance that
some other being from the outer planes will re-
spond. When the being arrives, it immediately
looks for the spellcaster.
If the caster does not have an excellent reason
for opening the gate, the being will probably de-
stroy the caster. Even if the caster provides an ex-
cellent reason, the being may merely leave
immediately, showing no interest. If the reason
is of supreme importance to the magic-user and
of some interest to the being (DM's discretion),
it may actually help for a short time.
The reverse of this spell, close gate, will close a
gate created by normal form of the spell. It can
also be used to close a permanent gate to a near-
by plane (such as an elemental vortex). But the
spell cannot affect an Immortal; it cannot, for
instance, make him leave if he chooses to stay.
Heal
Range: Touch (one creature)
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Cures anything
This spell's effect is identical to that of the 6th
level cleric spell cureall. When used to cure
wounds, it cures nearly all of the damage, leav-
ing only 1d6 points of damage remaining. It can
instead remove a curse, neutralize a poison, cure
a disease, cure blindness, or even remove a
feeblemind effect.
Immunity
Range: Touch (one creature)
Duration: One turn per level of the caster
Effect: Bestows immunity or resistance to some
spells and weapons
This spell gives the recipient total immunity
to all 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd level spells. Further-
more, 4th- and 5th level spells have only half
normal effect, or one-quarter normal if the vic-
tim makes a successful saving throw. Any spell
effect that is quantifiable is reduced in effect;
these effects include reductions in duration, bo-
nuses, penalties, damage, etc. Round fractions
off in the recipient's favor.
The recipient is also completely immune to all
missiles (normal or magical), as well as normal
and silver weapons; he takes half damage from
magical hand-held weapons. This applies only to
weapons; claws, bites, breath weapons, and oth-
er natural attack forms are not blocked.
By concentrating, the recipient can drop the
protection, allowing spells (such as cure wounds)
to have normal effects for that round. If
dropped, the immunity is absent for one round
(including the protection from weapons), but re-
turns automatically at the end of the round.
A carefully worded wish spell can extend this
protection, giving immunity to 4th level spells
and + 1 weapons, and half normal effect from
5th and 6th level spells. No further improve-
ments are possible.
Maze
Range: 60'
Duration: See below (1d6 turns, 2d20 rounds,
2d4 rounds, or 1d4 rounds)
Effect: Traps one creature
This spell creates an indestructible maze in
the Astral Plane and places one victim into the
maze (he gets no saving throw). The intelligence
of the victim determines the time he needs to es-
cape the maze.
Maze Duration

Time Required

1d4 (1-4) rounds
Genius (18 + )
When he escapes the maze, the victim returns
to the exact place from which he originally disap-
peared.
Meteor Swarm
Range: 240'
Duration: Instantaneous
Effect: Creates four or eight meteor-fireballs
This spell creates either 4 or 8 meteors (at the
caster's choice). Each meteor can be aimed at a
different target within range, but only one me-
teor can be aimed at any one creature. Each me-
teor slams into its target and explodes like a
fireball (affecting all creatures within a 20' radi-
us).
If the caster creates four meteors, each strikes
for 8d6 (8-48) points of damage and then ex-
plodes for 8d6 (8-48) points of fire damage. If
the caster creates eight smaller meteors,
strikes for 4d6 (4-24) points and then exp
for 4d6 more points of fire damage. Note t
the meteors are aimed accurately, a victim o
might find itself within overlapping blasts

"strike" damage (no saving throw). Each v

fiery explosions. A separate saving throw

Power Word Kill
Range: 120'
Duration: Instantaneous
Effect: Slays or stuns one or more creatures
This spell enables the caster to affect one or
more victims within 120' (no saving throw). Ex-
ception: A magic-user, and any creature which
can cast magic-user spells, may make a saving
throw vs. spells to avoid this effect, with a -4
penalty to the roll.
A single victim with 1-60 hit points is auto-
matically slain; one with 61-100 hit points is
stunned (as power word stun) and unable to act
for 1d4 turns. No creature with 101 or more hit
points is affected.
The spell can also be used to slay up to five
victims if each has 20 hit points or less (again, no
saving throw).

Prismatic Wall
Range: 60'
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: Creates a multi-colored barrier

   This spell creates a barrier of many colors
a glittering appearance as if from light sh
through a prism. This wall is 2" thick, with
between the colors. The effect must be eit
sphere with a radius of 10', centered on the
er, or a flat surface (vertical or horizontal)
to 500 square feet in area.
   Whatever its form, the prismatic wall ca
be moved (even by a wish). The caster may

he chooses to carry. All other creatures an
jects contacting or passing through the pris
wall are affected by its magic, starting wit

be able to pass through the wall, but the attempt
will not damage either the anti-magic shell or
the prismatic wall.
The prismatic wall extends into the nearest
plane of existence (the Ethereal Plane, if cast on
the Prime Plane), appearing there as an inde-
structible solid wall. Planar and dimensional
travel can therefore not bypass it.
The colors and effects of a prismatic wall are
always the same; when created, the violet side is
always closest to the caster. The effects and colors
of the prismatic wall are summarized below.

Shapechange
Range: 0 (caster only)
Duration: One turn per level of the caster
Effect: Caster may change form
This spell is similar to the 4th level polymorph
self spell, but is far more powerful. The caster
actually becomes another creature or object in all
respects except the mind, hit points, and saving
throws. The caster takes his new armor class, at-
tack rolls, special attack forms, immunities, and
all other details from the form he has taken.
A magic-user cannot cast spells in any form ex-
cept that of a bipedal humanoid (demihuman,
goblin, ogre, giant, etc.). The caster cannot take
a completely unique form (such as that of a spe-
cific character, Elemental Ruler, or Immortal).
He can gain the likeness but not the abilities of
another character class. When wearing another
form, he can only cast spells from his own mem-
ory; he cannot cast from scrolls or his spell book.
He cannot assume huge inanimate forms; if he
tries to, the form will be a maximum of one foot
tall per experience level of the caster and 100 cn
weight per level.
Except for these limits, the caster can become
any creature or object that he or she has ever
seen. Imaginary or unfamiliar creatures cannot
be used; unless there are ten-armed trolls in your
campaign, for example, he cannot turn into one.
The caster may change shape at will during the
spell's duration; each change requires a full
round of concentration.
Note that the caster does assume the flaws of
the new form as well as its strengths. If, for ex-
ample, the caster is struck by a sword +2, +5 vs.
dragons while in dragon form, the +5 bonus ap-
plies against his new form.
This spell effect cannot be made permanent and
is subject to dispel magic. During the spell dura-
tion, the caster cannot pass through any protec-
tion from evil or anti-magic shell spell effect.

Timestop
Range: 0 (caster only)
Duration: 2-5 rounds
Effect: Allows caster to act for 1d4 + 1 (2-5)
rounds while everything else "stops"
To the caster, this spell seems to stop time. It
speeds the caster so greatly that all other crea-
tures seem frozen at their normal speeds, in
"normal time." From the caster's point of view,
the effect lasts for 1d4 + 1 (2-5) rounds. The cast-
er may perform one action during each of these
magical rounds.
Normal and magical fire, cold, gas, etc. can
still harm the caster. While the timestop is in ef-
fect, however, other creatures are invulnerable to
the caster's attacks and spells. Spells with dura-
tions other than "instantaneous" may be cre-
ated and left to take effect when time resumes.
Note that no time elapses while this spell is in
effect; durations of other spells cast start after
the timestop ends.
The spellcaster cannot move items held by
those in "normal time," but can move other
items that are not "stuck," including those worn
or carried by others. The caster is completely un-
detectable by those in "normal time." However,
the magic-user cannot pass through a protection
from evil or anti-magic shell while under this
spell's effect.

Wish
Range: Special
Duration: Special
Effect: Special

  A wish is the single most powerful sp
magic-user can have. It is never found
scroll, but may be placed elsewhere (in a
for example) in rare cases. Only magic-use
36th level and with an 18 (or greater) Wi
score may cast the wish spell.
   Wording the Wish: The player must sa
write the exact wish his character makes.
wording is very important. The wish will us
follow the literal wording, and whatever th
tentions of the magic-user.
  The DM should try to maintain game bala

Prismatic Wall

Range: 60!

Duration: 6 turns

Effect: Creates a multi-colored barrier

This spell creates a barrier of many colors with
a glittering appearance as if from light shining
through a prism. This wall is 2" thick, with 1/8"
between the colors. The effect must be either a
sphere with a radius of 10', centered on the cast-
er, or a flat surface (vertical or horizontal) of up
to 500 square feet in area.

Whatever its form, the prismatic wall cannot
be moved (even by a wish). The caster may pass
through it freely and unharmed, with any items
he chooses to carry. All other creatures and ob-
jects contacting or passing through the prismatic
wall are affected by its magic, starting with the
first color they contact.

It takes powerful magic to break through the
wall. A wish spell or a rod ofcancellation will re-
move the three outermost remaining colors, but
that's all.

To break through a prismatic wall, an attacker
must attack it with a specific sequence of spells.
Each spell will cancel one color of the prismatic
wall. These remedy spells, shown on the chart
below, must be cast in the correct order (first,
any magical cold to remove the red layer; then,
any magical lightning to remove the orange lay-
er; and so on). When cast successfully, each spell
causes the appropriate color to disappear from
the wall. When all layers are gone, so is the wall.

A person with an active anti-magic shell (in-

[RC page 60 bbox-2 OCR: end of spell, column 2 top]
including the caster of the prismatic wall) will not
be able to pass through the wall, but the attempt
will not damage either the anti-magic shell or
the prismatic wall.
The prismatic wall extends into the nearest
plane of existence (the Ethereal Plane, if cast on
the Prime Plane), appearing there as an inde-
structible solid wall. Planar and dimensional
travel can therefore not bypass it.
The colors and effects of a prismatic wall are
always the same; when created, the violet side is
always closest to the caster. The effects and colors
of the prismatic wall are summarized below.

Monster Spellcasters
The use of magical spells is not limited to hu-
mans and elves. Many humanoid races have their
own magic-users, clerics, and even druids. A
nonhuman cleric or druid is known as a shaman,
and a nonhuman magic-user as a wokan. Sha-
mans and wokani do not know all the usual
spells. The spells they do know they often cast in
an unusual manner, involving dancing,
shouts and howls, and waving strange items.
The nonhuman spellcasters that are known
are listed below (under "Maximum Spellcaster
Ability"), along with the maximum levels at-
tainable by each. Some individuals may be
both classes (a shaman/wokan), but then the
maximum level for each class is then half what
is listed.
Note that most nonhumans in a tribe or lair
know nothing of magic, and may fear or distrust
it; only the rare shamans and wokani know how
to use it. These spellcasters often use their skills
to rise to positions of power within their tribes.
Only one nonhuman in 20 is a Spellcaster, and
many groups have no wokani, only a shaman.
The spells usable by shamans and wokani are
listed below (under "Spells Usable by Shamans"
and "Spells Usable by Wokani"). Shamans and
wokani do not know, and cannot learn, spells
other than these. Shamans and wokani cannot
read scrolls, but may use other magical items. A
shaman can use any clerical item; a wokan can
use any item usable by a magic-user.
A shaman or wokan normally has 3-8 hit
points per Hit Die (1d6 + 2 instead of 1d8), and
gains a + 1 hit point bonus per spellcaster expe-
rience level (even if the total exceeds the normal
maximum for the monster type).
Important Note: The table below, for the
most part, does not list monsters that can cast
spells as full members of the appropriate character classes—for instance, men, liches, devilfish,
sphinxes, etc. Such creatures are not limited to
the spell lists for shamans and wokani.

Notes:
[a] This monster's special spell-like abilities are not affected by the monster having spells.
[b] Some dragons use magic-user spells, but no single dragon can use both clerical and magic-user
spells,

[c] Manscorpion clerics have access to all clerical spells, and are actually clerics, not shamans.
[d] A nixie who learns spells of any type is counted as five nixies for purposes of the special nixie
charm effect.
[e] Some very rare and exceptionally intelligent ogres can rise to W12, but these types usually live
entirely separated from their normal kin.
[f] A treant who gains the use of druid spells may animate four trees instead of two.
[g] At the DM's discretion, a vampire spellcaster can be a full magic-user or cleric, not limited to
the shaman/wokan spell lists below.

For example, an ogre could learn magic as a
shaman up to 4th level (acting as a 4th level cleric) or as a wokan up to 2nd level (acting as a 2nd
level magic-user); or, he could learn both (acting
as a 2nd level cleric and a 1st level magic-user).

Special Monster Spellcasters
Lycanthropes
A lycanthrope may be a real magic-user, cleric,
or druid in human form. However, it may not
use any spells while in were-form and, when it
assumes were-form, most lose all memory of
spells learned, as if all the spells had been cast. A
devil swine spellcaster can cast three charm per-
son spells per day in either were or human form,
but can only cast other spells while in human
form. Devil swine will not forget spells while in
were-form: When they return to human form,
all their memorized spells are still with them.
Undead Spellcasters
A spellcaster slain by an undead may retain
the use of spells after returning as an undead.
Several undead Spellcasters are listed above and
in the main Monster List.
If a cleric becomes a mummy (through a proc-
ess known only to the ancient high priests of cer-
tain religions), the undead mummy may use
clerical spells to the full extent possessed in life,
and may control other undead as well (see Lieges
and Pawns). A mummy magic-user is limited to
3rd level ability, even if it had higher level spell
use in its previous life.
Undead Lieges and
Pawns
Under certain conditions, intelligent undead
creatures can try to control other undead. The
undead need not be a spellcaster to control other
undead creatures.
An undead creature being controlled by an-
other is a pawn. An undead controlling one or
more lesser undead is a liege. Skeletons and
zombies can only be pawns, but any other type
of undead can be either a liege or a pawn. Ran-
dom encounters with undead may occasionally
(10% chance) be with pawns controlled by a
greater undead creature.
A liege may control a number of undead
whose total Hit Dice are less than or equal to
twice the liege's Hit Dice. If an attempt by the
liege to control other undead would cause the to-

### Spell-Adjacent Procedures and DM Spell Doctrine

- Extraction note: cropped RC extraction from pages 144-147, using bounded page windows plus cleanup to isolate named spell-adjacent doctrine blocks while excluding nearby generic DM advice and dungeon-operation procedures.

```text
[RC page 144: Charm Person Spells]
Charm Person Spells
   Whenever a magic-user or elf casts a charm
person spell, the player will ask you for the ef-
fect. This spell will only affect certain creatures.
The beginning player will try it on many differ-
ent monsters, and learn by trial and error.
   Generally, the creatures affected by a charm
person spell are classified as "humanoid" in
Chapter 14—those that are "normal" human,
demihuman, giant-size humans, or human-like
creatures that have some sort of society.
   Once a victim fails the saving throw against
the charm, the creature will remain charmed for
at least 24 hours, and often longer. The victim
may make a new saving throw to break the
charm each time the controlling character places
the charmed character in a dangerous situation,
without himself being in that danger, or after a
given duration. This duration is determined by
the victim's intelligence and is stated on the Du-
ration of Charm Table.
   Humans, dwarves and halflings may have any
intelligence score from 3 to 18. Elves always have
an Intelligence score of 9 or better, and magic-
users normally have an Intelligence score of 13 or
better. When randomly determining a human's
intelligence, roll 3d6 for most humans, 2d6 + 6
for elves (treating any result of 8 as a 9), and
1d6 + 12 for magic-users.

[RC page 145: Duration of Charm Table continuation]
 Duration of Charm Table
 (Frequency of New Saving Throws)
    Intelligence       Save after
    0                   120 days
    1                  90 days
    2                  60 days
    3                  45 days
    4-5                30 days
    6-8                15 days
    9-12               7 days
    13-15              3 days
    16-17              24 hours
    18                 8 hours
    19                 3 hours
    20                 1 hour
    21+               1 turn

  Some lycanthropes can be charmed when in
human form, but this is nearly useless: Only
werewolves and wereboars are affected and the
charm will automatically be broken when the
creature assumes animal form!

[RC page 145: Damage to Magical Items]
Damage to Magical
Items
Any item may be damaged by rough treat-
ment. Armor and weapons, however, are made
to withstand a great amount of punishment.
The DM should decide whether an item
might be damaged, based on the item and the
type of attack and then would make an item
damage roll.
Some breath weapons (acid, fire, cold) should
require such checks. If the user makes his saving
throw against the breath weapon, magical bo-
nuses can be applied to the item's roll.
Long falls (100' or more) should require
checks. Pools of acid, rockslides, and other cases
of extreme damage should require checks for
items carried. A scroll normally need not be
checked except against fire damage; you may al-
so include water damage, if desired.
To check for damage to items, roll 1d4 or 1d6
(using 1d6 if the chance of damage is hig h ) . I f
the result is greater than the item's Strength
(number of "plusses"), the item is damaged.
Items without plusses may be given ratings for
this purpose. Consider:
any potion or scroll as a +1 item;
any wand or staff as a +2;
and all permanent items (such as rods, rings,
and miscellaneous items) as +3.
This roll may be modified; for example, if a
character is hit by a rockslide, Dexterity adjust-
ments could be applied to the rolls. If a character
tries to break something, Strength adjustments
could be applied. No adjustment should be
greater than +2. However, adjustments to the
chance of survival can be any number of subtrac-
tions from the roll. A potion bottle dropped
from a tabletop might require a check for break-
age, but with a - 2 adjustment (thus, only a roll
of 4 indicates breakage).

[RC page 145: Damage to Magical Items continuation]
If an item is damaged, it may either be parti-
ally damaged or completely destroyed. For items
with magical bonuses, one or more points may
be lost due to damage (DM's choice). Potions
and scrolls should be completely destroyed by
any severe damage.

[RC page 147: Haste Spell]
Haste Spell
  There are many magical ways for creatures to
move and fight at greater than normal speed;
the most common is the haste spell. The follow-
ing rules apply in such situations.

1. Saving throws are never affected by speed
   differences.
2. Hit rolls gain a + 2 bonus for each speed dif-
   ference. A hasted character who drinks a po-
    tion of speed thus gains a total bonus of + 4
   to all attack rolls against opponents moving
   at normal speed, but only a + 2 bonus
   against singly hasted opponents. This bonus
   only affects hit rolls, not damage rolls.
3. The armor class of a hasted creature is not dif-
   ferent from its AC at normal speed, but it re-
   ceives a -2 AC bonus for the next speed
   effect. Thus, a fighter wearing plate mail and
   shield (AC 2) is treated as AC 0 if "double-
   speeded" (such as from both the potion and
   the spell).
4. Wands, staves, rods, spells, and other magi-
   cal effects are not affected by speed. Magic
   always takes standard time to use, without
   bonuses or penalties for speed effects.
5. A maximum of two different types of speed
   may be cumulative. For example, if a charac-
   ter drinks a potion of speed and is hasted, the
   character moves at four times normal rate—
   twice normal from the potion, and twice nor-
   mal from the spell. Four times normal is the
   maximum possible rate increase; attempts at
   "triple speeding" or faster rates always fail.
   For every level of speed, double the number
   of attacks the character can make that round.
6. Identical types of speed are not cumulative.
   If a haste spell is cast on a character who is
   already under the influence of another haste
   spell, the second spell has no effect.
7. The DM may add other restrictions as de-
   sired. For example, problems in communica-
   tion can develop through speed differences,
   especially when a character moving at four
   times normal speed tries to talk with others
   moving at normal speed.

  Speed can be an extremely valuable tool for
characters in combat. If the bonuses gained by
speed give the PCs too much power, you should
add any controls needed to keep the game bal-
anced and entertaining.

[RC page 147: Magic-User Spell Choice]
Magic-User Spell Choice
When a player starts a magic-user or elf char-
acter, the player will ask you what spells the char-
acter has in the spell book. The magic-user's
teacher is a higher level NPC magic-user, and the
spells come from the teacher. The "spell book"
assumed in the game can simply be a list of spells
kept on the character sheet. You may play the
role of the teacher if you wish, but this may also
be assumed.
This system for spells allows you, the DM, to
keep control of the spells used in the game. For
example, you may wish to avoid charm person
spells. You can avoid it simply by not giving it to
the characters. (You'll have to make sure that the
characters never find a scroll or another magic-
user's spell book with the spell on it, too.)
The first spell given should always be read
magic. This allows the character to read scrolls
found, and would be a basic part of the character's training.
The second spell given to a beginning magic-
user character should be fairly powerful. You
should avoid giving detect magic, light, or pro-
tection from evil as the second spell, as these are
nearly the same as the clerical versions (easily ac-
quired by a 2nd or higher level cleric).
For magic-user characters, good "second
spells" are charm person, magic missile, sleep
(all useful attack-type spells), and shield (a valu-
able protection).
The floating disc, hold portal, read languages,
and ventriloquism spells are useful; however, the
player of a beginning magic-user may feel useless
in an adventure if "miscellaneous" spells (which
includes read magic) are the only ones he knows.
These spells make good "third spells," when the
character reaches second level.
You may wish to give one spell to one begin-
ning magic-user and a different spell to another
beginner. This increases the number of different
spells available to a party. However, be sure to
give spells fairly. Try to give one powerful spell to
each, to avoid complaints of unfairness.

### Scrolls

Scrolls
A scroll is a piece of old paper or parchment
upon which a high-level magic-user, elf, or cleric
has written a magical formula. It is also possible
to generate maps via scrolls as noted on the Mag-
ical Item Subtable: 2. Scrolls; these maps are car-
tographic diagrams of a particular area (often
one where treasure is hidden or lost cities are to
be found).
Some guidelines regarding scrolls are given in
the following text.
Who Can Use: Only magic-users, elves, and
10th level (or higher-level) thieves can use magi-
cal scrolls; only clerics and druids can use clerical
scrolls; and only druids can use druidic scrolls.
Determining Contents: To determine what's
on a scroll, characters must have enough light to
read by. Magic-users and elves must use a read
magic spell to determine what's on a scroll;
thieves, clerics, and druids simply read their
scrolls. In any case, all characters must not read
the scroll aloud unless they also wish to cast the
spell at the same time as they figure out the kind
of spell.
Casting the Scroll Spell: To cast the spell on a
scroll, the character must be able to read the
scroll and must read it aloud. A scroll may only
be used once; the words disappear as they are
read aloud.
Protection Spells: Anyone who can read—not
just spellcasters—may use protection scrolls; the
protection spell disappears as it is read aloud.
Treasure Maps: Anyone who can read—not
just spellcasters—may understand treasure
maps; a character who cannot read may make an
Intelligence check to understand the map any-
way. Such maps do not disappear when read.
Scroll Descriptions
The scrolls listed in Magical Item Subtable: 2.
Scrolls, page 229, are described in the following
text.
Communication: This is actually two scrolls,
one stored inside the other. They are easily sepa-
rated. If a message is written on one scroll, it im-
mediately appears on the other. There is no limit
to the range, as long as both scrolls are on the
same plane of existence. The message may be up
to 100 words in length. If one message is erased,
the other disappears as well. Each message must
be erased before another can be written, and
there is a 5% chance (not cumulative) that any
erasing will destroy the magic of both scrolls.
Creation: The user of this valuable scroll may
draw a picture of any normal item up to
5' x 10' x 1' in size (though drawn much smaller)
and up to 5,000 cn weight. The item may then be
taken off the scroll and used! Magical items can-
not be created nor can any living things, but all
types of armor and weapons, for example, are
quite easily created. The item will vanish either on
command of the creator or after 24 hours. The
scroll can create one item per day only.
Cursed: Unfortunately, when any writing on a
cursed scroll is even seen, the victim is immedi-
ately cursed. No reading is necessary! The DM
must make up each scroll's curse. Examples of a
few common curses include the following:
• The reader turns into a frog (or some other
harmless animal).
• A wandering monster of the same level as
the reader appears and attacks the reader by
surprise (a free attack with bonuses).
• One magical item owned by the reader dis-
appears (the item is chosen or randomly de-
termined by the DM).
• The reader loses one level of experience, as
if struck by a wight. (The DM should roll
again for a first-level character to avoid un-
fair "instant death.")
• The reader's Prime Requisite must be re-
rolled.
• Future wounds will take twice as long to
heal, and healing spells will only restore half
normal amounts until the curse is lifted.
Only a remove curse spell (see Chapter 3) can
remove a curse of this nature. However, the DM
may allow the cursed character to be cured by a
high-level NPC cleric or magic-user, who will de-
mand that the character complete a special ad-
venture or perform a worthy but difficult task.
Delay: This is a scroll of one spell. When cast-
ing the spell from the scroll, the user states an
amount of delay from 0 to 12 rounds. There-
after, if the user carries the scroll, the user has
complete control of the spell when it occurs. If
the scroll is not carried by the user, the spell ef-
fect appears around the scroll itself, affecting the
nearest creature if a recipient is part of the spell
process. The spell does not affect the scroll, even
if it is a fire-type spell. For example, an elf reads
a delay lightning bolt scroll, delaying it 8
rounds, and then puts the scroll away. Eight
rounds later, when the lightning bolt actually
appears, the elf may choose the range and direc-
tion by mere concentration, as if casting the spell
at that time.
Equipment: This parchment is inscribed with
the names of six normal items (which the DM
selects or randomly determines, using the Ad-
venturing Gear Table from Chapter 4). When
any item's name is read aloud, the item appears
within 10' of the scroll; the name disappears.
The item will remain for 24 hours or until the
user commands it to vanish. The name reappears
on the scroll when the item vanishes. Any three
of the six items listed on the scroll can be created
each day.
Illumination: This scroll bears the drawing of
a flame. If the scroll is set afire, it will burn with
a clear light in a 60' radius, lasting for up to 6
hours per day. The burning does not harm the
scroll, but it is nevertheless "normal" fire (and
can be used to light torches, for example). The
flame cannot be extinguished except by water or
on command of the user; no wind, normal or
magical, can cause it to even flicker. This item
may already be lit when found.
Mages (spellcasters only): This scroll is blank;
it is used to identify magical effects. The user
may hold the scroll and command it to identify
any one chosen magical effect within 30'. The
name of the magical spell or effect then appears
on the scroll, along with the level of the caster of
the spell effect. The scroll will identify one magi-
cal effect per day.
Maps to Treasures (Normal, Magical, Com-
bined, or Special): Each map should be made in
advance by the DM. Such maps show a route to
the location of a treasure in a dungeon or a wilder-
ness area. The treasure is usually hidden or pro-
tected by monsters, traps, and/or magic. Based
on the type of treasure given, the DM should se-
lect a challenging monster (who has a similar trea-
sure type) and design the map and monster lair
accordingly. Note that the map may be partially
incorrect, omitting an important detail (such as
the type of monsters, dangerous traps, etc.) or giv-
ing some false information; however, the treasure
mentioned should actually be there. Sometimes
maps are only partially complete or are written in
the form of a riddle. And some can only be read
by a read languages spell.
Normal treasure contains coins and gems but
no magical items, while a magical treasure may
include some coins and a few gems of low value
in addition to magical items. A combined trea-
sure has coins, magical items, and valuable gems
or jewelry in roughly equal proportions. Special
treasure should contain at least one permanent
magical item, such as a staff or sword; these
items should be mentioned on the map.
Mapping: This scroll is blank. When held and
commanded to write, this scroll will draw a map
of an area chosen (that is, the DM accurately
draws the map for the players). The area must be
completely within 100' of the scroll, and it may
be up to 10,000 square feet in size. The scroll has
1 chance in 6 to detect secret doors, but it will
not draw what lies beyond them. The scroll func-
tions once per day.
Portals: This scroll creates a pass-wall effect,
identical to the magic-user spell. When placed
on a surface and commanded to function, the
scroll disappears and a 5'-diameter hole appears
that is up to 10' deep. The scroll does not affect
living or magical things. The hole will disappear
after 3 turns or when commanded by the reader
of the scroll. When the hole disappears, the
scroll reappears. The scroll may be used twice
each day.
Protection: A protection scroll may be read
and used by any character who can read the
Common language. When read, it creates a cir-
cle of protection 10' across that will move with
the reader at its center. It will prevent any of the
given creatures from entering this circle, but it
does not prevent spell or missile attacks from
those creatures. The circle will be broken if any-
one protected attacks one of the given creatures
in hand-to-hand combat.
Four types of protection scrolls are described
in the following text.
Protection from Elementals: This scroll creates
a circle of protection (10' radius) around the
reader. No elemental can attack those within the
circle unless attacked first in hand-to-hand com-
bat. Once attacked, an elemental may attack in
return. The effect lasts for 2 turns and moves
with the reader.
Protection from Lycanthropes: When read,
this scroll will protect all those within the circle
for 6 turns against a variable number of lycan-
thropes. The number of lycanthropes affected
varies according to their type, as follows.
Werebats, wererats, werefoxes
1d10 affected
Wereboars, werewolves
1d8 affected
Wereseals, weresharks
1d6 affected
Werebears, weretigers
1d4 affected
Devil swine
1d2 affected
Protection from Magic: This scroll creates a cir-
cle of protection (10' radius) around the reader.
No spells or spell effects (including those from
items) may enter or leave the circle. The effect
lasts for 1d4 turns, moves with the reader, and
may not be broken except by a wish.
Protection from Undead: When read, this
scroll will protect all those within the circle from
a variable number of undead for 6 turns. The
number of undead affected varies according to
their type, as follows.
Skeletons, zombies, ghouls
2d12 affected
Wights, wraiths, mummies
2d6 affected
Specters (or larger monsters)
1d6 affected
Questioning: The user of this scroll may ask
questions of any nonliving nonmagical objects;
their answers will appear on the scroll. The scroll
will display up to three answers per day. The an-
swers will be given as if the objects were living
beings, but they will be limited to simple obser-
vations as if the objects could see, hear, and
smell. The scroll cannot be used to question liv-
ing or magical things.
Repetition: This scroll appears to be a normal
scroll of one spell, and the standard restrictions
apply to its use. However, 1 turn after the spell is
cast, the scroll creates the same spell effect a sec-
ond time, centered on the scroll or affecting the
nearest creature if a recipient is part of the spell
process. As with a normal spell scroll, any spell
cast from it is then gone; however, another spell
may be written on the scroll if it is of the same
level, and the repetition effect will again apply.
Seeing: This scroll is blank. When held and
commanded to write, it will draw pictures of crea-
tures within 100' in any area chosen by the user.
Up to four different types of creatures can be pic-
tured. The scroll will function once per day, re-
gardless of the number of creatures pictured.
Shelter: This scroll is inscribed with an elabo-
rate drawing of a 10'-square room, lit, with two
beds, a table and two chairs, food and drink for
two on the table, and a pair of normal swords on
the far wall, each hung over a shield. If the scroll
is hung on any vertical surface, the room pic-
tured may be entered and the items used. The
food and drink are pure and will nourish any liv-
ing thing. The swords and shields may be taken
down and used. However, none of the items can
be removed from the room.
If the scroll is taken down, the room cannot be
entered or left, but remains in existence on an-
other dimension. If any creatures are in the room
when the scroll is taken down, the air inside per-
mits survival for up to 24 hours. No creatures so
caught can escape by any means other than a
wish. The food and drink are replenished each
time the scroll is taken down. The room can be
created once per day and will remain for up to 12
hours per use; if not removed in that time, the
scroll will fall down by itself.
Spell Catching: This scroll is blank when
found. It may be used to "catch" a spell cast at
the user. It cannot catch spell-like effects, nor
can it catch device-produced effects (such as
from a wand), but a spell cast from a scroll can be
caught. There are four types of this scroll; roll 1d10 to determine the capacity.

Roll   Capacity
1-4    1st or 2nd level spells
5-7    1st to 4th level spells
8-9    1st to 6th level spells
10     1st to 8th level spells

The user of the scroll must hold it up, like a
shield; no other action is possible while using the
scroll. The user must then make a saving throw
vs. spells, with a +4 bonus to the roll; if success-
ful, the incoming spell has no effect and is in-
stead transferred to the scroll, appearing as a
normal scroll spell. The exact spell caught will
not be known until a read magic spell is used to
identify it.
The scroll can only hold one spell at a time; the
spell caught must either be used or copied into a
spell book (magic-user spells only) before the
scroll can catch another spell. Any type of spell
(magical, clerical, or druidic) can be caught as
long as the level does not exceed the scroll's capac-
ity. The scroll of spell catching cannot affect spells
of levels greater than the given capacity, and it can
catch a maximum of one spell per day.
Spells: Use Spell Scrolls in the magical item
subtable for scrolls to find the exact spell levels
or choose spells as appropriate. Spell scrolls are
good ways to introduce new spells in a cam-
paign, and they may thus be designed with the
characters' current spell books in mind. Note
that only druids can cast spells on druid scrolls,
though the spell name can be revealed by a read
magic spell.
Trapping: This scroll can create one trap. The
type of trap differs by the placement of the
scroll. The scroll is destroyed when the trap is
created. If placed on a floor, a hidden pit trap is
created; if on a ceiling, a falling block trap ap-
pears. On walls, a poison dart or gas trap will be
created. The exact trap is left for the DM's de-
sign. The trap created is quite real and is not illu-
sory or magical.
Truth: This scroll is blank when found. The
user may ask a question of any living being with-
in 30'; the complete and true answer appears on
the scroll, read from the victim's mind by a pow-
erful version of ESP. Note that the answer is true
only within the limits of the victim's knowledge.
The scroll will display one answer per day.

### Spell Research

- Extraction note: cropped RC page-255 extraction preserving both the research procedure and the adjacent enchantment-economics doctrine (`Experience from Spells and Enchanted Items`) from the source page rather than a hand-reconstructed summary.

```text
[RC page 255: Spell Research and enchantment-economics doctrine]
Spell Research
A cleric, magic-user, elf, or druid—even a pal-
adin or an avenger in rare instances—can try to
invent new spells and create new magical items
through research. These are difficult and lengthy
projects. For clerics and druids, substitute the
Wisdom scores for Intelligence scores in the pro-
cedures that follow.
Player Procedures
When a player wishes for his spellcasting char-
acter to create a new spell, he first informs his
DM of his desire. Then, following the format
shown in Chapter 3, he writes up his spell as he
envisions it working. He does not indicate its
spell level.
The DM then evaluates the spell as it is writ-
ten up, indicates which spell level he or she
thinks it should be, and suggests any changes
that the player must make to the spell write-up.
If the spell level chosen is higher than the high-
est level spell the spellcasting character can have,
the character cannot yet research and develop
the spell; he must either limit it further, until
the DM adjusts the spell level down to that
which the character could cast, or wait until the
character is of the appropriate level to cast the
spell he is creating.
When the player and the DM are satisfied
with the result, go to the following procedure.
Character Procedures
Spell research requires research materials,
components, time, and money. Once these re-
quirements are met, the character can roll for his
chance of success.
Research
To research a spell, a spellcaster must first have
access to a large library such as those that exist in
major cities or those that are in the possession of
powerful wizards or clerics.
The DM will have to decide whether a player
character's library is sufficient to the task—usually
it isn't until the spellcaster is at least 18th level or
is at least 9th level and has rigorously acquired
every spell book and magical research volume possible throughout his career. If the PC's library isn't
adequate, he'll have to get permission from a
school of magic, clerical order, or powerful wizard
or cleric in order to use a greater library.
Components
The spellcaster must then find components
for the development of the spell. These are up to
the DM to determine; on the average, the com-
ponent must come from a monster with HD at
least equal to the spell level (or of similar diffi-
culty to attain), and the monster must have some
appropriate relationship to the magic spell being
developed. For example, red dragon scales
would be appropriate for an explosive cloud,
fresh troll blood for a regeneration, etc.
The spellcaster must have these components
in hand before beginning spell research, and he
must go on an adventure to acquire them; he
can't just buy them from a greater wizard or cler-
ic. There are no limits to this process other than
the DM's and players' imaginations.
Time and Money
The spellcaster must then spend large
amounts of gold during the progress of his re-
search. The total cost of spell research comes to
1,000 gp x the spell level.
Research takes one week for the initial re-
search, plus one day per 1,000 gp spent. At the
end of this time, the DM will tell him to make
his chance of success roll.
If the spellcaster runs out of gold before it's
time for his chance of success roll, he may inter-
rupt his research, leave on an adventure to earn
more money, and come back later to resume his
research; he loses his initial week of research
(he'll have to spend another week to refamiliar-
ize himself with his work), but he doesn't lose
the money he's already spent; those gp are still
counted toward research cost.
Chances of Success
The chance of success to research a spell varies
depending on the spell level researched and
whether it is a new spell (not already appearing
on the campaign world) or a common one (a
spell that other spellcasters know, but which the
PC hasn't been able to learn from them and so is
developing independently).
For a common spell, add the magic-user's In-
telligence score to his experience level and multi-
ply the result by two. Then subtract 3 per spell
level being researched.
For a new spell, follow the same procedure,
except subtract 5 per spell level instead of 3. Re-
gardless of success chances, a roll of 95 or better
is an automatic failure. There is no automatic
success. The chance of success for researching
spells is as follows:
Common spell: ([Int + Lvl] x 2)-(3 *spell
level) = %
New spell: ([Int + Lvl] x 2)-(5 x spell level)
= %
For example, a 5th level cleric with a 15 Wis-
dom researches a common 1st level spell. He has
a ([ 15 + 5] x 2) - 3 = 37% chance of success.
If the initial attempt is a failure, the character
must start over. However, if he tries again, his
next attempt will be at a +5% chance of success.
That +5% is cumulative for each failure he has;
for example, if he fails three times, on his fourth
try he'll have +15% to his chance.
Dangers of Spell Research
The DM should be very careful when letting
players develop new spells. Those that have per-
manent effects and those that increase in power
with character level or have no saving throw can
lead to massive imbalances in a campaign. A DM
should severely limit or forbid any new spell that
could cause such an imbalance.
In most cases, even with spells the DM ap-
proves, consider any new spell introduced to be
"on probation." Test it in the campaign with the
understanding that it may be changed should it
prove hazardous to the campaign.
Experience from Spells
and Enchanted Items
At the DM's discretion, experience points can
be awarded for creating enchanted items and
magical vessels and for doing spell research—
such work does, after all, represent a great in-
vestment in time, money, and effort, which is
the essence of gaining experience. Note, how-
ever, that experience is only awarded for the first
time a character works on a specific type of item.
When a character creates a magical item or
piece of armor, he can get an XP award equal to
the number of gp spent on the item—if the en-
chantment was successful. If the enchantment
failed, he gets no experience from the project.
When a character creates an enchanted vessel,
home, or similar huge magical item, he gets an
XP award equal to 1/3 the gp spent on successful
enchantments going into the making of the
item. He gets nothing for failed enchantments.
For example, a team of magic-users working on
a flying war galley get the experience for the first
galley they successfully create, but not on subse-
quent ones of the same class; they'd get experi-
ence for the first flying castle they made, but not
on subsequent ones of the same approximate size.
These XP awards are divided evenly among all
spellcasters working on the enchanted item; this
is especially important to remember for enchant-
ed vessels, which generate a lot of XP but are
usually worked upon by numerous spellcasters.
Characters do not get experience for spells
that go into the making of the frame (such as
stoneform) or from the nonmagical fittings add-
ed to such vehicles.

### Magic Item Enchantment, Recharging, and Item Damage Procedures

- Extraction note: targeted RC Chapter 16 and procedure-layer addition from the magical-item creation pages plus the dedicated item-damage page, capturing spell-effect requirements, specialist and component requirements, chance of success, enchantment time, multiple-enchantment handling, recharge costs, dispel relevance, and damage/destruction handling for magical items.

```text
[RC pages 250-252: Making Magical Items]
Making Magical Items
At higher experience levels, magic-users and clerics can create magical items. Most characters who create magical items are magic-users. When a cleric is trying to create magical items, substitute Wisdom for the magic-user's Intelligence when using the methods in this section.

To create any magical item, the character must be at least 9th level. Some magical items require the character to be of higher level.

A number of factors need to be considered when making magical items, including spell effects, specialists or skills needed, spell components, enchantment time, and the chance of success.

Spell Effects
The spellcaster must know a spell relating to the magical effect that he wants the object to have. For example, if he is trying to make a flying carpet, he must know the fly spell. If he does not know the spell, he cannot enchant an item with a similar effect.

Specialists or Skills
The spellcaster must hire and work with a specialist who can make the type of physical object to be enchanted, or else personally know the appropriate general skill if those optional rules are in use. The spellcaster and specialist must work together while the item is being created; a spellcaster cannot simply enchant a normal finished object after the fact.

Spell Components
For every spell with which a spellcaster is trying to enchant an object, he must find some sort of rare element or component, typically involving a long or difficult adventure. The DM determines exactly what that component is.

Chance of Success
When a character tries to create a specific type of magical item, success is rolled on d100 using the character's Intelligence or Wisdom, current level, and the level of the spell involved. The base formula is:
([Int + Lvl] x 2) - (3 x spell level) = %

If the character rolls that number or less on d100, he has succeeded in enchanting the item. If he fails, all the gold pieces, time, and materials are lost.

The Process of Enchantment
Once all the spells are determined and all the rare components are assembled, the process of enchantment may begin. Since this process varies for magical items, the Rules Cyclopedia divides the procedure into armor and weapons on one hand and miscellaneous items on the other.

Enchantment Time
Enchantment time is one week plus one day for each 1,000 gp spent on the item. During this time, the spellcaster must be working steadily in the workshop for eight hours per day. More hours will not speed the process. Fewer hours slow it. A break of one or two days slows the process accordingly; more than two days spoils the enchantment and ruins the project.

Multiple Enchantments
If an item has several separate spell effects, the creator must roll a chance of success for each spell effect. Each successful roll indicates the item gains that power. A failure means the corresponding effect is lost and no further enchantments may be added, though earlier successful enchantments remain.

Spells of Variable Power Levels
When creating magical items, spellcasters must conform to the ordinary limits of similar items already found in the game. When in doubt, find an example in the treasure listings and use that as a limitation. When beginning to create magical items, become familiar with the dispel magic spell description; it describes what happens to permanent items when struck with dispel magic spells.

Recharging Items
The cost of recharging items is equal to the original cost of charges: 10% of the initial enchantment cost multiplied by the number of charges restored. Items with charges cannot be recharged beyond the original number of charges they had when they were created.

[RC page 145: Damage to Magical Items]
Damage to Magical Items
Any item may be damaged by rough treatment. Armor and weapons are made to withstand a great amount of punishment, but breath weapons, long falls, pools of acid, rockslides, and other cases of extreme damage should require checks for items carried.

If an item is damaged, it may either be partially damaged or completely destroyed. For items with magical bonuses, one or more points may be lost due to damage, at the DM's choice. Potions and scrolls should be completely destroyed by any severe damage.

To check for damage to items, roll 1d4 or 1d6, using 1d6 if the chance of damage is high. If the result is greater than the item's Strength, interpreted here as its magical toughness or number of pluses, the item is damaged. The text suggests treating a potion or scroll as a +1 item, a wand or staff as +2, and permanent miscellaneous items as +3 for this purpose.

```

### Construct Enchantment and Magical Constructs

- Extraction note: targeted RC Chapter 16 addition from the actual Magical Constructs pages, capturing construct creation prerequisites, spell gates, cost and time, success chance, HD and immunity guidance, healing rules, damage ceilings, reproduction limits, special attacks, and the nondispellable-frame requirement referenced by Create Any Monster.

```text
[RC page 253: Magical Constructs]
Making Magical Constructs
Constructs (magical monsters such as golems and gargoyles) are created much as magical treasures are. For some of the steps listed in this section the DM can refer to the previous section on "Making Magical Items."

Where the text refers to magic-users' chances based on Intelligence, substitute a cleric's Wisdom as appropriate. The spellcaster creating the construct must be of 18th experience level or a level equal to the HD of the construct being created, whichever is greater. If the construct has more than 36 HD, the DM can either refuse to allow the character to create it or can limit its creation to 36th level characters only.

If the construct is to have up to two special abilities (that is, from zero to two abilities), the magic-user must have the create magical monsters spell. (A cleric can use a wish spell for this purpose instead.)

If the construct is to have any special abilities that would give it three or more asterisks, the magic-user must have the create any monster spell instead. A cleric cannot create a construct of this power level.

For information on finding rare components, see "Spell Components" under "Making Magical Items," above.

Costs and Time
Construct cost: 2,000 gp per HD + 5,000 gp per asterisk (as noted in the monster descriptions in Chapter 14).

Once a spellcaster has acquired the rare component, he can begin work on a construct, but he will have to spend a lot of money. The construct cost includes money that goes toward buying the basic materials that make up the construct and buying special, rare, expensive materials that aid in its enchantment.

Constructs, however, only take the same amount of time to create as do other magical items: one week plus one day per 1,000 gp of cost. Like magical items, constructs are also subject to the same time constrictions noted under "Enchantment Time" in the section above on making magical items.

Chance of Success
Once the spellcaster has expended the necessary time and gp on a construct, he can roll to see if the enchantment is a success. His chance of success is somewhat different from the chance for making magical items; it is as follows:
([Int + Lvl] x 2) - (HD + number of asterisks) = %

Example: A Wisdom 18, 20th level cleric wants to create a bronze golem (20 HD, 2 asterisks). She's already gone on her quest to find the essential components, spent 50,000 gp on materials, and spent 57 days in the enchantment process. Now it's time for her to check her chance of success. Her chance is ([18 + 20] x 2) - (20 + 2) = 54%.

If the roll fails, then the enchantment fails, too. The cleric loses all the time, effort, and money she has expended.

Existing vs. New Constructs
When the player wants to create a construct from Chapter 14, look up the abilities of that monster. If the player wants to create an all-new kind of construct, the DM must decide whether to allow this.

If so, the player designs the construct according to the monster statistics format in Chapter 14. The DM then decides whether the construct is possible by looking over the construct's statistics and abilities. If they are significantly better than those of existing constructs that are at similar HD values, then the player should tone them down until they correspond more to the abilities of existing constructs.

New Construct Guidelines
There are some basic guidelines for creating new constructs, as outlined in the following text.

Hit Dice: A lesser construct can have from 1 to 6 HD; a greater construct can have from 1 to 36.

Immunities: Lesser constructs (such as living statues) are immune to poison; gases; charm, sleep, and other mind-affecting and illusion spells. However, they can be harmed by normal weapons. This set of immunities is worth one asterisk (*). Greater constructs (such as golems) are additionally immune to attacks from non-magical weapons. This is worth another asterisk. Some constructs have extra, individual immunities (such as to cold, to fire, etc.), but these vary from construct to construct. Each individual immunity (or group of related immunities, at the DM's discretion) is worth another asterisk, which increases its cost.

[RC page 254: construct continuation and nondispellable frame requirements]
Healing: Constructs do not heal normally; they must be healed by magic. Unless otherwise stated, a construct can be healed by any spell that heals humans and demihumans. However, the DM can substitute another spell that heals a specific type of construct. For example, a construct that is a mechanical monstrosity might be "healed" by a lightning bolt, recovering hit points equal to the damage theoretically inflicted by the spell. It would be immune to that spell in combat, but it would not be healed by ordinary healing magic.

Number of Attacks: A construct can have anywhere from one to four attacks in a round, as the DM decides.

Damage: A construct, in any combat round, can do no more damage in combat than three times its HD in hit points, and it's not inappropriate to limit that damage to twice its HD in hit points. That damage represents the maximum possible damage the construct could roll, and the damage should be divided among all its attacks.

Reproduction: Constructs do not reproduce; there are never "baby gargoyles," for example. For each construct a spellcaster wants to create, he will have to repeat the creation process at the same costs, length of time, and chance of success.

Special Attacks: Some constructs have special, unusual attacks (such as poison-gas breath or crushing hugs). The DM can approve, veto, or modify any special attack chosen by the player creating the construct. Each special attack is worth another asterisk (*) and, as always, each asterisk increases the construct's cost.

The Frame
The entire frame of the construction will have to be enchanted. On a ship, the frame consists of the hull, topdeck, and masts. On a building, the frame consists of all exterior walls and an area of flooring at least as large as the building or complex. The walls may be of wood, stone, or metal; the flooring must be of stone or metal.

The frame must be created through the use of spells that create permanent, nondispellable physical objects. These spells, listed in Chapter 3, include wood form, stone form, and related form spells. Normal building techniques can't make a structure strong enough to stand up to regular moving, so the magic-user must use spells. Interior partitions, such as the floors of a building or interior decks of a ship, may be constructed in the non-magical fashion.

Potions
Some guidelines regarding potions are given
in the following text.
Appearance: Potions are usually found in
small glass vials. Each potion has a different
smell and color—even two potions with the same
effect appear completely different until used. A
character sipping the potion (taking just a taste)
will realize what the potion's effect is; the char-
acter can then label the potion and keep it for
later use. Sipping a potion does not decrease the
potion's effect or duration, although sipping a
poisoned potion will cause the character to suffer
the poison's effects.
Level of Effect: If the range of the potion's ef-
fect is not stated, treat it as if it were a spell cast
by a 6th level spellcaster.
Duration: Unless stated otherwise, the effect
of a potion lasts 7-12 turns. Roll 1d6 + 6 to deter-
mine the potion's duration. Only the DM
should know the exact duration; he or she will
roll for duration and keep track of it when a char-
acter uses a potion.
Dosage: Usually the entire contents of a vial is
a single dose. The entire potion must be drunk
for the potion to have the listed effect. If a po-
tion does not follow this guideline, the text will
inform the DM.
In Combat: Drinking a potion takes one
round.
Multiple Potions: If a character drinks a po-
tion while another potion is still in effect, that
character will become sick and will be unable to
do anything (no saving throw allowed) for three
turns (half an hour). Neither potion will have
any further effect. Certain potions whose effects
are permanent (for example, healing or longev-
ity) do not count toward this restriction.
Control Potions: When using these potions, the
user must see the victims to direct their actions.
The controlled creatures cannot be forced to kill
themselves. The character cannot perform any
other actions while controlling others, and he
may move at up to half normal speed only. A vic-
tim may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid
the control, but the user may repeat the attempt
once per round, on any victim seen, until the po-
tion's duration ends.
Potion Descriptions
The potions listed in Magical Item Subtable:
1. Potions, page 229, are described in the follow-
ing text.
Agility: The user's Dexterity score becomes
18, and the user immediately gains all applicable
bonuses.
Animal Control: The user may control up to
3d6 Hit Dice of animals (normal or giant, but
not fantastic or magical). When the control
ends, the animals will be afraid and will leave
the area if they can.
Antidote: The user becomes completely im-
mune to certain poisons and gains a + 2 bonus to
all saving throws vs. poison. The weakest type of
antidote protects against the poison of all crea-
tures with 3 Hit Dice or less; stronger antidotes
counteract the poison of larger creatures. Poisons
avoided during the duration of the potion (by
successful saving throws) have no effect after the
duration ends.
Roll 1d10 to determine what types of poisons
the antidote protects against.
1-4 Poisons from 3-HD (or lesser) creatures
5-7 Poisons from 7-HD (or lesser) creatures*
8-9 Poisons from 15-HD (or lesser) creatures
10 All poisons
* A potion of poison is normally treated as poi-
son from a 7-HD monster. The DM can adjust
this option as necessary.
Blending: The user may change color at will to
any color, pattern, or combination of colors. Only
color can be altered, but all items carried are af-
fected. The user hidden by this chameleonlike
camouflage can rarely be detected (10% chance)
unless the observer can detect invisible things or
possesses truesight (as the cleric spell) or a similar
ability.
Bug Repellent: "Bug" includes any form of
arachnid (spider, tick, scorpion, etc.), insect
(ant, beetle, fly, etc.), or chilopod (centipede,
millipede, etc.). After using this potion, the user
cannot be touched by any normal bug, and a
giant-sized bug will ignore the user unless the
bug makes a saving throw vs. spells. If the saving
throw is successful, the potion does not affect the
giant bug. The potion adds a +4.bonus to any
saving throws allowed against magically sum-
moned or controlled bugs.
Clairaudience: The user may listen to noises
(including speech) in an area up to 60' away
through the ears of a creature in that area.
Clairvoyance: The user may see an area up to
60' away through the eyes of a creature in that
area.
Climbing: The user may climb sheer surfaces
as if a spider, with only a 5% chance of falling
(checked per 100' of climbing, at least once per
climb).
Defense: The user gains a bonus to armor
class, which lasts for 1 turn only. Roll 1d10 to
find the power of the potion.
+ 1
1-3
+ 2
4-5
6-7

Delusion: The user will believe this potion to
have the effect of any one other potion (roll
again for the fake potion). However, it has no
real effect.
Diminution: Anyone taking this potion will
immediately shrink to 6" in height. He can only
attack creatures smaller than 1' for normal dam-
age. The user can slip through small cracks and
has a 90% chance of not being seen when stand-
ing still. This potion will cancel a potion of
growth without ill effects.
Dragon Control: There are several different
types of this potion, one corresponding to each
dragon type. The user may control up to three
small dragons at once, but the dragons do get
saving throws. Large and huge dragons are not
affected by these potions. The controlled drag-
ons will do whatever is commanded of them ex-
cept cast spells. They will be hostile when the
control ends. Roll 1d20 to find the type of drag-
ons affected.
White (or Crystal)
1-5
6-10
Black (or Onyx)
Green (or Jade)
11-14
Blue (or Sapphire)
15-17
Red (or Ruby)
18-19
Gold (or Amber)
The DM can roll 1d100 and on 01-30 the po-
tion actually affects the gemstone dragon equiv-
alent (crystal instead of white, onyx instead of
black, etc.).
Dreamspeech: If the user speaks to one sleep-
ing or paralyzed creature within 30', the creature
will hear and silently answer as if awake. The
user will hear the responses by ESP and will be
able to understand the language used. The crea-
ture is not compelled to be truthful. Dead and
undead creatures cannot be affected, but cursed
sleeping victims are within the power of the po-
tion. The effect lasts for 1 turn only, and it ap-
plies to only one sleeping or paralyzed creature.
Elasticity: The user may stretch his or her
body, plus all equipment carried, to nearly any
form—flat, long, etc.—to a maximum of 30'
long or a minimum of 1" thick. Items carried
cannot be used or dropped unless they are first
returned to normal form. While in "stretched"
form, the user cannot attack or cast spells, but he
takes half damage from blunt weapons (mace,
hammer, giant-thrown boulder, etc.). The effect
lasts for 1 turn only.
Elemental Form: There are four types of this
potion: Air, Earth, Fire, and Water (equal
chances for each). The user may change into the
form of an elemental (of the appropriate type)
and back to normal form as often as desired
while the potion lasts. Each change of form takes
1 round. While in elemental form, no special
immunities are gained, but the special attacks of
each elemental are usable (see Chapter 14). Note
that a protection from evil effect will not block a
character using this potion. The user's armor
class and hit points do not change. The duration
is 1 turn only.
ESP: This potion will have the same effect as
the magic-user spell ESP. The user can "hear" the
thoughts (if any) of any one creature within 60' by
concentrating for one full round in one direction.
The user can "hear" through 2' of rock, but a thin
coating of lead will block the ESP.
Ethereality: The user can become ethereal
once, at any time during the potion's duration,
and may thereafter remain ethereal for up to 24
hours, returning to the Prime Plane at will. Once
he has returned to the Prime Plane, the potion
will not enable him to become ethereal again.
Fire Resistance: The user cannot be harmed by
normal fire, and he gains a +2 bonus to all sav-
ing throws against fire attacks. In addition, the
user takes less damage from magical and dragon
fire: - 1 point per die of damage (minimum of 1
point per die).
Flying: The user may fly at up to 120' per
round without tiring (as the effects of the magic-
user spell).
Fortitude: The user's Constitution score be-
comes 18, and the user immediately gains corres-
ponding hit points (if any). Points of damage to
the user are taken from the magically gained hit
points first. Damage applied to the user's origi-
nal hit points will remain after the duration ends
until cured by the usual means.
Freedom: The user cannot be affected by pa-
ralysis of any sort nor by hold person or hold
monster spells.
Gaseous Form: Upon drinking this potion, the
user's body will take the form of a cloud of gas.
Anything the user is carrying or wearing will fall
through the gaseous body to land on the floor.
The user will keep control over his body, and he
can move through small holes in walls, chests, and
so forth. A creature or character in gaseous form
cannot attack, but he has an AC of — 2 and can-
not be harmed by nonmagical weapons.
Giant Control: There are several different
types of this potion, one for each type of giant.
The user may control up to four giants at once,
but each giant gets a saving throw. They will be
hostile once the control ends. Roll 1d20 to find
the type of giant affected.
Hill
1-5
6-10
Stone
11-14
Frost
15-16
Fire
Mountain
Sea
Cloud
Storm
Giant Strength: The user gains the strength of
a frost giant. However, the potion has no effect if
a strength-adjusting magical item (such as
gauntlets of ogre power) is worn. Otherwise, the
user inflicts double normal damage with any
weapon, and he may throw small boulders
(ranges 60/130/200) for 3d6 points of damage.
Growth: This potion causes the user to grow
twice normal size, temporarily increasing effec-
tive Strength, giving the ability to inflict double
damage (twice the amount rolled) on any suc-
cessful hit. The user's hit points, however, will
not increase. This potion will cancel a potion of
diminution without ill effects.
Healing: Like the clerical cure light wounds
spell, drinking this potion will restore 1d6 + 1
(2-7) lost hit points or will cure paralysis for one
creature.
Heroism: This potion has no effect on an elf, a
cleric, magic-user, mystic, or thief. However, a
fighter, dwarf, halfling, or normal man (or mon-
ster!) who drinks this potion gains the Hit Dice,
hit points, and all abilities of a higher level char-
acter (or monster) as follows.
Current Level
Effect
Normal man
Becomes a 4th level fighter
Gains 3 levels or Hit Dice
1-3
Gains 2 levels or Hit Dice
4-7
Gains 1 level or Hit Die
8-10
No effect
11 +
All wounds taken during the duration of the
potion—including energy drains—are subtract-
ed from the magically gained hit points and
levels first.
Human Control: The user may control up to 6
Hit Dice of humans at once (normal men count-
ing as 1/2 Hit Die each), similar to the effects of a
charm person spell. The effect has a 60' range,
and the charm lasts only as long as the potion's
duration.
Invisibility: This potion will have the same ef-
fects as the magic-user spell invisibility. The po-
tion will make the user invisible. When a
character becomes invisible, all the items (but
not other creatures) carried and worn by the user
also become invisible. Any invisible item will be-
come visible again when it leaves the character's
possession (set down, dropped, and so forth).
The DM may allow players to divide a single po-
tion of invisibility into as many as six sips, each
of which works normally but lasts only one turn.
Invulnerability: The user's armor class and
saving throws gain a bonus of 2 for the duration
of the potion. If used more than once per week,
the only effect is sickness.
Levitation: Drinking this potion will have the
same effects as the magic-user spell levitation.
The user may move up or down in the air with-
out any support. This potion does not enable the
user to move side-to-side. The user could, how-
ever, levitate to a ceiling and move sideways by
pushing or pulling. Motion up or down is at a
rate of 60' per round.
Longevity: The user immediately becomes 10
years younger. The effect is permanent, does not
wear off, and cannot be dispelled. This potion
will have no effect on any creature forced to
drink it. In addition, age cannot be reduced be-
low 15 (or below midadolescence for creatures
other than humans), and the change cannot ad-
versely affect any ability scores or other abilities.
Luck: This potion makes the user lucky. The
player of the character using this potion may
choose the result of any one roll of his rather
than rolling a random result (an attack or dam-
age roll, saving throw, etc.). Other players' rolls
cannot be affected, nor can the Dungeon Mas-
ter's rolls be affected. The effect lasts for 1 hour
or until the luck is used.
Merging: The effect of this potion is quite un-
usual. The user can permit others to actually
merge their forms with the user's, including all
equipment carried, as if all were gaseous. A max-
imum of seven other creatures can merge with
the user of the potion. The merging cannot be
forced; the user can, at will, prevent anyone
from merging. A creature merged with the user
can leave the merger by merely stepping out. No
creature merged with another (including the
user) can attack or cast a spell, but he may speak.
Damage to the user of the potion does nor affect
those merged.
Plant Control: The user may control all plants
and plantlike creatures (including monsters) in a
30' x 30' area up to 60' away. Normal plants con-
trolled may entangle victims in their area, but
they cannot cause damage.
Poison: Poisons look like normal magical po-
tions. A character who swallows any amount of
this potion, even a sip, must make a saving
throw vs. poison or die! The DM can choose to
have the poison do a specific amount of damage
instead as another option.
Polymorph Self: The user may change shape
(as the magic-user spell) up to once per round
until the potion wears off.
Sight: The user can detect invisible things (as
the magic-user spell) for 1 turn. This will negate
blindness for that time.
Speech: The user can understand any and all
languages heard within 60' and can respond in
the same tongues. A language must be heard to
be used unless already known.
Speed: The user moves twice as fast, can attack
twice per round, and performs other actions ex-
cept spellcasting at twice normal speed.
Strength: The user's Strength score becomes
18, and the user immediately gains all applicable
bonuses.
Super-Healing: This potion acts just like an
application of a cleric's cure critical wounds spell
(see Chapter 3 for details of this spell).
Swimming: The user may swim in any liquid at
the rate of 180' per turn, even if encumbered.
The user cannot sink (or even be pushed below
the surface) unless the encumbrance is over 3,000
en. The ability to breathe water is not granted by
this potion. The effects last for 8 hours.
Treasure Finding: By concentrating, the user
can detect the direction and distance (but not
the amount) of the largest treasure within 360'.
Undead Control: The user may control up to
18 Hit Dice of undead monsters. The undead
will be hostile when the control ends.
Water Breathing: The user can freely breathe
either water or air (as the magic-user spell) for 4
hours.
Scrolls
A scroll is a piece of old paper or parchment
upon which a high-level magic-user, elf, or cleric
has written a magical formula. It is also possible
to generate maps via scrolls as noted on the Mag-
ical Item Subtable: 2. Scrolls; these maps are car-
tographic diagrams of a particular area (often
one where treasure is hidden or lost cities are to
be found).
Some guidelines regarding scrolls are given in
the following text.
Who Can Use: Only magic-users, elves, and
10th level (or higher-level) thieves can use magi-
cal scrolls; only clerics and druids can use clerical
scrolls; and only druids can use druidic scrolls.
Determining Contents: To determine what's
on a scroll, characters must have enough light to
read by. Magic-users and elves must use a read
magic spell to determine what's on a scroll;
thieves, clerics, and druids simply read their
scrolls. In any case, all characters must not read
the scroll aloud unless they also wish to cast the
spell at the same time as they figure out the kind
of spell.
Casting the Scroll Spell: To cast the spell on a
scroll, the character must be able to read the
scroll and must read it aloud. A scroll may only
be used once; the words disappear as they are
read aloud.
Protection Spells: Anyone who can read—not
just spellcasters—may use protection scrolls; the
protection spell disappears as it is read aloud.
Treasure Maps: Anyone who can read—not
just spellcasters—may understand treasure
maps; a character who cannot read may make an
Intelligence check to understand the map any-
way. Such maps do not disappear when read.
Scroll Descriptions
The scrolls listed in Magical Item Subtable: 2.
Scrolls, page 229, are described in the following
text.
Communication: This is actually two scrolls,
one stored inside the other. They are easily sepa-
rated. If a message is written on one scroll, it im-
mediately appears on the other. There is no limit
to the range, as long as both scrolls are on the
same plane of existence. The message may be up
to 100 words in length. If one message is erased,
the other disappears as well. Each message must
be erased before another can be written, and
there is a 5% chance (not cumulative) that any
erasing will destroy the magic of both scrolls.
Creation: The user of this valuable scroll may
draw a picture of any normal item up to
5' x 10' x 1' in size (though drawn much smaller)
and up to 5,000 cn weight. The item may then be
taken off the scroll and used! Magical items can-
not be created nor can any living things, but all
types of armor and weapons, for example, are
quite easily created. The item will vanish either on
command of the creator or after 24 hours. The
scroll can create one item per day only.
Cursed: Unfortunately, when any writing on a
cursed scroll is even seen, the victim is immedi-
ately cursed. No reading is necessary! The DM
must make up each scroll's curse. Examples of a
few common curses include the following:
• The reader turns into a frog (or some other
harmless animal).
• A wandering monster of the same level as
the reader appears and attacks the reader by
surprise (a free attack with bonuses).
• One magical item owned by the reader dis-
appears (the item is chosen or randomly de-
termined by the DM).
• The reader loses one level of experience, as
if struck by a wight. (The DM should roll
again for a first-level character to avoid un-
fair "instant death.")
• The reader's Prime Requisite must be re-
rolled.
• Future wounds will take twice as long to
heal, and healing spells will only restore half
normal amounts until the curse is lifted.
Only a remove curse spell (see Chapter 3) can
remove a curse of this nature. However, the DM
may allow the cursed character to be cured by a
high-level NPC cleric or magic-user, who will de-
mand that the character complete a special ad-
venture or perform a worthy but difficult task.
Delay: This is a scroll of one spell. When cast-
ing the spell from the scroll, the user states an
amount of delay from 0 to 12 rounds. There-
after, if the user carries the scroll, the user has
complete control of the spell when it occurs. If
the scroll is not carried by the user, the spell ef-
fect appears around the scroll itself, affecting the
nearest creature if a recipient is part of the spell
process. The spell does not affect the scroll, even
if it is a fire-type spell. For example, an elf reads
a delay lightning bolt scroll, delaying it 8
rounds, and then puts the scroll away. Eight
rounds later, when the lightning bolt actually
appears, the elf may choose the range and direc-
tion by mere concentration, as if casting the spell
at that time.
Equipment: This parchment is inscribed with
the names of six normal items (which the DM
selects or randomly determines, using the Ad-
venturing Gear Table from Chapter 4). When
any item's name is read aloud, the item appears
within 10' of the scroll; the name disappears.
The item will remain for 24 hours or until the
user commands it to vanish. The name reappears
on the scroll when the item vanishes. Any three
of the six items listed on the scroll can be created
each day.
Illumination: This scroll bears the drawing of
a flame. If the scroll is set afire, it will burn with
a clear light in a 60' radius, lasting for up to 6
hours per day. The burning does not harm the
scroll, but it is nevertheless "normal" fire (and
can be used to light torches, for example). The
flame cannot be extinguished except by water or
on command of the user; no wind, normal or
magical, can cause it to even flicker. This item
may already be lit when found.
Mages (spellcasters only): This scroll is blank;
it is used to identify magical effects. The user
may hold the scroll and command it to identify
any one chosen magical effect within 30'. The
name of the magical spell or effect then appears
on the scroll, along with the level of the caster of
the spell effect. The scroll will identify one magi-
cal effect per day.
Maps to Treasures (Normal, Magical, Com-
bined, or Special): Each map should be made in
advance by the DM. Such maps show a route to
the location of a treasure in a dungeon or a wilder-
ness area. The treasure is usually hidden or pro-
tected by monsters, traps, and/or magic. Based
on the type of treasure given, the DM should se-
lect a challenging monster (who has a similar trea-
sure type) and design the map and monster lair
accordingly. Note that the map may be partially
incorrect, omitting an important detail (such as
the type of monsters, dangerous traps, etc.) or giv-
ing some false information; however, the treasure
mentioned should actually be there. Sometimes
maps are only partially complete or are written in
the form of a riddle. And some can only be read
by a read languages spell.
Normal treasure contains coins and gems but
no magical items, while a magical treasure may
include some coins and a few gems of low value
in addition to magical items. A combined trea-
sure has coins, magical items, and valuable gems
or jewelry in roughly equal proportions. Special
treasure should contain at least one permanent
magical item, such as a staff or sword; these
items should be mentioned on the map.
Mapping: This scroll is blank. When held and
commanded to write, this scroll will draw a map
of an area chosen (that is, the DM accurately
draws the map for the players). The area must be
completely within 100' of the scroll, and it may
be up to 10,000 square feet in size. The scroll has
1 chance in 6 to detect secret doors, but it will
not draw what lies beyond them. The scroll func-
tions once per day.
Portals: This scroll creates a pass-wall effect,
identical to the magic-user spell. When placed
on a surface and commanded to function, the
scroll disappears and a 5'-diameter hole appears
that is up to 10' deep. The scroll does not affect
living or magical things. The hole will disappear
after 3 turns or when commanded by the reader
of the scroll. When the hole disappears, the
scroll reappears. The scroll may be used twice
each day.
Protection: A protection scroll may be read
and used by any character who can read the
Common language. When read, it creates a cir-
cle of protection 10' across that will move with
the reader at its center. It will prevent any of the
given creatures from entering this circle, but it
does not prevent spell or missile attacks from
those creatures. The circle will be broken if any-
one protected attacks one of the given creatures
in hand-to-hand combat.
Four types of protection scrolls are described
in the following text.
Protection from Elementals: This scroll creates
a circle of protection (10' radius) around the
reader. No elemental can attack those within the
circle unless attacked first in hand-to-hand com-
bat. Once attacked, an elemental may attack in
return. The effect lasts for 2 turns and moves
with the reader.
Protection from Lycanthropes: When read,
this scroll will protect all those within the circle
for 6 turns against a variable number of lycan-
thropes. The number of lycanthropes affected
varies according to their type, as follows.
Werebats, wererats, werefoxes
1d10 affected
Wereboars, werewolves
1d8 affected
Wereseals, weresharks
1d6 affected
Werebears, weretigers
1d4 affected
Devil swine
1d2 affected
Protection from Magic: This scroll creates a cir-
cle of protection (10' radius) around the reader.
No spells or spell effects (including those from
items) may enter or leave the circle. The effect
lasts for 1d4 turns, moves with the reader, and
may not be broken except by a wish.
Protection from Undead: When read, this
scroll will protect all those within the circle from
a variable number of undead for 6 turns. The
number of undead affected varies according to
their type, as follows.
Skeletons, zombies, ghouls
2d12 affected
Wights, wraiths, mummies
2d6 affected
Specters (or larger monsters)
1d6 affected
Questioning: The user of this scroll may ask
questions of any nonliving nonmagical objects;
their answers will appear on the scroll. The scroll
will display up to three answers per day. The an-
swers will be given as if the objects were living
beings, but they will be limited to simple obser-
vations as if the objects could see, hear, and
smell. The scroll cannot be used to question liv-
ing or magical things.
Repetition: This scroll appears to be a normal
scroll of one spell, and the standard restrictions
apply to its use. However, 1 turn after the spell is
cast, the scroll creates the same spell effect a sec-
ond time, centered on the scroll or affecting the
nearest creature if a recipient is part of the spell
process. As with a normal spell scroll, any spell
cast from it is then gone; however, another spell
may be written on the scroll if it is of the same
level, and the repetition effect will again apply.
Seeing: This scroll is blank. When held and
commanded to write, it will draw pictures of crea-
tures within 100' in any area chosen by the user.
Up to four different types of creatures can be pic-
tured. The scroll will function once per day, re-
gardless of the number of creatures pictured.
Shelter: This scroll is inscribed with an elabo-
rate drawing of a 10'-square room, lit, with two
beds, a table and two chairs, food and drink for
two on the table, and a pair of normal swords on
the far wall, each hung over a shield. If the scroll
is hung on any vertical surface, the room pic-
tured may be entered and the items used. The
food and drink are pure and will nourish any liv-
ing thing. The swords and shields may be taken
down and used. However, none of the items can
be removed from the room.
If the scroll is taken down, the room cannot be
entered or left, but remains in existence on an-
other dimension. If any creatures are in the room
when the scroll is taken down, the air inside per-
mits survival for up to 24 hours. No creatures so
caught can escape by any means other than a
wish. The food and drink are replenished each
time the scroll is taken down. The room can be
created once per day and will remain for up to 12
hours per use; if not removed in that time, the
scroll will fall down by itself.
Spell Catching: This scroll is blank when
found. It may be used to "catch" a spell cast at
the user. It cannot catch spell-like effects, nor
can it catch device-produced effects (such as
from a wand), but a spell cast from a scroll can be
caught. There are four types of this scroll; roll 1d10 to determine the capacity.

Roll   Capacity
1-4    1st or 2nd level spells
5-7    1st to 4th level spells
8-9    1st to 6th level spells
10     1st to 8th level spells

The user of the scroll must hold it up, like a
shield; no other action is possible while using the
scroll. The user must then make a saving throw
vs. spells, with a +4 bonus to the roll; if success-
ful, the incoming spell has no effect and is in-
stead transferred to the scroll, appearing as a
normal scroll spell. The exact spell caught will
not be known until a read magic spell is used to
identify it.
The scroll can only hold one spell at a time; the
spell caught must either be used or copied into a
spell book (magic-user spells only) before the
scroll can catch another spell. Any type of spell
(magical, clerical, or druidic) can be caught as
long as the level does not exceed the scroll's capac-
ity. The scroll of spell catching cannot affect spells
of levels greater than the given capacity, and it can
catch a maximum of one spell per day.
Spells: Use Spell Scrolls in the magical item
subtable for scrolls to find the exact spell levels
or choose spells as appropriate. Spell scrolls are
good ways to introduce new spells in a cam-
paign, and they may thus be designed with the
characters' current spell books in mind. Note
that only druids can cast spells on druid scrolls,
though the spell name can be revealed by a read
magic spell.
Trapping: This scroll can create one trap. The
type of trap differs by the placement of the
scroll. The scroll is destroyed when the trap is
created. If placed on a floor, a hidden pit trap is
created; if on a ceiling, a falling block trap ap-
pears. On walls, a poison dart or gas trap will be
created. The exact trap is left for the DM's de-
sign. The trap created is quite real and is not illu-
sory or magical.
Truth: This scroll is blank when found. The
user may ask a question of any living being with-
in 30'; the complete and true answer appears on
the scroll, read from the victim's mind by a pow-
erful version of ESP. Note that the answer is true
only within the limits of the victim's knowledge.
The scroll will display one answer per day.
Wands, Staves, and Rods
A wand is a thin, smooth stick about 18"
long; a staff is 2" thick and about 6' long; and a
rod is similar to a wand, but is 3' long. A wand
can only be used by a magic-user or an elf. A
staff can only be used by a spellcaster (sometimes
restricted to a specific type). Lastly, a rod may be
used by any character class.
A wand normally has 2d10 charges when
found and a staff 3d10; the DM rolls the num-
ber, keeps the result to himself, and tracks the
character's use of the wand or staff. If desired,
the DM may use a larger number of charges:
3d10 for a wand, 2d20 for a staff. Rods are per-
manent items that do not require charges. Each
use of a power costs one charge unless noted
otherwise. Each item may be used once per
round at most.
Wand Descriptions
The wands listed in Magical Item Subtable: 3.
Wands, Staves, and Rods, page 229, are de-
scribed in the following text. Note that all of the
wands listed here are usable only by magic-users.
Wand of Cold: This wand creates a cone of
cold, 60' long and 30' wide at the far end. All
within the cone take 6d6 points of cold damage,
but they may make a saving throw vs. wands for
half damage.
Wand of Enemy Detection: When a charge is
used, this item will cause all enemies within 60'
(even those hidden or invisible) to glow, as if on
fire.
Wand of Fear: This wand creates a cone of
fear, 60' long and 30' wide at the far end. All
within the cone must make a saving throw vs.
wands or run away from the user at three times
their normal rate for 30 rounds.
Wand of Fireballs: This creates a fireball effect
(as if using the magic-user spell) up to 240' away.
All victims take 6d6 points of fire damage, but
they may make a saving throw vs. wands for half
damage.
Wand of Illusion: This creates a phantasmal
force effect (as if using the magic-user spell). The
user must concentrate on the illusion to main-
tain it, but he may walk at half normal move-
ment rate while doing so.
Wand of Lightning Bolts: This creates a light-
ning bolt (as if using the magic-user spell), start-
ing up to 240' away and 60' long from that
point. The victims take 6d6 points of electrical
damage, but they may make a saving throw vs.
wands for half damage.
Wand of Magic Detection: When a charge is
used, this item will cause any magical item with-
in 20' to glow. If the item cannot normally be
seen (within a closed chest, for example), the
glow will not be seen.
Wand of Metal Detection: This wand will
point toward any type of metal named if within
20' and if 1,000 cn or more in weight. The user
cannot detect the amount of metal.
Wand of Negation: This wand can be used to
cancel the effects of one other wand or staff. If
the other effect has a duration, the negation lasts
for one round.
Wand of Paralyzation: This wand projects a
cone-shaped ray when a charge is used. The ray is
60' long and 30' wide at its end. Any creature
struck by the ray must make a saving throw vs.
wands or be paralyzed for 6 turns.
Wand of Polymorphing: This wand creates ei-
ther a polymorph self or polymorph other effect
(as if using the magic-user spells). The user must
state which effect is desired. An unwilling victim
may make a saving throw vs. wands to avoid the
effect.
Wand of Secret Door Detection: The user may
find any secret door within 20', using one charge
per secret door found.
Wand of Trap Detection: This wand will point
at all traps within 20', one at a time, at a cost of
one charge per trap found.
Staff Descriptions
The staves listed in Magical Item Subtable: 3.
Wands, Staves, and Rods, page 229, are de-
scribed in the following text.
Staff of Commanding: Usable by all spell-
casters, this magical item has all the powers of
the rings of animal, human, and plant control
(see the individual descriptions under "Rings,"
below).
Staff of Dispelling: The touch of this item has
the same effect as a dispel magic spell from a
15th level caster, but it will affect only the item
or magical effect touched. Any potion or scroll
touched is completely destroyed, and any per-
manent magical item touched becomes non-
magical for 1d4 rounds (including armor and
weapons). This effect may be permanently
harmful to intelligent swords (DM's choice).
Each use of the staff costs one charge. This staff
is usable by any character.
Staff of the Druids: This staff is usable only by
druids. A druid carrying this staff gains one extra
spell of each spell level. The extra spells must be
selected when the usual spells are acquired (usu-
ally during morning meditation). Each day's use
of the staff uses one charge. The staff is a + 3
weapon as well, and it may be used as such (in-
flicting 1d6 + 3 points of damage per hit) with-
out using any charges.
Staff of an Element: Usable only by magic-
users, there are seven types of these staves; roll
1d100 to determine the exact type found.
Staff of Air
01-21
Staff of Earth
22-42
Staff of Fire
43-63
Staff of Water
64-84
Staff of Air and Water
85-91
Staff of Earth and Fire
92-98
99-00
Staff of Elemental Power
Each staff is a staff +2 and may be used as one
without using any charges, striking for 1d6 + 2
points of damage. Staves of two elements gain
all the powers of both staves, and the staff of ele-
mental power has the powers of all four.
Each staff contains the following powers when
used on the Prime Plane:
• A +4 bonus to saving throws vs. attack
forms based on that element.
• Complete immunity to attacks by any ele-
mental of that type.
• The ability to summon one 8-Hit Dice ele-
mental of that type per day (as the magic-
user spell), each summoning costing one
charge.
• Certain spell-like effects, each costing one
charge per use. These created spell effects
are treated as if cast by a 10th level spellcast-
er. The effects are dependent on type of ele-
ment as follows:
Air: lightning bolt, cloudkill
Earth: web, wall of stone
Fire: fireball, wall of fire
Water: ice (storm or wall)
When used on the elemental plane of the cor-
responding type, the powers are quite different.
As long as one or more charges remain in the
staff, the powers granted to the holder are not
the powers given above, but are rather the fol-
lowing powers:
• Immunity to damage from the plane itself,
with vision to 60' range.
• Movement within the plane at the rate of
120 feet per turn (40'/round).
• Communication ability with any resident of
that plane.
• A — 4 bonus to armor class if attacked by a
resident of that plane.
Note that these staves do not provide the abil-
ity to breathe on the plane; some other device or
spell must also be used. However, when a staff is
used along with a matching ring of elemental
adaptation or talisman of elemental travel, all ef-
fects given above are extended to a 10' radius
around the user.
Except for the staff of elemental power, each
staff can be used to negate effects relating to
the element to which it is opposed (see the
Dominance-Opposition Table on page 264), at
the cost of one charge if the effect was produced
by the opposite staff or two charges if a normal
spell was used. For example, a staff of air could
be used to negate a wall of fire spell cast by any
magic-user, at the cost of two charges.
A summoned elemental may be sent back to
its home plane with the same cost of charges
(one if produced by the opposite staff, two if
conjured by spell), but the elemental must be
touched by the staff (possibly requiring a normal
attack roll).
If a staff is ever taken to the plane it is opposed
to, it immediately explodes, inflicting 20 points
of electrical damage plus 1d8 points of damage
per charge remaining in the staff. The explosion
fills a sphere of 60' radius; all creatures within
the effect may make a saving throw vs. spells
with a - 4 penalty to the roll to take half dam-
age. The wielder of the staff, however, gets no
saving throw.
Staff of Harming: Usable only by clerics, this
item functions similarly to a reversed staff of
healing, at the cost of one charge per creature
harmed. It inflicts 1d6 + 1 (2-7) points of dam-
age to any creature touched by the staff (no sav-
ing throw); a normal attack roll may be required.
This is in addition to normal weapon damage
(1d6 points), if applicable.
The staff of harming can also create the follow-
ing effects, with the costs noted. Each effect is
identical to the reversed form of a clerical spell.
Note that the use of this staff is a Chaotic act.
2 charges
Cause blindness
2 charges
Cause disease
3 charges
Cause serious wounds
4 charges
Create poison
Staff of Healing: Usable only by clerics, this
staff will heal 1d6 + 1 (2-7) points of damage per
use. It may only be used once per day per per-
son, but it will heal any number of persons once
a day. It does not have or use charges for healing.
As an option, the DM may add charges to the
staff (in addition to its curing abilities) to create
the following effects, at the cost of the charges
indicated.
1 charge
Cure blindness
1 charge
Cure disease
2 charges
Cure serious wounds
2 charges
Neutralize poison
Staff of Power: This item can be used as a staff
of striking and can also be used to create any of
the following magic-user spell effects (each do-
ing 8d6 points of damage): fireball, lightning
bolt, and ice storm. It can also create a continual
light effect or move 2,400 cn of weight by teleki-
nesis, as the ring. This staff is usable only by
magic-users.
Snake Staff: Usable only by clerics, this magi-
cal staff is a staff +1 and will inflict 1d6 +1
points of damage per hit.
Upon command, the staff turns into a snake
and coils around the creature struck. The com-
mand may be spoken when the victim is hit. The
victim is allowed to make a saving throw vs.
spells to avoid the serpent's coil. Any man-sized
or smaller victim will be held helpless for 1d4
turns (unless the snake is ordered by the owner
to release the victim before that time). Larger
creatures cannot be ensnared in the snake's coils.
The snake's characteristics are as follows.
Snake: AC 5; HD 3; hp 20; MV 60' (20'); #AT 1
(special); Dmg Nil (special); Save C3; ML 12;
XP6
When freed, the snake crawls back to its own-
er and becomes a staff once again. The snake is
completely healed when it returns to staff form.
If killed in snake form, it cannot return to staff
form and it loses all magical properties. This
item does not have or use charges.
At the DM's option, the staff can be given
charges. The user can spend charges to add bo-
nuses to the snake's attack foil ( + 1 bonus per
charge spent); up to five charges can be used in a
single attack (for a + 5 bonus).
A charge can also be used to cure the snake
while it is in combat. The user casts a curing spell
of any type and expends one charge to transfer
the cure to the snake. The amount of curing is
determined normally; no range limit applies.
Staff of Striking: Usable by all spellcasters,
this weapon inflicts 2d6 (2-12) points of damage
per charge if the hit is successful. Only one
charge may be used per strike.
Staff of Withering: One hit from this staff
ages the victim 10 years. One or two hits will be
fatal to most animals and harmful to many hu-
mans. Elves may ignore the first 200 years of ag-
ing, dwarves may ignore the first 50 years, and
halflings may ignore the first 20 years. Undead
are not affected by this item. This staff is usable
only by clerics.
Staff of Wizardry: Usable only by magic-
users, this staff +1 has all the powers of a. staff of
power, plus the magic-user spell effects of invisi-
bility, passwall, web, and conjure elemental. It
may also be used to create a whirlwind (as if from
a djinni) or shoot a cone of paralyzation (as the
wand). In addition, the user may break the staff,
which releases all of its power at once. This final
strike is an explosion that inflicts 8 points of
damage per charge remaining in the staff. All
creatures within 30' (including the user!) take
damage (but all may make a saving throw vs.
staff for half damage).
Rod Descriptions
The rods listed in Magical Item Subtable: 3.
Wands, Staves, and Rods, page 229, are de-
scribed in the following text.
Rod of Cancellation: This rod is usable by any
character. It will work only once, but it will drain
any magical item it hits, making that item for-
ever nonmagical. The target is treated as having
an armor class of 9. The DM may adjust the ar-
mor class of an item if it is being used in combat
(such as when trying to hit a sword).
Intelligent magical swords and + 5 magical
items may resist the effect of the rod if the user
makes a saving throw vs. wands. This merely indi-
cates successful resistance, and the rod still retains
its power. A sword +5 with intelligence, for ex-
ample, gains a +2 bonus to the saving throw.
Rod of Dominion: Usable by any character,
this rod aids in ruling. If a ruler carries it on a
tour throughout his or her dominion, the rod
adds a bonus to all Confidence Level rolls, based
on the percentage of residents viewing it (roll
1d100 for the result).
01-50
+10
51-75
+20
76-90
+30
91-99
+40
+50
When not on display, the rod must be kept in
the ruler's stronghold. The effects last for three
months, but the rod may be shown again to the
populace as desired.
Rod of Health: Usable by clerics only, this rod
has all the powers of a staff of healing, but with-
out expending any charges. It can affect any one
creature only once per day, regardless of the ef-
fect chosen.
Rod of Inertia: Only a dwarf, halfling, fighter,
thief, or mystic may use this unusual item. It
may be used as a spear +3 in all respects. On
command of the user, it will stop wherever it is,
and it cannot be moved by any means except a
wish. A second command releases it. If the rod is
in motion when stopped, it will continue its di-
rection when released. For example, it may be
thrown toward a door and commanded to stop,
later released if an enemy enters so that the rod
will continue toward the enemy (a normal attack
roll is made). If the user falls, a command will
stop the rod suddenly, and the user may hold on-
to the rod.
Rod of Parrying: This rod +5 can be used as a
melee weapon, inflicting 1d8 + 5 (6-13) points of
damage per hit (but no Strength bonus applies).
It may also be used to parry attacks, if the user
chooses this ability at the beginning of a round.
When attacked in melee, the user's armor class
gains a + 5 bonus while parrying; however, this
does not apply to avoiding missile fire. While us-
ing the rod of parrying, no other action is possible
except a Fighting Withdrawal maneuver (see
Chapter 8). This rod is usable by any character.
Rod of Victory: Usable by any character, this
rod makes the user lucky in war (when the War
Machine mass combat system is used). The fol-
lowing bonuses apply to that system:
• A + 25 bonus applies to the Combat Results
roll (to a maximum total of 100).
• On the Combat Results Table, if the differ-
ence in overall totals is 101 or more, the re-
sult for "91-100" is used, limiting the
number of casualties.
Rod of Weaponry: This rod + 5 is only usable
by a dwarf, halfling, fighter, thief, or mystic. On
command of the user, it will elongate and may
be divided into two weapons of the same size,
each + 2. Each of those may be similarly divided
into two + 1 weapons. The rod cannot be di-
vided accidentally, and it can be reassembled
simply by placing the parts together. Each weap-
on, regardless of size, inflicts 1d6 points of dam-
age per hit, plus magic bonuses (but not
Strength bonuses).
Rod of the Wyrm: Usable by any character,
there are three types of this rod; determine the
type randomly or select one.
Dragon
Breath (s)
Alignment
AC
1d10
Lawful
Fire/Gas
Gold
-2
1-5
Neutral
6-8
Blue
Lightning
Chaotic-
9-10
Black
Acid
Each is a rod + 5 and each inflicts 1d8 + 5 (6-
13) points of damage per hit (but without
Strength bonuses). Once per day, the rod may be
turned into a small dragon of the appropriate
type. The created dragon has 30 hit points and
can only be affected by magic (weapons, spells,
etc.). It will understand and faithfully serve the
user of the rod to the best of its ability; for exam-
ple, it can act as messenger, steed, or guard. It
will fight to the death unless commanded other-
wise. The dragon knows no spells. It will return
to rod form on command; if slain in dragon
form, however, it cannot return to rod form and
is forever destroyed. Spells and other magical
forms of healing can be used to heal the crea-
ture, if desired, but not after it is killed.
If a dragon is created by a user of a different
alignment, the dragon will attack the user imme-
diately, fighting to the death. When this occurs, it
cannot be commanded to return to rod form.
Rings
A magical ring must be worn on a finger or
thumb to function. However, a ring may also be
carried and then put on when needed. Only one
magical ring can be worn per hand. If more than
that are worn, the rings negate each other and
none will function, with the exception of a ring
of weakness.
Any ring may be used by any character class,
except where noted otherwise in the text.
Ring Descriptions
The rings listed in Magical Item Subtable: 4.
Rings, page 229, are described in the following
text.
Animal Control: The wearer of this ring may
command 1d6 normal animals (or one giant-
sized). The animals are not allowed a saving
throw to resist control. The ring will not control
intelligent animal species or fantastic or magical
monsters. The wearer must be able to see the an-
imals to control them. The control will last as
long as the wearer concentrates on the animals
and does not move or fight. When the wearer
stops concentrating, the animals will be free to
attack their controller or run away (roll reactions
with a penalty of — 1 to the roll). This ring can
only be used once per turn.
Delusion: The wearer will believe this to be
any one other ring (roll again for the imaginary
type). However, it has no real effect. The wearer
will not be convinced otherwise until a remove
curse is used to dispel the enchantment.
Djinni Summoning: The wearer may summon
one djinni to serve for up to one day. The djinni
will only serve and obey the person wearing the
ring at the time of its summoning. The ring may
be used only once per week.
Ear: This ring, worn on the ear as an earring,
has no effect when worn. However, when re-
moved and placed against any surface (a door,
chest, etc.), the user may hear all noises occur-
ring within 60' of the surface. Light breathing,
heartbeats, and even faint breezes can be heard.
The ring will function three times per day.
Elemental Adaptation: There are seven differ-
ent types of this ring; roll 1d100 to determine
the exact type or select one as appropriate.
Air
01-21
Earth
22-42
43-63
Fire
64-84
Water
Air and Water
85-91
Earth and Fire
92-98
99-00
All elements
The wearer of this ring can, when in the ap-
propriate elemental plane, freely breathe and
see through the gaseous element (the equivalent
of air on the Prime Plane).
Fire Resistance: The wearer of this ring will
not be harmed by normal fires, and he gains a
bonus of + 2 on all saving throws vs. fire spells
and vs. red dragon breath. In addition, the DM
subtracts 1 point from each die of fire damage to
the wearer (with a minimum damage of 1 point
per die rolled to determine the damage).
Holiness: This ring is usable only by a cleric or
druid. If the ring is worn while spells are gained
(usually during morning meditation), the cleric
gains one extra spell each of levels 1,2, and 3 as
appropriate. (Extra spells apply only to spell
levels obtainable. For example, a 5th level cleric
would not gain any 3rd level spells.) If the ring is
removed, the spells are forgotten (though this
has no effect if the spells are already cast). In ad-
dition, a cleric (but not a druid) gains a +1 bo-
nus to any rolls to turn undead, including the
roll determining the Hit Dice of undead turned.
The ring does not affect turn attempts not re-
quiring a roll.
Human Control: This is the same effect as the
potion of the same name. The effect lasts until
canceled by the wearer of the ring, the ring is re-
moved, or until a dispel magic spell removes the
charm.
Invisibility: The wearer is invisible as long as
the ring is worn. If the wearer attacks or casts
spells, he or she will become visible. The wearer
can only become invisible once per turn, but
there is no duration to the invisibility; the wearer
will stay invisible as long as he does not take off
the ring, attack someone, or cast spells.
Life Protection: This valuable ring will negate
the effects of 1d6 energy drain attacks. If the
wearer is struck by an energy-draining undead
(or effect), charges are drained from the ring and
no levels are lost. If a single blow drains more
experience levels than there are charges remain-
ing in the ring, the ring disintegrates; otherwise,
it becomes a ring of protection +1 when all the
charges are used.
Memory: This ring can only be used by a spell-
caster. It allows the wearer to recall any one spell
cast. The wearer must decide, within 1 turn of
casting a spell, to recall it; the memory then reap-
pears and the spell is instantly "relearned." The
ring can restore the memory of one spell per day.
Plant Control: This ring has the same effect as
the potion of the same name, but only lasts as
long as the wearer concentrates.
Protection +1, + 2, +3, or +4: This ring im-
proves the wearer's armor class by 1, 2, 3, or 4, as
listed. For example, a ring of protection +3
worn by a magic-user with no armor (AC 9)
would give the magic-user an AC of 6 while he
wears the ring. This item also adds its bonus to
all of the wearer's saving throws; in the example
here, the magic-user would get a +3 bonus to
saving throws.
A variation of this ring is the ring of protec-
tion + 1, 5' radius. This ring improves the wear-
er's armor class and saving throws by 1 (as a
normal ring of protection +1), but the ring also
gives the same bonus to all creatures within 5'—
both friend and foe! No rings affecting an area
are more powerful than + 1.
Quickness: Once each day, the wearer of this
ring can move and attack at double normal rates
for 1 turn. The effect is identical to the magic-
user spell haste, but this effect can be produced
by command, not by spellcasting.
Regeneration: The wearer regenerates lost hit
points at the slow rate of 1 per turn. The ring
also replaces lost limbs; a finger will regrow in 24
hours, and a whole limb can be replaced in one
week. The ring will not function if the wearer's
hit points drop to 0 or less. Fire and acid damage
cannot be regenerated.
Remedies: Once each day, this ring will pro-
duce one remedy—a cure blindness, cure
disease, remove curse, or neutralize poison spell
effect. Each effect is identical to the cleric spell
of the same name and is treated as if cast by a
25th level cleric. The ring produces the effect de-
sired when the wearer concentrates and touches
the recipient.
Safety: The effect of this ring is similar to that
of a potion of luck. If the ring's wearer fails a sav-
ing throw, his player may "change fate" by an-
nouncing that his saving throw was, in fact,
successful. The ring will negate 1d4 failed saving
throws and then disintegrate.
Seeing: Once each day, the wearer of this ring
can see all things plainly, as if the cleric spell
truesight were cast. The wearer need not be a
spellcaster. The effect lasts for 3 turns.
Spell Eating: Although this ring appears and
functions as a ring of spell turning, it has an extra,
detrimental effect if the user is a spellcaster. After
the spellcaster has cast a spell while the ring is
worn, the ring "eats" all the remaining spells
memorized by the spellcaster. The ring cannot be
removed after it has eaten the wearer's spells
(though spells can be restudied and safely cast)
until a remove curse is applied by a 25th or higher
level spellcaster. This remedy only permits the re-
moval of the ring and does not affect its powers. A
dispel evil cast by a 36th level caster will turn the
ring into a normal ring of spell turning.
Spell Storing: When found, this ring has 1d6
spells stored within it. Those exact spells are the
limit of the ring's powers and they cannot be
changed. When the ring is put on, the wearer
magically knows what spells are stored and how
to use them. After a spell is used, it may be re-
placed by a spellcaster who must cast the replace-
ment spell directly at the ring. The ring will not
absorb spells thrown at the wearer. The spells in
the ring have the duration, range, and effect
equal to the lowest level needed to cast them.
The DM should select the type of spells in the
ring; about 20% of these rings typically contain
clerical spells.
Spell Turning: This ring reflects 2d6 spells
back to their casters (per day) so that the wearer
is not affected by spell attacks. Only spells are
reflected, not spell-like powers of monsters or
spell-like effects from items. Once the ring's
number of spells is reached, it becomes useless
for the rest of the day.
Survival: The wearer can survive without air,
food, or drink while the ring is worn by using the
charges contained within it. The ring contains
1d100 + 100 (101-200) charges when found. By
spending one charge, the user needs no food or
drink for 24 hours. Survival without air requires
one charge per hour. The ring turns black when
five or fewer charges remain.
Telekinesis: The wearer may slowly move inan-
imate objects weighing up to 2,000 cn by con-
centration alone, up to a distance of 50'.
Truth: Three times per day, this ring allows the
wearer to know whether a spoken statement is
true or false. Note that if the person or creature
uttering the statement believes it to be true, a
"true" result will be obtained. By telepathy, the
ring tells the wearer of its powers as soon as it is
worn.
Truthfulness: This item claims to be a ring of
truth when worn (as above), but actually it func-
tions differently. When the wearer first tries to
determine the truth of a statement, the state-
ment will appear to be true—but thereafter, the
wearer will be unable to lie. The wearer must
provide full and completely true answers to any
question asked of him so long as he wears the
ring. He cannot remove the ring until a remove
curse is applied by a 26th or higher level caster.
Truthlessness: This item also claims to be a
ring of truth when worn, but it functions in a
manner opposite that of a ring of truthfulness—
that is, the wearer is unable to tell the truth and
must lie at all times. The ring cannot be re-
moved until a remove curse spell, cast by a 26th
or higher level caster, is applied.
Water Walking: The wearer of this ring may
walk on the surface of any body of water and will
not sink.
Weakness: When this ring is put on, the wear-
er becomes weaker and his Strength score be-
comes 3 within 1d6 rounds. The wearer cannot
take off this ring unless a remove curse spell is
used. If more than one ring is worn per hand,
this ring will still function despite the other
rings' effects being canceled.
Wishes: A ring of wishes is an extremely pow-
erful item. Wishes must be handled very careful-
ly by the DM and the players alike. To find the
number of wishes contained, roll 1d10.
1-4
5-7
8-9
X-ray Vision: The wearer may see a distance of
up to 30', even through a wall and into the space
beyond, by standing still and concentrating. The
effect may be blocked by gold or lead. The wear-
er can inspect one 10' x 10' area per use (which
requires a full turn), and he will be able to see
any traps or secret doors in the area examined.
The ring allows the wearer to see through items
less dense than stone (such as cloth, wood, or wa-
ter) more easily, to a range of 60'. The ring may
be used up to 1 turn per hour.
Miscellaneous Magical
Items
Each of the items listed in this section may be
used by any character class and up to once per
round, unless noted otherwise. Most of the given
effects either work automatically or are activated
by concentration alone.
There is no limit to the many types of magical
items possible; the devices and effects given here
are a mere sampling. The DM may create others
as desired, with nearly any powers as appropri-
ate. However, when designing such items, keep
the balance of the game in mind. If an item du-
plicates clerical powers, for example, it may
cause clerics themselves to become less useful in
the game. Keep such items rare and limit them
by giving them expendable charges, lest they ad-
versely affect the game.
Miscellaneous Item
Descriptions
The magical items listed in Magical Item Sub-
table: 5. Miscellaneous Items, page 229, are de-
scribed in the following text.
Amulet of Protection from Crystal Balls and
ESP: The wearer of this item is automatically
protected from being spied on by anyone using a
crystal ball or any type of ESP.
Bag of Devouring: This item looks like a nor-
mal small sack, but anything placed within it
disappears. Anyone may reach in and find the
contents by touch—if the contents are still there!
If the contents are not removed within 1d6 + 1
(7-12) turns, they will be forever lost. The bag
will not affect living creatures unless the entire
creature is stuffed inside the bag. This is impos-
sible to do except with very small creatures.
Bag of Holding: This bag looks like a normal
small sack, but any items placed within it disap-
pear. Anyone may reach in and find the contents
by touch. The bag will actually hold treasures up
to 10,000 cn in weight, but will only weigh 600
cn when full. An item to be placed inside the
bag may be no larger than 10' x 5' x 3'. A larger
item will not fit inside.
Boat, Undersea: This item appears identical to
a standard riverboat (see Chapter 4) and can be
used as one. As it is magical, however, its armor
class is 4 and it has 40 hull points. It is operated
by a magical command word that its maker
knows; characters who find an undersea bout
may have to go on an adventure to discover the
boat's command word. If the command word is
known, no rowers or sailors are required. The
boat will obey commands to start, stop, turn to
port (left), turn to starboard (right), stop turn-
ing (while keeping the same speed), submerge,
level off, and surface. When underwater, the
boat radiates a water breathing effect, protecting
all passengers and crew as long as they touch it.
The undersea boat can be fitted with grips so
that the passengers can avoid drifting away.
Note: The DM may wish to create similar
magical boats that travel only on ice, sand, in the
air, and so forth.
Boots of Levitation: The wearer may levitate
(as if using the magic-user spell). There is no
limit to the duration.
Boots of Speed: The wearer may move as fast
as a riding horse (240' [80']) for 12 hours, after
which the wearer must rest for one full day.
Boots of Traveling and Leaping: The wearer
needs no rest during normal movement. The
wearer may also make mighty jumps, to a maxi-
mum height of 10' and a maximum length of 30'.
Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals: This
item may be used only once per day. The bowl is
3' in diameter; it requires 1 turn to use. The
bowl will summon a water elemental and will al-
low the user to control it, subject to normal rules
for elemental control.
Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals: This
item may be used only once per day. It requires 1
turn to use and will summon a fire elemental
that will allow the user to control it, subject to
normal rules for elemental control.
Broom of Flying: When verbally commanded,
the broom will carry its owner through the air at
240' per turn. One other person (or up to 2,000
cn of baggage) may also be carried, but the
broom slows to 180' per turn.
Censer of Controlling Air Elementals: This
item may be used only once per day and requires
1 turn to use. The censer will summon an air ele-
mental and will allow the user to control it, sub-
ject to normal rules for elemental control.
Chime of Time: This simple metal stick is 3"
long and made of a silvery metal. On command,
it will keep track of time, chiming every hour on
the hour—the chime can be heard by all within
60' (regardless of intervening walls, rock, etc.). If
dampened by a silence, 15' radius spell, the
chime will dispel the silence but be dampened to
a 30-foot range for that turn.
A second command will cause the chime to
turn color. It will turn gold at one end, the color
slowly spreading to the other end in an hour's
time. A third command word causes the chime
to stop ringing or to stop changing color—but
not until 1 turn elapses after the command.
Crystal Ball: This item can only be used by an
elf or a magic-user. Its owner may look into it
and see any place or object thought about as it
exists at that time. It will work three times per
day, and the image will last for 1 turn. Spells
cannot be cast "through" the crystal ball. The
more familiar the object or area to be seen, the
clearer the picture will be.
Crystal Ball with Clairaudience: This works
like a standard crystal ball, but with the added
power to listen to noises through the ears of a
creature in the area viewed. It is only usable by a
magic-user.
Crystal Ball with ESP: This also works like a
standard crystal ball, but with the added power
to listen to the thoughts of a creature viewed. It
is only usable by a magic-user.
Displacer Cloak: This item warps light rays; the
wearer is actually 5' away from the perceived loca-
tion. The cloak gives a bonus of +2 to the wear-
er's saving throws vs. spell, wand/staff/rod, and
turn to stone attacks. Hand-to-hand attacks on
the wearer are penalized by — 2 on the attack
rolls, and most missile fire will automatically miss.
Drums of Panic: These large kettle drums
have no effect on any creatures within 10' of
them. When used, however, all creatures 10'-
240' away must make a saving throw vs. spell or
run away from the user for 3 full turns. If the
morale system is used, no saving throw is need-
ed, but each creature must make a morale check
instead, with a penalty of + 2 to the roll.
Efreeti Bottle: This item is a large, heavy
sealed jug about 3' high. If the seal is broken and
the stopper pulled, an efreeti will come forth to
serve the opener once per day for 101 days (or
until slain). The creature will return to its home
(the fabled City of Brass) after its term of service
is ended. It will serve no one but the person
opening the bottle.
Egg of Wonder: This strange item is the size of
a chicken's egg, but it may be of any color. An
egg breaks when dropped or thrown (to 60' max-
imum range); in the following round, a creature
emerges from it and grows to normal size, there-
after obeying the thrower of the egg to the best
of its ability. (Note that the creature must be
able to hear the user's commands.) The creature
will disappear after one hour of existence or
when slain. The creature appearing is never de-
termined until the egg actually breaks; characters can never know what creature will appear
beforehand. The DM may add other creatures, if
desired. To determine the type of creature ap-
pearing, roll 1d12.
Baboon, rock
Bat, giant
Bear, black
Bear, grizzly
Boar
Cat, mountain lion
Cat, panther
Ferret, giant
Lizard, gecko
Lizard, draco
Snake, racer
Wolf, normal
Elven Cloak: The wearer of this cloak is nearly
invisible (roll 1d6; seen only on a 1). The wearer
becomes visible when attacking or casting a
spell, and he may not become invisible again for
a full turn.
Elven Boots: The wearer of these boots may
move with nearly complete silence (roll 1d10;
heard only on a 1).
Flying Carpet: This item can carry one passen-
ger at up to 300' per turn, two at 240' per turn,
or three at 180' per turn. It will not carry more
than three passengers and their equipment. As
an option, the DM can say that the carpet will
carry an encumbrance of 6,000 cn, but the
weight of the passengers will have to be calcu-
lated.
Gauntlets of Ogre Power: These gauntlets will
give the wearer a Strength score of 18, gaining all
normal bonuses. If the wearer is not using a weap-
on, he can strike with one fist each round, gaining
a +3 on hit rolls, for 1d4 points of damage.
Girdle of Giant Strength: This item gives the
wearer the same chances to hit as a hill giant.
The wearer does double damage with whatever
weapon he is using.
Helm of Alignment Changing: This item
looks like a fancy helmet. When the helm is put
on, it will immediately change the wearer's
alignment (the DM should determine the new
alignment randomly). This device can only be
taken off by using a remove curse spell, but the
wearer will resist seeking the removal. Once it is
removed, however, the wearer's original align-
ment will return. As an option, the DM may al-
low the character to remove the helm by
performing a special task or adventure.
Helm of Reading: The wearer is able to read
any writing, regardless of the language or magical
properties of the script. This does not allow char-
acters to use spell scrolls unless they can do so nor-
mally. This helm is fragile, however, and will be
destroyed if the wearer is killed. Any hit on the
wearer might (10% chance) destroy the helm.
Helm of Telepathy: This item looks like a fancy
helmet. The wearer of this helm may send mes-
sages, by mere thought, to any creature within
90'. The creature receiving the thought messages
will understand them. (The creature may refuse to
respond.) The wearer may also read the thoughts
of a living creature within range. To make the
helm work, the wearer must concentrate on the
creature, and he may not move or cast spells. If
the creature fails a saving throw vs. spells (or per-
mits the thought reading), the wearer will under-
stand the creature's thoughts.
Helm of Teleportation: Usable by magic-users
only, this helm allows the wearer to teleport (as
the magic-user spell, including chances of error)
himself or to attempt to teleport another crea-
ture or item. An unwilling victim can make a
saving throw vs. spells to avoid the effect. After
one use, the helm will no longer function. If a
teleport spell is then cast upon it, the user can
then teleport as often as desired, up to once per
round, without using charges. However, when-
ever the helm is used to teleport another item or
creature, it again becomes useless, requiring an-
other teleport spell to reactivate it.
Horn of Blasting: This horn creates a cone of
sound, 100' long and 20' wide at the far end,
when blown. Victims within this area take 2d6
points of damage and must make a saving throw
vs. spells or be deafened for one turn; construc-
tions and ships take 1d8 points of damage. The
horn may be blown but once per turn.
Lamp, Hurricane: This item appears and
functions as a lamp of long burning in all re-
spects, but only after its storm has passed, as de-
scribed hereafter.
This lamp is always closed when found. When
the shutters are opened, violent gusts of wind
and rain come from the lamp, dousing the hold-
er (who gets no saving throw) and all others
within 30'. This "hurricane" lasts for 3 rounds;
each victim must make a saving throw vs. spells,
and all those failing are knocked over from the
winds. If this occurs, every item carried (exclud-
ing body clothing and/or armor but including
caps, gloves, treasure, etc.) is blown about, land-
ing scattered within 60'. A successful saving
throw indicates that the victim has fallen to the
ground in time, tightly grasping all items car-
ried. The hurricane lamp may thereafter be used
as a lamp of long burning for the remainder of
the day. It resets its "hurricane" effect every 24
hours, which must again be triggered before the
lamp can be of more beneficial use.
Lamp of Long Burning: This item is identical to
a normal adventurer's lantern. It is made of
metal, with a lower compartment for oil, a han-
dle, and shutters around the body to protect the
flame from wind. When filled with oil and lit as a
normal lantern, it will burn and shed light with-
out using oil. If the flame is ever doused by water,
the lamp of long burning becomes nonmagical.
Medallion of ESP, 30' Range: This magical me-
dallion is strung on a chain and worn around the
neck. If the wearer concentrates for 1 round, he
may read the thoughts of any one creature within
30'. The wearer may move normally but cannot
fight or cast spells while concentrating. The DM
must roll 1d6 each time this item is used; it will
not work properly on a roll of 1. If a 1 occurs, the
medallion will broadcast the thoughts of the user
to everyone within 30'! The DM may allow a sav-
ing throw vs. spells to prevent the medallion from
reading a creature's thoughts.
Medallion of ESP, 90' Range: This item is
identical to the medallion of ESP, 30' range, ex-
cept that it has a greater range.
Mirror of Life Trapping: This unique item
stores man-size or smaller creatures for an indefi-
nite period. Any such creature who looks into
the mirror must make a saving throw vs. spells or
be sucked into it (complete with all equipment
and treasure!). The mirror can store up to 20
creatures; when it is full, no more can be
trapped. Creatures trapped in the mirror do not
age or need food or air, but they are completely
powerless. Anyone can talk with the creatures
trapped in the mirror (if they speak the same
language). If the mirror is broken, all the crea-
tures trapped within are immediately released.
However, trapped individuals can be recovered
without harming the mirror by using a wish.
Muzzle of Training: This item is a device of
leather straps with metal buckles and may be fas-
tened over the mouth of any animal or monster
that has a bite attack. It will magically expand or
contract to fit the creature, and the victim can
breathe but cannot bite (or talk) while wearing
the muzzle. The muzzle will lock in place with a
command word (treat as a wizard lock by a 15th
level caster) and will unlock and fall off with a
second command. The muzzle can be com-
manded as often as desired.
Nail, Finger: This item appears identical to
the common iron nail of medieval carpentry, 1"-
4" long and very crudely made. It may easily be
overlooked if found with other construction ma-
terials unless a detect magic spell is used.
If mistaken for a nail of pointing and com-
manded to function, the nail disappears. When
the user next tries to avoid the attention of an
enemy (by hiding, invisibility, etc.), the nail re-
appears as a large glowing finger, pointing at the
character for 1d6 rounds. The finger nail may re-
appear during each similar attempt thereafter
(25% chance for each), but a remove curse will
cause it to vanish forever.
Nail of Pointing: This item appears identical
to a common carpentry nail. If its command
word is known, the user may cause it to point at
any nonmagical item named (door, stairway,
gold piece, etc.); the nail then turns into a finger
of bone and points toward the closest item of
that type. It will continue to point at that item
for 1 turn and then return to nail form. There is
no limit to the range of the nail's detection, but
it cannot detect living or undead creatures of any
type, nor can it detect any magical item or spell
effect. The nail of pointing will function once
per day.
Ointment: This white creamy salve is found in
a small wooden box with a cotton swab. If all the
salve found is rubbed on any part of the skin of
the recipient, a magical effect is produced. All
ointments look, smell, and taste the same. To
determine the type found, roll 1d6 and consult
the following. The DM may add other ointments
as desired.
1 Blessing: This salve gives the recipient a - 2
bonus to armor class and a + 2 bonus to all
saving throws for 1 turn.
2 Healing: This salve cures 2d6 + 2 points of
damage.
3 Poison: This salve seems to be an ointment
of blessing, but it is a poison and the recipi-
ent must make a saving throw vs. poison,
with a — 2 penalty to the roll, or die.
4 Scarring: This salve seems to be an ointment
of healing, but instead it inflicts 2d6 points
of severe burn damage, which can only be
repaired by ointment of soothing, a cureall
spell, or a wish.
5 Soothing: This salve cures the recipient of all
burn damage, whatever the amount and
whether magical or normal.
6 Tanning: This salve causes all the recipient's
skin to turn a bright color (determined ran-
domly from red, yellow, orange, blue,
green, or brown). The effect cannot be re-
moved but will gradually wear off in 1d4
months.
Pouch of Security: This item is the size of a
large sack (capacity 600 cn). Any attempt at
stealing the pouch causes it to scream, "I am
being stolen!" (in the Common tongue) re-
peatedly for one hour. Its cries can be heard to
120'. If its owner holds it and commands it to
be quiet, it will obey, but it will repeat its cries
if stolen again.
Quill of Copying: A quill is a large feather
that can be dipped in ink and used as a writing
implement. Usable only by spellcasters, this
quill can be commanded to copy any spell on a
scroll. It will copy only one spell per week at
most. The original scroll must be burned, and
the ashes mixed with rare ink (of 1,000 gp cost).
The quill is then placed on a blank scroll along
with an inkwell containing the prepared ink.
Upon command, the quill starts to write, creat-
ing two identical spells on the scroll instead of
the single original. If the scroll burnt contains
two or more spells, only one spell will be
copied—either the lowest level spell or (if more
than one are the lowest level) a randomly select-
ed spell. The quill will not copy protection
scrolls or any other writing except spell scrolls.
Unfortunately, there is a 25% chance per use
that the quill will suddenly drain of ink, spoiling
the entire scroll upon which it is writing. The
blot thus created cannot be removed from the
parchment by any means but a wish.
Rope of Climbing: This 50'-long, thin, strong
rope will climb in any direction upon the com-
mand of the owner. It can fasten itself to any
protruding surface and will support up to 10,000
cn of weight.
Scarab of Protection: This item automatically
absorbs any curse (whether by spell, scroll, or
other effect). It will also absorb a finger of death
(a cleric's raise dead spell, reversed). The scarab
will work 2d6 times before becoming worthless.
Slate of Identification: This valuable device,
usable only by spellcasters, can identify magical
items of most sorts. It is a piece of slate (stone)
held firmly in an ornate wooden frame, usually
about 3' square (though slates of many sizes are
possible, both larger and smaller). The user
holds the slate horizontally and places a magical
item upon it. When the item is lifted off, the
name of the item appears on the slate. If an item
has command words, one will appear on the slate
with each identification. The slate will only re-
peat itself when all the command words have
been revealed.
The slate is easily fooled by cursed items,
however. And it cannot detect an item's num-
ber of charges or special ability. A potion of
poison will be mistakenly identified as some
other type. Any cursed item will be identified
as a normal item. (These guidelines should be
strictly followed, lest the mystery of such items
found be ruined.)
The slate may expend up to ten charges per
day; items identified require the following num-
bers of charges per use.
Temporary Magical Items
Potion
Missile
Wand
Staff
Permanent Magical Items
Any permanent magical weapon
Armor or shield
Ring or rod
Minor miscellaneous item*
Major miscellaneous item*
Special
* The DM's judgment is required as to the value
and frequency of such items in the campaign.
A "major" item might be identifiable, but
only by making the slate useless for 1d4 days.
Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals: This
item may be used only once per day. The stone is
only 6" across, and it requires 1 turn to use. The
stone will summon an earth elemental and will
allow the user to control it, subject to normal
rules for elemental control.
Talisman of Elemental Travel: There are five
types of talismans. Roll 1d10 to determine the
exact item found.
Lesser Talisman of Air
1-2
Lesser Talisman of Earth
3-4
Lesser Talisman of Fire
5-6
Lesser Talisman of Water
7-8
Greater Talisman (all elements)
9-10
Lesser Talisman: This item is a round amulet
that may be found on a chain; there are corres-
ponding types to each of the four elements. It is
engraved with a triangle in the center and a sym-
bol above it (one of the ten symbols of the ele-
mental ranks). On the Prime Plane, the user may
press the central symbol while casting a conjure
elemental spell; the talisman will reverse the ef-
fect, sending the wearer into the appropriate ele-
mental plane. While wearing the talisman, the
user can breathe elemental matter as if it were
pure, clean air, and he gains in vision (normally
120'-1,200' range, depending on conditions).
Greater Talisman: This item is similar to a
lesser talisman in powers, but applies to all the
elemental planes. It is engraved with the four tri-
angular symbols of the planes, meeting in the
center. The ten symbols of all the elemental
ranks are inscribed around the edge. If the
proper command words are known, the wearer
may also force an elemental being to obey in-
structions. This uses one charge; the talisman
can expend up to ten charges per trip into an ele-
mental plane.
Wheel of Floating: This item appears identi-
cal to a normal wagon wheel, but it enables any
wagon upon which it is mounted to float on wa-
ter. One wheel of floating allows a wagon to be
towed across a river or stream, carrying up to
10,000 cn weight without sinking. Each addi-
tional wheel of floating allows 5,000 cn more
weight to be carried, to the normal maximum
for the wagon of 25,000 cn. Swamp travel is also
possible, but at a very slow movement rate unless
some water-type draft animal is available.
A cursed wheel of floating will, when reaching
the center of any river or stream, become stuck at
that point and cannot be moved until a remove
curse is applied by a 15th or higher level caster.
This allows progress to continue, but the curse
will return again at next use until the wheel is
destroyed.
Wheel of Fortune: This strange device is 10' in
diameter, mounted on a stand or wall fixture,
and easily rotated. It is decorated with a black-
and-white pattern of wedges, all intersecting at
the center where a green arrow is mounted; the
arrow does not turn with the wheel. Near the
rim, each black wedge is adorned by a white
skull and each white wedge by a red heart. If the
wheel is spun (easily done by any creature of 3
Strength or greater), it rotates for 3 rounds and
then comes to rest, with the green arrow point-
ing at one of the wedges (either black or white
with equal chances for each). However, a
charmed creature cannot move the wheel, and
each user can spin the wheel only once per day.
If the wheel has spun freely for the 3 rounds,
not touched or interfered with in any way, a
magical effect occurs, determined by the result
of the spin. The wheel cannot be affected by
magic of any kind, including telekinesis, and it
cannot be damaged in any way. A wish used to
affect the wheel will cause the wheel to vanish,
regardless of the wish. The wheel cannot be
moved except by a creature of 26 or more levels
(or Hit Dice). The wheel weighs 20,000 cn. For
each white or black wedge that appears, roll 1d6
and consult the following.
White Wedge
1 1,000 gold pieces appear
2 10 garnets appear
3 1 brooch appears
4 1 miscellaneous magical item appears
5 1 ability score rises by 1 point (maximum
score 18)
6 Prime Requisite or Constitution rises by 1
point (maximum score 18)
Black Wedge
1 1 ability score drops by 1 point (minimum
score 3)
2 Prime Requisite drops by 1 point
3 Constitution drops by 1 point
4 Least valuable magical item carried disinte-
grates
5 All nonmagical items, except for normal
clothing, disintegrate
6 Die (no saving throw)
The DM may select or randomly determine
the results of the spin. If desired, the wedges
may be numbered from 1-20, 1-100, or some
other conveniently determined number, and a
chart may be made with more varied results.
Wheel, Square: This odd "wheel," the size of
a normal wagon wheel, is useless on roads and
other flat terrain because it is perfectly square.
However, when mounted properly on a wagon,
it magically allows movement through mountain
and desert terrain where there is no road. A wag-
on with one square wheel can be pulled by two
horses and can move at 20'/turn; with two
wheels, 30'/turn; with three, 40'/turn; and with
four, the normal rate of 60'/turn is possible.
Armor and Shields
To use the Magical Item Subtable: 6. Armor
and Shields on page 230, roll 1d100 to deter-
mine the size of armor and check the appropriate
column. Then roll 1d100 to determine type of
armor (leather, banded, plate, etc.). If a result
indicates a type of armor not used in a DM's
campaign (for instance, some DMs don't allow
suit armor), reroll for a new result. Using the ap-
propriate column for the type of armor (or
shield) identified on the Armor Class Modifier
subtable, check for the AC modifier and sub-
tract the bonus from the base AC rating for that
type of armor. Also check for the chance of spe-
cial powers on the same subtable. If the percent-
age listed or less is rolled for the special power,
consult the Special Powers subtable. (Special
powers are described below.)
The base armor classes and the final AC rat-
ings when modified by a magical bonus are out-
lined below. Keep in mind that a shield, is used,
has its AC added to that of the character's armor.
Base Armor
Armor Class Modifier
+ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
AC Type
7 Leather
3 2
Scale mail
1 0
Chain mail
0 -1
Banded mail
0 -1 -2
Plate mail
Suit armor
-1 -2 -3 -4 -5
-3 -4 -5 -6
-1
Shield
For example, a fighter who came across chain
mail +3 and exchanged her normal scale mail
(AC 6) for the new armor would now be AC 2. If
she also happened upon a magical shield +2
and chose to use it, her armor class would be-
come -1 (AC 2 + -3 = -1).
The actual types of armor were described in
Chapter 4. Magical versions are identical in class
restrictions, and these restrictions must still be
observed by characters.
Note that armor and shields made for hu-
mans, dwarves, and elves are considered
"normal-sized," while halfling equipment is
counted as much smaller and giant equipment
much larger. For instance, a halfling shield offers
no protection to a normal-sized character, but a
normal-sized shield may be used by anyone—
including a halfling. And a giant-sized shield is
considered double normal size for a + 2 bonus to
armor class.
Cursed Armor and Shields
Armor and shields may be cursed. The DM
should roll 1d8 when either is placed as treasure;
a result of 1 indicates that the item is cursed.
Cursed armor, when first worn, appears to be ar-
mor of the type originally rolled on the armor
and shields subtable. When the character first
goes into combat with monsters, however, the
armor makes the character easier to hit by a pen-
alty equal to the bonus rolled. Once it has re-
vealed its true nature, the armor will not come
off its wearer; someone will have to cast a remove
curse to cancel the curse long enough for the
character to remove the armor. Or a 36th level
cleric can cast a remove curse to remove the curse
permanently, and the wearer may then enjoy his
magical armor with the proper benefits.
Special Power Descriptions
Armor and shields can have special powers
that can be used once per day at most, unless
noted otherwise. When both the armor and
shield worn have special powers, only one effect
can be produced per round at the user's choice
unless noted otherwise in the description. Note
that armor and shields that have special powers
are usable by any class that can use armor and
shields; there are no other restrictions.
The powers listed in the Special Powers sub-
table (in the Magical Item Subtable: 6. Armor
and Shields, page 229) are described in the fol-
lowing text.
Absorption: If the user is hit by a blow that
would cause an energy drain, the armor or shield
absorbs the draining effect and only the normal
damage affects the user. Each energy drain
causes the loss of one AC bonus modifier from
the armor or shield. When reduced to zero bo-
nuses, the item crumbles to dust. (For instance,
a shield +3 that has absorbed two energy drain
attacks is now only a shield + 1. If it absorbs yet
another energy drain, it is reduced to zero and
disintegrates.) This special power is not under
the control of the user; a character cannot choose
to suffer the energy drain and leave the item in-
tact. The normal limit of one use per day does
not apply to this power.
Charm: When the user is hit by an opponent,
the opponent must make a saving throw vs.
spells or become charmed by the user of the spe-
cial armor or shield (as the magic-user spell
charm person or charm monster). If a hand-held
weapon is used in the attack, the opponent gains
a +4 bonus to the saving throw. Only one victim
can be charmed each day, but any number of
saving throws may be made before the charm is
successful.
Cure Wounds: The armor or shield can cure
half of the damage the user has incurred, what-
ever that amount may be, once per day. It can
only cure the user, not another creature, and it
cannot affect poison, disease, or any other dam-
age but wounds.
Electricity: The armor or shield can, on com-
mand of the user, become charged with magical
electrical force. If the user is hit while "charged,"
the attacker takes 6d6 points of electrical dam-
age. The attacker may make a saving throw vs.
spells to take half damage; if a weapon is used in
the attack, a +4 bonus to the saving throw ap-
plies. The armor or shield can be charged or neu-
tralized as often as desired by using command
words, but it can only cause damage ("dis-
charge") once per day.
Energy Drain: The armor or shield can be-
come "charged" on command (as described un-
der the electricity special power), but instead of
inflicting damage, it causes the loss of one of the
opponent's levels or Hit Dice (as if a wight). The
same saving throw as the electricity power ap-
plies (possibly with bonuses); if successful, the
energy drain does not occur. The item can drain
one level or Hit Die per day, but any number of
saving throws may be made before this occurs.
Ethereality: The user may become ethereal on
command and may remain ethereal for as long as
desired. The user may return to the Prime Plane
when a second command word is spoken. Each
command word may be used once per day.
Fly: When commanded, the armor or shield
creates a fly spell effect on the user, which lasts
for 12 turns. The user may then travel in the air
at up to 360' per turn by mere concentration (as
per the 3rd level magical spell).
Gaseous Form: This valuable armor or shield
enables the user to turn into a cloud of gas (as
the potion of gaseous form), including all equip-
ment carried (unlike the potion). The user can
remain gaseous for up to 6 turns and can return
to normal form by mere concentration.
Haste: When commanded, the armor or
shield creates a haste spell effect on the user, al-
lowing double normal movement and number
of attacks (as the 3rd level magic-user spell). The
haste lasts for only 1 turn and is usable only once
per day.
Invisibility: When commanded, the armor or
shield makes the user invisible, as if the 2nd
level magic-user spell were cast. In addition, the
armor or shield can itself become invisible three
times per day, on command of the user.
Reflection: If a light or continual light spell is
cast at the user, the armor or shield will automat-
ically reflect it back at the caster, who must make
a saving throw vs. spells or be blinded (as given
in the respective spell descriptions). The item
will reflect up to three spells per day. In addi-
tion, when the user is in melee against a creature
with a gaze attack, the chances of gaze reflection
are the same as if a mirror were held but without
the — 2 penalty to the user's attack rolls (which
represents the awkwardness of holding the mir-
ror and attempting to attack at the same time).
Remove Curse: This armor or shield cannot it-
self be cursed when found. When commanded,
the item will create a remove curse spell effect on
the user only as if a 36th level caster (automati-
cally removing one curse). Note: This item will
function a total of three times, at a maximum
rate of once per day. After its three charges are
used, no other special abilities remain and it can-
not be recharged; the item does remain magical,
however, regardless of spent charges.
Missile Weapons and
Missiles
A missile weapon is a weapon (bow, sling,
etc.) that launches ammunition through the air,
and a missile is the ammunition (arrow, stone,
etc.) a missile weapon launches. Normal weapon
restrictions apply to magical items as well; for in-
stance, a magic-user cannot use a sling, and he
cannot use a magical sling either.
All magical missile weapons have bonuses that
give them additional pluses to both attack and
damage rolls. Magical missiles (such as an arrow
+ 2) also have bonuses to both attack and dam-
age rolls.
As noted in the text on "Magical Weapon
Subtables," page 228, there are two methods of
randomly generating weapons. The first, recom-
mended for character levels 1-10, is a single ta-
ble. If the DM has decided to place a magical
missile weapon or missile in a treasure hoard, he
or she can simply roll 1d100 on the Magical
Weapon Generation Table (page 230), find the
result in the appropriate column, and place the
item in the treasure.
When stocking treasure troves with magical
missile weapons and missiles for characters who
are above level 10, the DM can use the same
table—or he or she can use the more specific but
more complex method of random treasure gen-
eration, the Random Missile Weapon and Missile
Generation Checklist.
Note that if both a missile and the missile weap-
on firing it have bonuses, the total of their bonuses
and effects will apply in all cases. For example, a
crossbow +2 shooting a quarrel +3 would have a
+ 5 chance of attack and would do + 5 of damage
if the attack roll is successful. Likewise, normal ar-
rows shot by a long bow +1 can harm gargoyles
(which are damaged only by magic).
A magical missile normally becomes non-
magical after one use, regardless of whether the
attempt hits a target (its bonus to the attack roll
disappears). However, if the missile has a talent,
a missed shot will nor destroy the magic unless
noted otherwise in the following missile talent
descriptions. Usually, if the missile is retrieved
after a missed shot, it may be reused with its
magical bonuses intact.
Missile Talent Descriptions
The talents listed in the Missile Talents sub-
table (in the Magical Item Subtable: 7. Missile
Weapons and Missiles, page 230) are described
in the following text.
Biting: When the missile hits, the talent turns
it into a poisonous" snake. In addition to normal
damage, the victim must make a saving throw
vs. poison or die (or, at the DM's choice, take ex-
tra damage; 2d6, 2d10, or 2d20 are recom-
mended amounts).
Random Missile Weapon and Missile Genera-
tion Checklist
1. Roll 1d100 on the Magical Item Sub-
table: 7. Missile Weapons and Missiles
(page 230) to determine the item. Note
the weapon class. Missile weapons (such
as bows and blowguns) are Class D,
while missiles are Class A. (Weapon class
is a measure of how difficult it is to con-
struct weapons or ammunition; weapon
classes are discussed in full under
"Swords," below.)
2. The Magical Item Subtable: 7. Missile
Weapons and Missiles is further divided
into two subtables: Missile Weapons and
Missiles. Once the specific type of magical
item has been determined (long bow or
quarrels, for example), the DM should
check the appropriate subtable and note
the following:
• For missile weapons, the DM rolls
1d100 to find the magical bonus (to
attack and damage rolls). He or she
then rolls 1d4 and adds the die roll to
the magical bonus—this result will in-
dicate the range multiplier. (This is an
additional bonus a missile weapon
may have to extend its ranges; if a bo-
nus is indicated, multiply the weap-
on's short, medium, and long ranges
by the range multiplier—the results
will be the magical weapon's true
ranges.) Finally, the DM should roll
against the percentage listed for the
chance of an additional weapon modi-
fier. (The chance listed to be checked
is the one that corresponds with the
magical bonus first rolled on this sub-
table.) If the roll is successful, he or
she then goes to the Additional Weap-
on Modifiers Table on page 231 and
applies the results. (Additional modi-
fiers include bonuses against a specific
opponent and weapon talents.)
• For missiles, the DM rolls 1d100 to find
the magical bonus (to attack and dam-
age rolls). He or she then rolls the die
indicated for the number of missiles
found. Lastly, the DM rolls against the
percentage listed for the chance of a
missile talent. If the roll is successful,
the DM then rolls 1d100 on the Missile
Talents subtable (part of the Magical
Item Subtable: 7. Missile Weapons and
Missiles) to find the missile's specific
talent. (Talents are described below.)
Blinking: The missile with this talent will not
hit any friend of the user, "blinking" in and out
of existence until it reaches an enemy. (If the
sight of the enemy is blocked by friends, a penal-
ty may apply to the attack roll).
Charming: The victim hit must make a saving
throw vs. spells or be charmed by the user (as the
charm person or charm monster magic-user
spell).
Climbing: This talent only functions if the
missile is shot at an object. The missile securely
fastens itself to any object hit and then creates a
magical 50' rope, issuing from the spot hit. The
rope will support any weight of climbers and will
disappear 1 turn later or upon command of the
user. The missile cannot be moved after it hits,
and it disappears when the rope does.
Curing: A missile with this talent is obviously
blunt, inscribed with a holy symbol. When it
hits a living creature, it does not inflict damage.
Instead, it cures 2d6 points of damage plus 2 ex-
tra points for each magical bonus of the missile.
For example, if a 5 is rolled for a curing arrow
+ 2, the total points of damage cured are 7.
Disarming: This talent will only function if
the victim hit is holding a weapon or other item.
The victim must make a saving throw vs. spells
or drop the item. A dropped item may normally
be recovered in 1 round (unless it falls into a pit
or chasm, if someone else grabs it, etc.).
Dispelling: When a missile with this talent
hits, it creates a dispel magic effect centered on
the point of impact (a 20' cube) as if cast by a
15th level caster.
Flying: A missile with this talent can be shot
at ranges five times greater than normal. If the
missile weapon firing this missile is also magical
and has an additional range multiplier, the ef-
fect is cumulative; multiply each maximum
range by five. If the missile weapon is not magi-
cal, use the following maximum ranges.
Arrow, short bow
250/500/750
Arrow, long bow
350/700/1,050
Quarrel, light crossbow
300/600/900
Quarrel, heavy crossbow
400/800/1,200
Sling stone
200/400/800
Lighting: The missile talent can create a light
spell effect (30' diameter), either upon com-
mand or when it hits a target. If a creature is hit,
the victim must make a saving throw vs. spells or
be blinded by the light (as if the spell had been
cast at its eyes). The missile disintegrates when
the light is created.
Penetrating: A missile with this talent cannot
be slowed by underbrush, webs (normal or mag-
ical), or other forms of cover. The victim's armor
class is not modified by cover of any sort.
Refilling: This talent gives no special effects to
a missile when shot. If left in a container with
other missiles of the same type (that is, a refilling
arrow with normal arrows or a refilling sling
stone with normal sling stones), however, it will
magically create 1d20 more missiles of the nor-
mal type each day.
Screaming: This talent's effect occurs when
the missile is shot, even if it misses the target. As
it travels through the air, the missile produces a
loud cry, causing all within 30' of its path to
check morale. If the morale check is failed, the
victims will retreat in fear for 1d8 rounds.
Seeking: This talent will only function when
the missile is shot at an object; it is not usable
against creatures. It will automatically hit any
one target object within range as long as a path
of travel is clear. It may be used as a missile of
disarming, if desired, or it can be used to sever a
normal rope, pierce a sack, push a button, trig-
ger a trap, etc. It will automatically miss any
creature at which it is aimed.
Sinking: When shot at a water craft of any
sort, a missile with this talent inflicts 1d10 + 10
(11-20) hull points of damage when it hits. (The
armor class of the vessel is used, as if the shot
were a ramming or catapult attack.)
Slaying: If the die rolls for a missile indicate
this talent, go to the Opponents subtable in the
Additional Weapon Modifiers Table (page 231)
and roll 1d100. The result indicates the missile
talent's opponent. When that opponent is hit by
this missile, the victim must make a saving throw
vs. death ray or die.
Speaking: A missile with this talent will miss
any creature at which it is shot. It is used for com-
munication purposes only. The user may give the
missile any message of 20 words or less and then
shoot it, either naming a place within ten miles or
aiming at a target. The missile will automatically
land on the floor or ground in the target area and
will repeat the message aloud twice.
Stunning: The victim hit by a missile with this
talent must make a saving throw vs. spells or be
stunned for 1d6 rounds.
Teleporting: A victim hit by a missile with this
talent must make a saving throw vs. spells (at a
+ 2 bonus to the roll) or be teleported to a point
1d100 miles away, with the direction and dis-
tance determined randomly. Unlike the effect of
the magic-user spell, the victim cannot arrive in
the air or within a solid object.
Transporting: A victim hit by a missile with
this talent must make a saving throw vs. spells or
be sent to a point up to 360' away, as determined
by the user of the missile. The effect is identical
to the magic-user spell dimension door, and it
cannot cause the victim to appear within a solid
object.
Wounding: When a missile with the wound-
ing talent strikes a target creature, it inflicts nor-
mal damage. In addition, however, it causes the
loss of 1 hit point per round thereafter until
magical curing is applied (a potion, cure spell of
any type, etc.). However, no undead creature or
construct (golem, living statue, etc.) can be
wounded with this talent, and such creatures
suffer only the initial damage.
Swords
Normal weapon restrictions for character class-
es also apply to magical swords. For example, a
cleric cannot use a sword, so a cleric cannot use a
magical sword either.
A magical sword's bonus is added to both its
Random Sword Generation Checklist
1. Roll 1d100 on the Magical Item Subtable: 8. Swords (page 231) to determine the type of sword.
Note the weapon class. Short and normal swords are Class C, while bastard and two-handed
swords are Class D. (Weapon class is discussed in full below.)
2. Roll 1d100 again and check the appropriate weapon class column for the magical attack and
damage bonus. Roll 1d100 against the percentage listed for the chance of an additional modi-
fier; if the roll is successful, see the Additional Weapon Modifiers Table on page 231 and
apply the results. (Additional modifiers include bonuses against a specific opponent and
weapon talents.)
3. Since all magical swords have a chance of intelligence, check the Intelligence of Sword subtable
(in the Magical Item Subtable: 8. Swords) by again rolling 1d100. The result will indicate the
sword's intelligence (if any), method of communication (if any), languages known (if any), and
number of powers (if any). (These abilities are explained below.)
4. If the sword is intelligent, determine alignment and ego as indicated in the text below under
"Sword Alignment, Ego, and Control Checks." Also do a control check to see if the intelligent
sword will control its user.
5. The powers available to a sword include primary powers, extraordinary powers, and the ability
to read magic on command. If a primary or extraordinary power is indicated for a sword, go to
the Primary and Extraordinary Powers subtable (in the Magical Item Subtable: 8. Swords) and
roll 1d100 in the appropriate column. If more than one power was indicated, roll as necessary,
ignoring any duplicate rolls except those that are allowed.
attack rolls and damage rolls. Some swords also
have an additional bonus that is used only when
fighting a special type of opponent. Other
swords may have bonuses or modifiers such as
the ability to cast certain spell effects. The DM
may wish to refer to such spells to find the exact
effect. Note that each effect can only be used
once per day and that no meditating is needed to
gain the spellcasting ability.
As noted in the text on "Magical Weapon
Subtables," page 228, there are two methods of
randomly generating swords. The first, recom-
mended for character levels 1-10, is a single ta-
ble. If the DM has decided to place a magical
sword in a treasure hoard, he or she can simply
roll 1d100 on the Magical Weapon Generation
Table (page 230), find the result in the appropri-
ate column, and place the item in the treasure.
When stocking treasure troves with magical
swords for characters who are above level 10, the
DM can use the same table—or he or she can use
the more specific but more complex method of
random sword generation, the Random Sword
Generation Checklist.
Weapon Class
Magical weapons typically must be made by a
special procedure, usually performed by a
magic-user or cleric working in conjunction with
a blacksmith or armorer. Weapon class is a mea-
sure of the difficulty of that item's construction.
The weapon tables give the weapon class for each
weapon. Generally, Class A weapons are small
and temporary magical items, the most fre-
quently found; Class D weapons are the largest
and rarest as they require the most work.
At the DM's option, other new weapons may
be invented. Each new weapon should be cate-
gorized as to one of the four weapon classes,
which are as follows:
• Class A weapons are temporary items; they
normally become nonmagical once used,
even if the attack roll indicated a miss. Mag-
ical missiles fall into this category.
• Class B weapons include all thrown weapons
(javelin, spear, etc.) and small melee weap-
ons.
• Class C weapons are larger hand-held items,
including short swords and normal swords.
• Class D weapons are two-handed items (in-
cluding bastard swords) and all missile
weapons.
Designing Special Swords
Naturally, the DM may not want to leave the
nature of special swords in a campaign entirely to
chance. It's entirely appropriate to create special
swords that accomplish certain feats in a cam-
paign. If one campaign goal in a campaign is the
destruction of a certain dragon, for instance, the
DM may wish to introduce a dragon-slaying
sword into a treasure trove acquired by the player
characters.
To create a magical sword from the ground up,
follow the procedure described above for rolling
up swords, but choose, don't roll, the sword's at-
tributes. Keep in mind, however, that the weapon
will remain long after the campaign has ended, so
avoid creating swords that are too powerful and
that may be a problem in future campaigns.
Cursed Swords
Any sword may be cursed. When the die rolls
indicate a sword as treasure, roll 1d20. If the re-
sult is a 1 or 2, place a cursed sword in the trea-
sure instead.
A cursed sword will seem to be a normal magi-
cal sword (whatever type was first rolled) until
used in combat. At that time, the curse is re-
vealed. When using that weapon, the sword will
cause the player to subtract the amount that was
to have been a bonus from all attack and damage
rolls. (For example, if a character believes he is
carrying a sword + 3 when in fact he is carrying a
cursed sword, he will subtract 3 from both his
attack and damage rolls.)
Once a character uses the cursed sword in battle,
he may not throw it away: He is under a compul-
sion to keep it and use it. If it is stolen or sold, the
character is cursed with the desire to get it back.
The character will always use that weapon when in
battle. (The DM may have to tell the player that
this is what the character wants—and no
arguments!—until the character is rid of the curse.)
Only a spellcaster with a dispel evil or remove
curse spell can help a character be rid of the weap-
on. If the spellcaster is less than 26th level, the
spell simply cures the character of his compulsion;
he may now get rid of the cursed sword. If the
spellcaster is 26th level or above, however, the dis-
pel evil or remove curse spell will permanently
change the cursed sword into a normal magical
sword of whatever type was originally rolled.
Sword Abilities
Although magical swords can be easily and
quickly generated from the Magical Weapon
Generation Table on page 230, the text in this
section can help add color to a specific sword.
This section can also define more specific swords
for the DM who uses the Random Sword Gener-
ation Checklist. Magical swords, as noted in the
optional checklist, can be generated with a num-
ber of additional abilities, including:
• Magical bonuses to attack and damage rolls;
• Additional modifiers such as attack and
damage bonuses against specific opponents
or special talents (as obtained from the Ad-
ditional Weapon Modifiers Table on page
231);
• Sword intelligence, which allows communi-
cation via empathy or speech and languages
known (if the sword is intelligent and can
speak);
• If intelligent, alignment and ego and a
need to control its user (as determined by a
control check); and
• Powers, including primary powers, extraor-
dinary powers, and the ability to read
magic.
These special sword abilities are outlined in
this section.
Magical Bonuses
All magical swords have a bonus from +1 to
+ 5 that is applied to all attack and damage rolls
made by that weapon.
Additional Modifiers
As noted on the Magical Item Subtable: 8.
Swords (page 231), there is a percentage chance
for a magical weapon to have an additional mod-
ifier; these modifiers are generated using the
Additional Weapon Modifiers Table. Note that
magical weapons can have only one additional
modifier—either an extra bonus against an op-
ponent or a talent.
The typical weapon modifier is an extra magi-
cal bonus against a specific opponent. This is an
additional + 1 to + 5 on attack and damage rolls
beyond the weapon's basic magical bonus
against the sword's designated opponent. For ex-
ample, a sword +1 that the die roll has indi-
cated has a + 3 against spellcasters would be a
sword +1, +4 vs. spellcasters.
A more unusual modifier is a special ability
called a talent, which may be a spell or some oth-
er effect posed by the sword. Swords are more
likely to have a talent than are other types of
weapons; there is only a 10% chance that a mis-
cellaneous weapon will have a talent, as noted on
the Magical Item Subtable: 9. Miscellaneous
Weapons (page 231).
Descriptions of additional bonuses and talents
can be found in the section on "Additional
Weapon Modifiers," below.
Sword Intelligence, Communication, and
Speech
If the 1d100 roll on the Intelligence of Sword
subtable in the Magical Item Subtable: 8.
Swords indicates that the sword has an Intelli-
gence of 7 or better, the sword is a very remark-
able one indeed. It is intelligent—it is sentient,
with a personality and its own goals and manner-
isms. Typically, it also has one or more primary
or extraordinary powers (described below).
The DM should role-play an intelligent sword
just as he or she would any nonplayer character.
Note that intelligent swords have no wisdom,
and thus they should be played accordingly, rely-
ing on the owner's wisdom for guidance and de-
cision making.
After finding the sword's Intelligence from
the Intelligence of Sword subtable, note how it
communicates with its owner, either through
empathy (a limited telepathy that works only
with the person holding the sword and is usable
only for communicating thoughts, not for read-
ing minds) or through speech.
Next, if the sword's Intelligence is 10 or higher,
determine how many languages the sword knows.
(Roll the die indicated under the languages
column of the Intelligence of Sword subtable.)
A sword that speaks automatically knows the
Common tongue and its alignment tongue. If it
knows more than one language, the DM must
determine which languages it speaks. Also note
that if a sword has the ability to read magic, it
can also speak the languages it can read. (The
read magic ability is discussed below with the
primary and extraordinary powers.)
The DM will likely want to come up with a
history for the sword—who made it, why it was
made, and how it has been used over the years—
and then use that history to determine what lan-
guages it speaks. For instance, an intelligent
sword that has a + 2 magical bonus and an addi-
tional + 3 bonus vs. dragons could have been
forged a hundred years ago by a famous dwarf
craftsman and then used by a human hero who
slew many dragons and drove others away. For
these reasons, the sword may speak Common,
dwarvish, and dragon, as these languages best
correspond to its history.
Sword Alignment, Ego, and Control Checks
Intelligent swords have alignments just as
characters do. To determine the alignment of an
intelligent sword, roll 1d20.

A character cannot detect a sword's alignment
until he picks it up and handles it. If the character handling the sword is of the same alignment,
there will be no bad reaction. However, if the
alignment is different, the user will take damage
each round while holding the sword. Gloves and
other protective insulation do not protect the
character from this damage, which is as follows.

In addition to alignment, intelligent swords
also have egos. Roll 1d12 to determine the ego
score of the sword. (Ego is a measure of the
strength of a sword's personality.) Then add the
sword's Intelligence and ego scores to find its will
power. Add 1 to the will power score for each ex-
traordinary power the sword has (if any). Make a
note of the total will power of the sword.
A character's will power is the total of the char-
acter's Intelligence and Wisdom scores. The DM
may subtract 1d8 points of will power if the char-
acter is wounded, and if the sword and the user
are of different alignments, the sword gains 1d10
points to its will power. (This additional bonus
must be determined for each change of users.)
When an intelligent sword is handled, it may
try to control its user. The DM must compare the
will power of the sword to that of the user by do-
ing a control check. An intelligent sword will try
to control its user in each of five different situa-
tions, including the following:
• When the user first handles the sword.
• When the user is wounded and has half or
less of his normal hit points remaining.
• When the user acquires any other magical
weapon.
• When anyone else uses the sword.
• When a special purpose could be used (if
applicable).
To make a control check, the DM simply com-
pares the will power scores of both user and
sword, with the higher score taking control. Such
control lasts until either the sword is satisfied or
the situation that caused the control check has
passed. The DM must determine the actions of
any sword in control; typical actions include the
following:
• Leading the user past magical weapons that
the user would have stopped for or causing
the user to discard other weapons.
• Forcing the user to charge into combat to
win glory for itself.
• Making the user surrender to an oppo-
nent—either one more worthy of the sword
or one easier for the sword to control.
• Forcing the user to spend money on items
for the sword, such as jeweled fittings, fancy
scabbards, and so forth.
Primary and Extraordinary Powers
The sword's Intelligence determines how
many primary and extraordinary powers it has,
as noted in the Primary and Extraordinary
Powers subtable of the Magical Item Subtable:
8. Swords, page 231. The DM should roll 1d100
once for each primary and extraordinary power
of the sword and find the results on the sub-
table. Duplicate results should be rerolled unless
indicated otherwise.
Primary Powers: The user must have the sword
in hand and be concentrating on the power in
order to use it. Any power may be used once per
round. A primary power is usable as often as de-
sired unless noted otherwise. These powers are
defined as follows:
• Detect evil (good). The sword is able to de-
tect one of these intentions up to a 20'
range. No sword can do both; the DM must
determine which version the sword can do.
• Detect gems. The sword can detect all types
of gems and the amount of each within a
60' range, pointing itself in that direction.
• Detect magic. The sword can cause all magic
within 20' to glow (as the spell effect) up to
three times per day.
• Detect metal. The sword can detect metal of
any type requested up to a range of 60'. It
will point in the direction of the material,
but it cannot detect the amount.
• Detect shifting walls and rooms. The sword
can find these items if within 10'.
• Detect slopes. The sword can locate all slop-
ing passages within a 10' range.
• Find secret doors. The sword can locate all
secret doors within a 10' range up to three
times per day.
• Find traps. The sword can detect traps of all
types within 10' up to three times per day.
• See invisible. The sword can find all invisi-
ble and hidden objects and creatures (but
not secret doors) within a 20' range.
Extraordinary Powers: An extraordinary power
is only generated if the sword has a 12 or higher
Intelligence or if a roll for a primary power gave a
result of 96-99. If the sword has an extraordinary
power, roll 1d100 and find the power on the Pri-
mary and Extraordinary Powers subtable of the
Magical Item Subtable: 8. Swords. Except for the
extra damage and healing powers, duplicate re-
sults should be rerolled. An extraordinary power
may only be used three times per day unless
noted otherwise. These powers are defined as
follows:
• Clairaudience. As with the potion, the user
may hear all noises in one area within 60'
through the ears of a creature in that area.
• Clairvoyance. As with the potion, the user
may see any area up to 60' away through the
eyes of a creature in that area.
• ESP. As with the potion, the user may listen
to the thoughts of any one living creature
within 60'.
• Extra damage. This power lasts for 1d10
rounds when commanded. The user may in-
flict four times the normal damage on each
successful hit. This power may be generated
more than once; each duplicate roll in-
creases the multiplier by 1 (to 5 times, 6
times, etc.).
• Flying. As with the potion, the user may fly in
the air for a maximum of three turns per use.
• Healing. The sword with this power can
heal up to a total of 6 points of damage per
day, at the rate of 1 hit point per round.
This power may be generated more than
once; duplicate rolls increase the amount of
healing by 6 points each (to 12, 18, etc. per
day), but the rate of healing remains the
same.
• Illusion. The user may create a phantasmal
force, as with the magic-user spell.
• Levitation. As with the potion, the user may
float in the air for a maximum of three turns
per use.
• Telekinesis. The user may move up to 2,000
cn of weight by mere concentration as with
the ring.
• Telepathy. This is the same as ESP (above),
but with the ability to "send" thoughts to
the creature contacted (as with a helm of te-
lepathy).
• Teleportation. The user may teleport once
per day as with the magic-user spell.
• X-ray vision. The user may see through
things as if wearing a ring of X-ray vision.
Miscellaneous Weapons
Normal weapon restrictions apply to magical
miscellaneous weapons as well. For example,
since a magic-user cannot use a polearm, a
magic-user cannot use a magical polearm, either.
Note: This section is nor used for determining
magical swords or magical missile weapons; see
the appropriate sections above instead.
As with magical swords, a weapon's magical
bonus is added to both attack and damage rolls.
And as with swords, any item may be cursed,
though there is less chance than with swords.
Roll 1d20; if the result is 1, the item is cursed.
The item is handled in the same manner as a
cursed sword.
Some miscellaneous weapons have an addi-
tional bonus that is used only when fighting a
specific type of opponent. Other weapons may
have a talent, the ability to cast certain spell ef-
fects. (The DM may wish to refer to such spells to
find the exact effect. Note that each effect can
only be used once per day and that no meditat-
ing is needed to gain the spellcasting ability.)
As noted in the text on "Magical Weapon
Subtables," page 228, there are two methods of
randomly generating weapons. The first, recom-
mended for character levels 1-10, is a single ta-
ble. If the DM has decided to place a magical
miscellaneous weapon in a treasure hoard, he or
she can simply roll 1d100 on the Magical Weap-
on Generation Table (page 230), find the result
in the appropriate column, and place the item in
the treasure.
When stocking treasure troves with magical
miscellaneous weapons for characters who are
above level 10, the DM can use the same table—
or he or she can use the more specific but more
complex method of random weapon generation,
the Random Miscellaneous Weapon Generation
Checklist.
Weapon classes are explained above under
"Swords."
Unlike swords, miscellaneous weapons are not
normally intelligent. If desired, the Intelligence
of Sword subtable (from the Magical Item Sub-
table: 8. Swords, page 231) may be used, but a
penalty of -6% should be applied to the roll.
Note that only swords can attain 10 or greater In-
telligence.
Random Miscellaneous Weapon Generation
Checklist
1. Roll 1d100 on the Magical Item Subtable:
9. Miscellaneous Weapons (page 231) and
find the type of weapon. Note the weap-
on class of the item.
2. Checking the appropriate weapon class
column, roll 1d100 on the Magical Bo-
nuses and Modifiers subtable (from the
Magical Item Subtable: 9- Miscellaneous
Weapons). The result will indicate the ba-
sic magical bonus to attack and damage
rolls.
3. For a weapon that has a +1 to + 4 magi-
cal bonus, roll 1d100 against the percent-
age listed in the subtable. If the roll is
successful, go to the Additional Weapon
Modifiers Table (page 231) and roll for
the additional bonus against a specific
opponent.
4. For a weapon that has a +5 magical bo-
nus, roll 1d100 against the percentage
listed in the subtable. If the roll is success-
ful, go to the Additional Weapon Modi-
fiers Table and roll on the Talents
subtable for a talent instead of a bonus
against an opponent.
Designing Special Weapons
Instead of randomly determining results, the
DM may wish to select these weapons with a
theme or purpose in mind. For example, if the
DM wants to place a special weapon for a cleric,
he or she could select a mace or hammer from
the Magical Item Subtable: 9. Miscellaneous
Weapons, select a bonus against undead (from
the Additional Weapon Modifiers Table), and
give it a talent for deflecting energy drains (from
the Talent subtable in the latter table). In this
way, the DM can provide the tools the characters
will need for completing special adventures in a
campaign.
Remember that the weapon will remain after
the crisis is solved. Though the weapon can be
later removed from the game (by using thieves,
special damage, or various magical means), the
DM should avoid placing items that are too pow-
erful and that may cause problems later.
Returning Weapons
This type of hand-hurled missile weapon will
return to the user if it misses the target; it is
sometimes called a "boomerang" weapon. If it
misses, it returns at the end of the same round
and may automatically be safely caught by the
character throwing it (unless the user has become
paralyzed, confused, immobile, etc.). If it hits
the target, the weapon does not return by itself.
Miscellaneous Weapon
Abilities
Any miscellaneous weapon can have addition-
al weapon modifiers, such as bonuses against op-
ponents or talents. These abilities are generated
using the Additional Weapon Modifiers Table.
Such modifiers are described in the following
section.
Additional Weapon
Modifiers
Two types of weapon modifiers are generated
on the Additional Weapon Modifiers Table on
page 231. Unless stated otherwise, the weapon
bonuses vs. opponents and the talents listed in
this section are applicable to all weapons, in-
cluding missile weapons, swords, and miscella-
neous weapons. Of course, class restrictions
apply to items with these modifiers, and a class
that cannot use a normal version of a weapon
cannot use a magical version that has an addi-
tional modifier.
Weapon Bonus vs. Opponent
This weapon modifier is an additional attack
and damage bonus when the weapon is used
against a specific opponent (for example, a
sword +1, +2 vs. enchanted monsters). The
amount of the bonus may be from +1 to + 5
greater than the normal magical bonus of the
weapon, as determined by the Additional Weap-
on Modifiers Table. (For instance, a sword +1
that has a + 3 bonus against lycanthropes would
be a. sword +1, +4 vs. lycanthropes.)
The DM should feel free to add more catego-
ries to the types of opponents as appropriate,
taking care not to upset the balance of the game.
The opponent categories listed on the Oppo-
nents subtable (from the Additional Weapon
Modifiers Table) are as follows:
• Bugs includes all normal and giant-sized
forms of arachnids (spider, tick, scorpion,
etc.), insects (ant, beetle, fly, etc.), and chi-
lopods (centipedes, etc.).
• Constructs includes all created monsters
such as living statues or golems. Gargoyles
are also included in this category.
• Dragonkind includes all dragons of all col-
ors and sizes plus draconian monsters such
as the chimera, hydra (all types), salaman-
der, and wyvern.
• Enchanted monsters includes those crea-
tures that cannot be hit by normal or silver
weapons.
• Giantkind includes all giants and all giant-
type creatures such as ogres, Cyclopes, and
other humanoids that are larger than man-
size (including characters who have con-
sumed a potion of growth.).
• Lycanthropes includes all types of were-
creatures, whether in animal form or not.
This includes all characters afflicted with ly-
canthropy.
• Planar monsters includes those creatures that
come from the elemental, ethereal, astral, or
outer planes. All types are included, but Im-
mortals do not count as planar monsters.
• Regenerating monsters includes all crea-
tures that regain more than 1 hit point per
day by rest or other means. This includes
any creature wearing a ring of regeneration.
• Reptiles and dinosaurs includes all normal
and giant-sized forms of lizards, snakes,
turtles, crocodiles, and dinosaurs.
• Spell-immune monsters includes those crea-
tures that are immune to 1 or more spell
levels, as specified in the monster descrip-
tions (such as drakes) in Chapter 14. This
does not include creatures that are immune
merely to certain specific spells (such as the un-
dead immunity to sleep, charm, and hold).
• Spellcasters includes all clerics, elves, magic-
users, and other creatures able to use spells
(such as paladins or spirits, for example).
• Undead includes all types of undead crea-
tures, both land and water, from skeleton to
lich.
• Water-breathing monsters includes those
creatures able to breathe water, including
characters under the influence of a potion or
ring of water breathing. Note that aquatic
mammals (whale, dolphin, etc.) breathe air
and are not included in this category.
• Weapon-using monsters includes those
creatures that have weapons in hand (not
claws) at the time of a melee. For example, a
wererat wielding a sword would be affected
by this additional bonus, but the wererat
would not be affected if it were attacking
only with its bite.
Talents
Talents are unusual magical powers that vari-
ous weapons can have (though they are most of-
ten applied to swords). They are not the same as
a sword's primary or extraordinary powers, which
are described later, and a sword can have both a
talent and primary and extraordinary powers.
Talents can be certain spell effects or some other
useful ability.
All talents may be used only once per day un-
less noted otherwise. Talents that duplicate spell
effects are not actual spells, and they require nei-
ther verbal casting nor concentration. The use of
a talent occurs in the magical spells and items
phase of a combat round. The talents listed on
the Talents subtable (from the Additional Weap-
on Modifiers Table, page 231) are as follows:
• Breathing. The weapon with this talent can
create either one water breathing spell effect
per day or one air breathing effect per day.
Air breathing supplies only the user with
pure air for 1 turn, and it can be used to
counter the effects of airlessness, poisoned
air (such as a gas trap), and so forth; how-
ever, it cannot negate the effects of any
breath weapon.
• Charming. The talent can create one charm
person spell effect per day to a 120' range
(as the 1st level magic-user spell).
• Deceiving. The weapon with this talent can
be commanded to change the appearance of
the user. The size cannot be changed, but
facial features, equipment carried, etc. can
all be modified. This is only an illusion; the
user remains intact. The weapon must be
held to create the disguise (unsheathed in
the case of edged weapons), and it cannot
disguise itself.
• Defending. The bonus of the weapon may
be used normally (applying to attack and
damage rolls) with this talent or as a bonus
to the armor class of the user. A missile
weapon cannot have this talent (roll again).
• Deflecting. If the user is hit by a blow that
would cause an energy drain, the talent can
automatically deflect the blow. After the op-
ponent hits, the user may decide whether to
deflect the blow. If used for deflecting, the
weapon absorbs the effect of the energy drain
but at the cost of one magical bonus, which is
drained from the weapon for each energy
drain negated. If an energy drain deflected
reduces the bonuses to below zero (such as a
sword +1 deflecting a specter's attack, which
causes a double energy drain), the weapon
disintegrates; the extra drain does not affect
the user. If a missile weapon has this talent, it
must be held in hand to deflect the blow
(and cannot be used at melee range).
• Draining. Upon command, the weapon with
this talent can drain one level or Hit Die
when it strikes an opponent (as if a wraith),
in addition to normal damage. The com-
mand may be spoken after the attack roll is
made. The weapon can drain 1d4+4 levels
or Hit Dice in all; it then loses this ability for-
ever. Energy drain cannot affect any creature
that has energy drain powers (wight, wraith,
specter, etc.). If a missile weapon has this tal-
ent, it may be applied to any missile shot,
but each level drained also drains one magi-
cal bonus from the weapon. If the weapon
becomes nonmagical because of this loss, it
loses the ability to energy drain as well.
• Extinguishing. The weapon with this talent is
cool to the touch. When used against a fire-
using creature (such as a red dragon or fire
elemental, for example) the magical bonus of
the weapon is doubled. In addition, the
weapon will douse a normal fire if thrust into
it. It has no effect on magical fire. If a missile
weapon has this talent, it applies to all mis-
siles fired instead of to the weapon itself.
• Finding. The talent can create one locate
object spell effect per day to a 120' range (as
the 2nd level magic-user spell).
• Flaming. The point or edge of this weapon
that has this talent will blaze with flames
upon command. The flames will not harm
the weapon or the user, but they will add a
+ 2 bonus to attack rolls against hippo-
griffs, pegasi, rocs, and trolls and a +3 bo-
nus against treants and undead monsters.
The bonus applies to both attack and dam-
age rolls. The flame may easily be used to
light a torch, lantern, or other flammable
item. If a missile weapon has this talent, it
applies to all missiles fired instead of the
weapon itself.
• Flying. The weapon with this talent can fly
in the air and attack by itself. In battle, it
must first be used normally at least once. If
then commanded to fly, it will continue to
attack the same opponent for three more
rounds, returning to its master after that
time (or when commanded to return). Its
attack rolls are made as if it were wielded
normally, based on the class and level of the
user. If a missile weapon has this talent, it
creates normal missiles as it shoots; the own-
er does not have to supply it with new mis-
siles, and he cannot supply it with magical
missiles to shoot.
• Healing. This talent can create one cure se-
rious wounds spell effect per day, curing the
user only of 2d6 + 2 points of damage (as
the 4th level cleric spell).
• Hiding. The weapon with this talent can
create one invisibility spell effect on only
the user when commanded to do so. In ad-
dition, the weapon can itself become invisi-
ble three times per day.
• Holding. This talent can create one hold
person spell effect per day to a 180' range
(as the 2nd level cleric spell).
• Lighting. The weapon that has this talent
can create one light spell effect per day to a
120' range and lasting for 6 turns (similar to
the 1st level magic-user spell).
• Silencing. This talent can create one silence,
15' radius spell effect per day to 180' range
(as the 2nd level cleric spell).
• Slicing. This talent applies only to edged
weapons (swords daggers, etc.). If any other
weapon type indicates this talent, roll
again. If the edged weapon's attack roll is 19
or 20 counting the weapon's magical bonus
but no other bonuses, the opponent struck
must make a saving throw vs. death ray or
be struck dead with one blow. If the saving
throw is successful, the victim still takes tri-
ple normal damage from the blow. These
special damage bonuses do not apply when
the weapon is used against constructs or un-
dead creatures of any sort.
• Slowing. When a successful hit is made, the
weapon with this talent can cause the oppo-
nent struck to become slowed (as the reverse
of the 3rd level magic-user spell haste) for 1
turn (no saving throw). The user may decide
whether or not to use this effect after the
swing hits.
• Speeding. The talent will, on command,
create a haste spell effect on the user only.
The user may then move at double normal
speed and attack twice per round for 1 turn
(similar to the 3rd level magic-user spell).
• Translating. The weapon that has this talent
will, on command, enable the user to un-
derstand any and all languages heard. The
ability lasts for 6 turns.
• Watching. The weapon with this talent may
be commanded to watch for any one mon-
ster type or race. The weapon can then sense
the presence of the creatures specified, and
it will vibrate slightly if one or more of the
named creatures come within 60' of it. The
vibration will silently alert the user. A spe-
cific creature cannot be named, only a race
or monster type, and the weapon can only
sense one race or type per day, even if none
are sensed.
• Wishing. This talent will grant 1d3 wishes
to the user (identical to the 9th level magic-
user spell).
Artifacts
An artifact is a powerful magical item created
by an Immortal (see Chapter 15) and imbued
with his personal power. Each artifact is unique
and should be individually designed by the DM.
Nothing regarding an artifact happens by
chance, for the destiny of each is planned and
controlled by the Immortals. Thus, they are only
rarely encountered, most often by high-level
characters on a path to Immortality. No mortal
retains an artifact for long.
Artifacts are treated as 40th level for purposes
of determining their magical effects. They are
immune to most attacks, except those by other
artifacts or weapons of at least + 5 bonus; how-
ever, each can be destroyed by a legendary meth-
od that is unique to that artifact. Wishes, the
most powerful mortal magic, have no effect on
artifacts.
Using an artifact inflicts handicaps and penal-
ties on the character. A handicap is a permanent
effect that cannot be negated as long as the char-
acter has the artifact. It usually appears when a
power of the artifact is first used. A penalty is a
temporary disadvantage that can be offset by
magic or time while the artifact is possessed.
Artifacts have four power levels: minor, lesser,
greater, and major. These levels affect the num-
ber and strength of the artifact's powers, handi-
caps, and penalties, as in the Artifacts Table.
Sample artifact
MASK OF BACHRAEUS
(Minor artifact: Entropy, evil)
History: This mask was made by Bachraeus,
an Immortal who became the patron of the me-
dusae. The mask was to be worn by the high cler-
ic of a secret cult that grew within the Milennian
Empire and formed a dangerous alliance with
the medusae. With the fall of that empire and
the destruction of the cult, the mask was lost.
Description: A smooth, blue mask of a strange
ceramic material; the features are stylized, possi-
bly female or elvish. A wig of long, dark, leath-
ery strips is attached at the top and back.
Powers: The Mask of Bachraeus possesses the
following powers:
• Flesh to stone, 120' range, one creature
(gaze attack).
• Charm person, 120' range, one creature
(gaze attack).
• Detect magic, 60' range.
• Pass-wall, 60' range, 6-turn duration, 5'
opening up to 10' deep.
• Wearer is immune to turn to stone and
charm attacks, except his own reflected
gaze.
• Wearer is immune to poisons from living
creatures.
Handicap: When the mask is put on, the
wearer's Charisma is reduced to 4 (see Notes).
The mask cannot be removed or disguised while
the wearer lives.
Penalty: Successful use of detect magic or flesh
to stone reduces the wearer's own Strength by 1
for one hour. The successful use of any other
power reduces the wearer's own Strength by 2. If
the wearer's own Strength is reduced to 0, he dies.
Notes: This artifact is evilly enchanted and can
be detected as such. The wearer loses 1 point of
Charisma immediately when the mask is put on,
then more at the rate of 1 point per week until a
Charisma of 4 is reached. The mask, meanwhile,
will become progressively uglier and more evil-
looking. The use of any power by the wearer is
voluntary. If the wearer dies, he and his equip-
ment turn to stone with the exception of this arti-
fact. This artifact will shatter irrevocably if its gaze
is ever reflected by the Golden Mirror of Ka. The
wearer of the mask will be immediately stunned
for a full turn and will remember nothing of what
he did while wearing the mask, but he will be
otherwise unharmed.

Index to Spells

This is an index of all spells appearing in this
Cyclopedia. The spells are arranged alphabetically, and each spell has a notation beside it in
parentheses. The letter in parentheses stands
for the type of spell it is (C = clerical, Dr =

stands for the spell level (1 = 1st level, etc.).
Therefore, a notation such as "(C 7)" would
mean "7th level clerical spell." Spells with multiple notations appear in different places in the
