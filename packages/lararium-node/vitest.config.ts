/**
 * THE THRASHER CLASSES — the one place they are named, and the reader's only source.
 *
 * A suite standing any of these holds a live resource that starves the box under 12-way file
 * parallelism: a `repo.find()` races its sync to "unavailable", a nested-worker ESM import of an
 * EXISTING dist file reds ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND under FD pressure, a python holder times out. Each such
 * suite passes green alone, and a DIFFERENT set reds every run — the signature of contention, never
 * logic. The cure runs them in ONE serial project (`fileParallelism: false`) while the light files keep
 * their full-parallel project.
 *
 * `tests/heavy-roster-is-complete.test.ts` IMPORTS this array and applies it to every suite under
 * `tests/`, so a class named here is a class the reader checks. An earlier shape stated the classes in
 * prose here and re-encoded them as regexes there; the prose named three and the regexes covered two,
 * and four suites standing a python holder sat in the parallel project under a green reader. Two
 * hand-written lists of one fact drift, and the one that carries authority drifts silently. Add a class
 * HERE and the reader picks it up; there is no second list to forget.
