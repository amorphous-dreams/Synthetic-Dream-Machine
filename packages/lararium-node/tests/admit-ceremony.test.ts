/**
 * admit-ceremony.test.ts — the whole crossing, end to end, as a PURE FUNCTION OF ITS BYTES.
 *
 * A vessel FOUNDS a PersonaGroup. It ADMITS a second vessel by signing that vessel's edge. The admit is
 * CARRIED (never fetched) as bytes. The second vessel APPLIES it and comes up BOUND to the first — pinned
 * to a signer it could not have written for itself.
 *
 * Nothing here stands a relay, opens a socket, or reads a clock. That is not a convenience; it is the
 * DESIGN showing through. The admit is a signed capability, so it needs no trusted channel and no reachable
 * issuer — and a thing that needs neither is a thing you can test with two Repos and a string. A design in
 * which the vessel FETCHED its own admission could never be tested this way: it would need a server, a
 * reachable authority, and a moment at which both were true.
 *
 * The ceremony is platform-blind (ceremony-core imports no `node:` anything), so what passes here is what
 * runs in Ichi the browser vessel. This suite lives in node because it runs in milliseconds there.
