/**
 * wiki-sensorium-consistency (node tier) — S0 KEYSTONE witness, node substrate.
 *
 * The SAME hull runs here and in the browser tier (browser/tests/wiki-sensorium-consistency.test.ts):
 * `runWikiConsistencyWitness()` builds two wiki-causal-island fixtures (GLUE ⊥ OBSTRUCT), senses each
 * through the pure {@link WikiStoreAdapter} — composite-store `entries()` → structure⊥form projection →
 * the lifted `@lararium/mesh` Robinson radius — and returns both readings. This test asserts the
 * cross-tier verdict; the browser test asserts the IDENTICAL verdict on a Chromium substrate. One hull,
 * two substrates, differ by grant not hull — the island-isomorphism made a witness.
