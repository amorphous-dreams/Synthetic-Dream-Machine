/**
 * faceless-place-stands — the WAKING FLOOR is a place that boots.
 *
 * A founding splits in two: `vessel found` stands a PLACE that carries and serves the public shelf, and
 * `persona new 0` lights the first FACE on it. Between those two acts a vessel stands FACELESS, and the
 * runbook's own rite walks that window every time a human founds by hand.
 *
 * These vectors say what must hold there, and they name a shape no other suite reaches: every test in this
 * stack founds a face, so a faceless boot has no witness anywhere else.
 *
 *   V1 — wiring the daemon's verbs FACELESS never throws; a place that prints "the PLACE stands" boots
 *   V2 — face-scoped verbs refuse by NAMING THE LIFT, never by stack trace: the reactor reaches for no
 *        face when it is wired, so standing it costs the boot nothing and a caller learns what to do
 *   V3 — the place-scoped verbs register anyway — carrying and serving is what a faceless place IS FOR
 *   V4 — with a face, the persona verbs return
