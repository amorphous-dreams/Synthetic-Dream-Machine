/**
 * self-slot-circles — the circles doc FLEET-syncs same-operator, NEVER federates to a stranger (STRUCTURAL).
 *
 * The operator ruling: the follow-graph rides the sovereign circles Automerge doc, PRIVATE-but-fleet-synced
 * (matching the catalog registry) — a follow shows on ALL the operator's OWN devices, and NEVER on anyone else's. This
 * holds that posture structurally at the sharePolicy shore, no vessel booted:
 *
 *   · the circles doc is a PRIVATE bag: its random doc id sits OUTSIDE the DeterministicFederationGate's fixed
 *     federatable set {crossroads · who · kapae-antigen · members · persona-KEL}. A cross-operator peer is
 *     denied it even with the Nexus OPEN — only the public shelf crosses. (never-federates)
 *   · a SAME-OPERATOR WS peer full-syncs the circles doc (the device-fleet lane; empty relay ring → shared freely).
 *     (fleet-sync)
 *
 * A circles doc from ANOTHER key models the circles doc's own random private doc id — NOT in the gate built for
 * THIS Nexus, exactly as a private bag's id is not in the deterministic public set.
