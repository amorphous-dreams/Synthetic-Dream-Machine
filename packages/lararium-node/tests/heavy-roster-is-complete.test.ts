/**
 * heavy-roster-is-complete — the serial roster and its criteria both derive from the config.
 *
 * `vitest.config.ts` splits this package into a full-parallel project and a serial one, because a suite
 * standing a live resource starves the box under full parallelism. That split names its members in a
 * literal array (vitest needs one), and a literal array cannot notice a new member: a suite added
 * tomorrow that binds a listener joins the parallel project and re-opens the storm, surfacing later as
 * an intermittent red somewhere else that reads as flake and costs a day to trace back here.
 *
 * So the roster gets a reader. It imports {@link THRASHERS} — the config's OWN class list, not a copy —
 * walks every suite under `tests/` RECURSIVELY, and fails naming any file that matches a class while
 * sitting outside the array.
 *
 * BOTH OF THOSE WORDS CARRY WEIGHT, because an earlier shape lacked them and stayed green while wrong:
 *   · IMPORTS, never re-encodes. Re-stating the criteria here made this reader a second hand-written
 *     list of one fact. The config named three classes, this file encoded two, and four suites standing
 *     a python holder ran parallel under a green check. A reader that carries authority and misses a
 *     class is worse than no reader — a maintainer distrusts a bare array and believes a green test.
 *   · RECURSIVELY. A flat `readdirSync` cannot see `tests/e2e/`, so the reader was structurally blind to
 *     a whole directory it existed to police.
 *
 * A suite matching a class that belongs in the parallel project anyway earns a line in
 * {@link ALLOWED_LIGHT} with its reason — an exemption a reader can weigh, never a silent omission.
