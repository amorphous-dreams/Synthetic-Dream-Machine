/**
 * contracted-founding — a vessel that founds under a root it does not hold.
 *
 * A Herm holds no human key, so it cannot sign its own binding. A trusted operator signs the edge on THEIR
 * vessel and the Herm carries it — bind-by-edge in its purest case, since such a vessel cannot cheat by
 * holding a seed. What matters here: the carried bundle FOUNDS, the founded vessel holds NO persona root of
 * its own, and every way the bundle could belong to somebody else REFUSES before anything stands.
 *
 * The refusals carry the weight. A contracted founding trusts a hand that is not present, so it verifies what
 * it carries rather than the hand that carried it.
