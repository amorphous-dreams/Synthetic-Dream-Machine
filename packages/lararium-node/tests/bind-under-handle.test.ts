/**
 * bind-under-handle.test.ts — the PERSONAGROUP layer: two of a human's vessels BIND into one PersonaGroup so
 * they sync shared content (wikis), end to end through the REAL ceremony + boot + archive.
 *
 * LAYER NOTE (do not conflate): this proves the PersonaGroup — the vessel-binding that syncs content between a
 * human's own devices. It does NOT prove the HANDLE — the veiled-user pseudonym's SOCIAL announcement on the
 * DreamNet, which rides the separate `handle-card` (mesh/handle-card.ts). A PersonaGroup CARRIES one Handle,
 * but binding vessels (here) and announcing the Handle (publishing the card) are two distinct acts.
 *
 * The load-bearing content-sync core: the founder vessel mints
 * the joinee into its PersonaGroup (packPersonaCrossing), ships the membership as capEvents in the admit
 * payload, the joinee applies it (runApplyAdmitPayload → the daemon doc), then BOOTS restoring its own Archive so
 * its prekeys match the card the founder minted-to (bootDaemonKeyhive), hydrates, and decrypts the shared
 * content. No throwaway identity, no founder-card side channel — the crossing stands on the real path.
