/**
 * cabal-join — the applicant crosses, or learns which gate refused. End-to-end through the node.
 *
 * THE LAST TEST CARRIES THE WEIGHT. `admitToRealm` takes a vouch DAG already folded, so the
 * per-voucher cap — the choke on how much mass one hand injects into a lineage — falls to whoever
 * assembled the edges. `admitOnLineage` folds inside the gate, where it cannot be left out. A door
 * onto the wrong one of those two passes every test here except that one.
 *
 * A refused applicant ANERGIZES: it stays at the floor, and nothing is written on either outcome.
