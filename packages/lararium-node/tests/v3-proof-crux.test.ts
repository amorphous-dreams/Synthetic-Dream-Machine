/**
 * v3-proof-crux.test.ts — the browser↔node crossing fails at "V3 proof verification failed", for the anon
 * AND the admitted vessel alike. So the failure sits BELOW the admit, in the proof itself, and the whole
 * proof rests on ONE unproven assumption:
 *
 *   the keyhive ContactCard's identifier ENDS WITH the raw ed25519 verifying-key of the same seed.
 *
 * The gate derives the peer's key as `id.slice(-64)` off the card, and the leaf signs with the seed whose
 * raw pubkey it presents as `peerPubKey`. If those two keys are not the same bytes, every proof this system
 * ever mints verifies against the wrong key and fails — silently, and identically, for everyone.
 *
 * This test asks the assumption directly, with no browser and no relay, so the answer is a fact and not a
 * guess.
