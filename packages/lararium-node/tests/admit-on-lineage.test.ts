/**
 * admit-on-lineage — the crossing folded from the ISSUED INVITES, so no caller skips the per-voucher cap.
 *
 * `admitToRealm` takes pre-folded edges; a caller assembling them by hand silently loses the choke that
 * bounds any one hand's injection into the lineage. This shore takes the invites themselves. What matters:
 * the cap BITES here, what it turned away comes back VISIBLE, and with nothing capped the shore agrees
 * exactly with the manual path — so folding here costs no behaviour, it only removes a way to get it wrong.
