/**
 * carriage-reshare-sniff.test.ts — the RE-SHARE tooth: the relay's bag-tracker learns holders FROM THE WIRE.
 *
 * The carriage relay's `cid → holders` bag-tracker stood empty — the announce leg was never populated from the
 * wire. This proves the sniff + prune + re-announce round-trip:
 *   1. a holder broadcasts `cas-have(cid)` over the relay → the tracker NOTES `cid → holder` (the sniff),
 *   2. the holder DROPS → the tracker PRUNES that holder (an offline holder never lingers),
 *   3. the holder RECONNECTS + re-announces → the tracker RE-LEARNS it (the RE-SHARE),
 *   4. HINT-ONLY: the tracker indexes cids + holder keys, moves no bytes — a member re-verifies the bytes itself.
 *
 * REVERT-VERIFY: unwire the sniff (drop the `onEnvelope` note) → the announced holder never lands → step 1 fails.
 *
