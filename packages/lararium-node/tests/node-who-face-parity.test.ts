/**
 * node-who-face-parity — the ANCHOR and its LEAVES resolve the ONE WHO board.
 *
 * `openNodeVessel` composes whoFaceCap with its own gate key; a browser leaf composes the same cap with the
 * relayGatePubKey it dials. Those name the SAME string (a node anchors its confederation, so its gate key IS
 * the Nexus key its leaves pass back), and both sides reach the board through the deterministic crossroads
 * address. This witnesses that construction end-to-end: two independently-composed vessels, wired exactly as
 * the two openers wire them, land on one board and one composite layer — and neither publishes a face.
 *
 * Proving it here rather than through a live boot keeps the witness runnable: openNodeVessel founds a hearth.
