/**
 * realm-admission.test.ts — the shore admits on BOTH signals, and refuses at the first gate that fails.
 *
 * Four claims, four groups: the structural gate refuses BEFORE anything walks the price (invite-only, no invite);
 * a valid invite CROSSES and names the voucher (the co-pay stands); a cluster AT THE CEILING refuses on the
 * wall's own verticality; and `open` policy skips the invite but still PRICES — open never means free.
 *
 * THE APPLICANT BRINGS NOTHING. No budget rides here: the cost falls on the voucher by dilution, and the
 * convex wall refuses ITSELF by returning a non-finite price at r ≥ β. Nothing stands to compare against.
