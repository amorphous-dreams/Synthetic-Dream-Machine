/**
 * lease-rekey.test.ts — the RE-KEY tooth: roll a resource's lease epoch on the live daemon board, per-writer-slot safe.
 *
 * Proofs:
 *   1. A single roll reads the effective (max) epoch and writes effective+1 into the CALLER's own slot.
 *   2. TWO CONCURRENT rolls (two forks of a common ancestor — a clean CRDT split) each land effective+1 in their OWN
 *      slot; on merge the max never decreases, even asymmetrically (the max-register property the immune keel leans on).
 *   3. REVERT-VERIFY: a bare shared scalar (the hazard the per-writer slot forbids) DROPS a higher concurrent value
 *      on merge — Automerge's LWW picks one writer, discarding the other, so the counter can walk BACKWARD.
 *
 * The concurrency model FORKS from a common ancestor (`clone`) — merging two independently-`init`'d docs is not a
 * clean CRDT merge (no shared history → whole-map conflicts), so the fork is what a real two-replica sync enacts.
