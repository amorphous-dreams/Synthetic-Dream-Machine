/**
 * ciphertext-cas-seal.test.ts — the SEAL-PRODUCER lights the member blind-transit lane for a cad body.
 *
 * The load-bearing honesty proven end-to-end against the REAL member-carry decision + the REAL federatable gate:
 *   · the encrypt-on-CAS INSTALLER registers a sealed body's docId AS A SIDE-EFFECT (encrypt → CAS-write → register),
 *   · a MEMBER blind-transits that sealed ciphertext body (carry TRUE); the read-cap NEVER crosses the decision,
 *   · a STRANGER is DENIED the sealed body (public shelf only),
 *   · a PLAINTEXT body NEVER registers — no door but the encrypt path, so its docId reads unsealed (DENY),
 *   · READ-LANE UNTOUCHED — an empty registry behaves EXACTLY as the pre-split floor (carryContractShareDecision),
 *   · the ciphertext at rest verifies BLAKE3(bytes)==cid SECRET-FREE (the relay's blind check).
