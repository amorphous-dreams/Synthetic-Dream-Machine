/**
 * lease-fence-weld — the hand that ROLLS a lease and the hand that READS it must meet on one board.
 *
 * ── THE GAP THIS EXISTS TO CLOSE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `rollLeaseEpochOnBoard` writes a per-writer slot under `<daemon-bag>/lease-epoch/{resource}/`, on
 * the DAEMON board, via the `nexus-rekey` verb. A reader that scans a DIFFERENT document for that
 * prefix matches nothing, folds an empty slot-set, and reads epoch 0 — forever.
 *
 * Measured: the cabal admission fence read the VOUCH board. Every invite therefore compared against
 * 0, no bound could ever sit behind it, and no vouch could ever lapse. Both halves were individually
 * correct and no test made them meet, which is the shape of every weld this house has lost.
 *
 * A green fence proves nothing on its own. It has to fail after a real roll.
 *
 * ── AND ONE HAND MUST STAY AWAY ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The fence belongs to the CABAL, the feed to its REALM. A realm is the cabal's shared CRDT and
 * resources; admission is a fact about the collective, not about the stuff it holds. The fence bounds
 * outstanding invites — authority the admitting vessel holds alone. The feed is the heartbeat the
 * members keep together, and has to take a peer's write. They share a key only because a cabal carries
 * no identity of its own. The same weld that makes the first two meet must keep the third apart.
