/**
 * carriage-relay-node — the CARRIAGE relay service entrypoint (Socket B): a proof-of-possession authenticated
 * relay the family vessels dial to carry sealed cad ciphertext bodies hearth to hearth, plus the DHT-free
 * bag-tracker. Distinct from relay-node (the Herm's OPEN membership-CEREMONY relay); this is the member-gated
 * SEALED-body cad carriage (Socket B). Both are Herm transports; NEITHER is the Automerge /ws doc relay (Socket A).
 *
 * The relay reads no ciphertext, holds no read-cap, keeps no charter / keyring / roster; it stands from a 32-byte
 * gate seed + a bound port. The member gate lives on the vessels' cas-wire serve side, never here.
 *
 * Env: LAR_CARRIAGE_RELAY_PORT (default 8091) · LAR_CARRIAGE_GATE_SEED (64-hex; a fresh random seed mints if unset).
 * Run: LAR_CARRIAGE_RELAY_PORT=8091 pnpm exec tsx packages/lararium-node/probes/carriage-relay-node.ts
 * Meme: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/cabal-realm#/carriage
