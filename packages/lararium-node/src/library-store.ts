/**
 * library-store — the node-fs shore for the ACQUIRED tier: take a body in, keep it readable, verify it back.
 *
 * The pure half (the layout law, the reference grammar, the index) lives in `@lararium/mesh`'s library-tier.
 * This is the disk: where the tier stands, how a body enters it, and what a verify actually reads.
 *
 * ── IT BELONGS TO THE HOUSE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * A shelf is the LARARIUM's, never any Lar's — a family's books outlast whoever reads them. So it homes in
 * `<lararium>`, and everything else follows: the runtime CAS under `<lares>/vessel` is licensed for the wipe by
 * one premise, that its blobs rebuild from the bags carriers on each seed, and that premise holds for
 * DERIVED blobs while failing completely for acquired ones — a book regenerates from nothing. Standing in
 * its own house rather than one directory aside from a house every rite pares is what makes that structural.
 *
 * ── ACQUIRING MOVES, IT DOES NOT COPY (by default) ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The point of the act is to get a body OUT of a tracked tree. A copy leaves the original exactly where it
 * was doing the harm, so `acquire` MOVES and says so; `--keep` exists for a source the operator does not own.
 *
 * ── VERIFY READS BYTES, NEVER RECORDS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A verify that trusted `meta.json` would certify its own bookkeeping. This re-digests the body and checks
 * it against the DIRECTORY name — the one value nothing but a re-write can move — so a tampered sidecar
 * reads as a mismatch rather than as agreement.
 *

 * BOTH ISOLATION ARMS MATTER. A rehearsal that set only `LAR_LIBRARY` and a rehearsal that set only
 * `LAR_ROOT` are equally isolated; a comment naming one would send a reader to reach the operator's
 * real shelf while believing otherwise.
 *
 * IT STANDS IN THE SHRINE, NOT THE SPIRIT. `lares/vessel` is the substrate `reset` and `regenesis`
 * reforge, and an acquired body survives neither on its own merits: it has no author in any tracked tree
 * and no parse∘render fixed point, so nothing re-derives it and a wipe that reached it would end it.
 * Standing it under `lararium/` makes that structural — the tier survives because it lives in another
 * house, never because a directory stayed off somebody's list.
 *
 * The env override exists because a shelf grows without bound and an operator may want it on another
 * disk — the one resource here likely to outgrow its default.
