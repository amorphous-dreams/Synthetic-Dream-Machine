/**
 * uds-channel — the co-located fast path of the lares↔lararium binding.
 *
 * The daemon already holds the WARM daemon replica and the worker VerbDispatcher.
 * A co-located `lares` CLI never needed its own leaf replica + sync-on-connect (the
 * ~3s/command tax) — it only needs to hand the daemon a capability-bearing
 * invocation and await the receipt. This Unix-domain socket carries exactly that:
 * the CLI writes one invocation line, the daemon writes the summons into its warm
 * daemon doc (the SAME tiddler the worker reacts to from a WS peer), awaits the
 * durable bags/daemon/outcomes/<id> receipt, and returns it over the socket.
 *
 *   transport  = this socket (kernel-local, authority-agnostic)
 *   authority  = the invocation's requestedBy → the worker's verify-then-delegate
 *   record     = the CRDT outcome tiddler (unchanged — idempotent, re-queryable)
 *
 * Content routing (the co-located bypass): the CLI and the daemon worker share ONE
 * process, so the carriers (tiddler/meme/blob CONTENT in `args`) ride the DIRECT
 * worker channel (`placeVerb` → postMessage → the worker's volatile invocation),
 * NEVER the daemon Automerge doc. The daemon's own doc carries only the VERB-record's
 * durable OUTCOME/receipt (`bags/daemon/outcomes/<id>`, written by the dispatcher) — the
 * command's result, never its content. A remote peer that lacks the shared process
 * still writes a summons over WS sync (that path keeps content in the CRDT by
 * necessity — no channel bypasses the network); the co-located path skips it.
 *
 * THE CHANNEL SERVES ITS VESSEL'S CLAIM. The vessel claimed the store's rendezvous name before it opened its Repo
 * (`claimStore`), and that one socket answers here once the vessel serves verbs: no second bind, no instant when
 * the name stands free, and no unlink of a path some other holder answers at. Closing the channel refuses every
 * later caller by name while the vessel flushes; the claim itself lets go only with the vessel.
 *
 * Auth (v1): socket perms 0600 (owner-only) gate PRESENCE — only the operator's own
 * uid opens it; the requestedBy did rides the summons for cap-derivation. A signed
 * Ed25519 proof over the socket is the federation/attenuation hardening (follow-on);
 * the WS path keeps the full V3 gate for genuine remote peers.
 * See lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/api/lares-lararium-binding.
