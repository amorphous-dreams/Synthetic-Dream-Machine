 * ── A WRITE LANDS OVER A SEALED CARRIER ONLY UNDER A KEY THAT OPENS IT ──────────────────────────

 * it booted — a fresh, empty identity. Landing that over the sealed bytes replaces the sovereign
 * identity with nothing. The floor wears TWO shapes and both reach this writer:
 *
 *   · NO key (`key-absent`) — the write would land CLEARTEXT over ciphertext, and every later boot
 *     would read the archive as unsealed;
 *   · a WRONG key (`key-wrong`) — the write SEALS, so no cleartext test catches it, and the
 *     sovereign archive comes back readable only under a passphrase that never sealed it. Measured:
 *     `vault rotate` old→new, then one stand under the OLD passphrase, and the identity is gone.
 *
 * ONE INVARIANT covers both: the current key must OPEN what stands on disk before anything replaces
 * it. The seal governs the WRITE as well as the read, so a mistyped passphrase destroys nothing.
 *
 * The deliberate policy-movers do NOT pass through here — `vault seal`, `rotate`, `repair` and
 * `export` stage their own atomic writes in `archive-passphrase.ts`, each having already opened the
 * carriers under the CURRENT key. This guard governs the boot-time re-seal alone.
 *
 * The write throws (the exporter warns and carries on) and the sealed bytes stand.
