/**
 * cas-wire — the cad WIRE CONSUMER: a member CARRIES a sealed ciphertext body peer-to-peer over a real
 * request-response hop, gated by the member blind-transit lane, and the immune denial draws Mu on the same hop.
 *
 * THE TRANSPORT. The request-response rides the swappable `MembershipChannel` (offer/poll, deliver-once,
 * vessel→vessel) — the InMemory impl stands a real two-vessel hop for the proof; a live-WS impl drops in behind
 * the SAME interface, so the wire logic here never changes. A member `want-block(cid)`s a holder; the holder
 * answers a `cas-block` (the ciphertext) or `cas-mu` (the void).
 *
 * THE GATE (carry ⊥ read ⊥ contract). On a `want-block`, the server consults `carrierShareDecision` over the
 * cid's docId (`docIdForCiphertextCid`): a proven Nexus MEMBER over a PROVABLY-sealed plane opens the carry lane
 * and the server serves the CIPHERTEXT; a STRANGER, a NON-member, or a KAPAE'd presenter draws Mu. The server
 * serves ciphertext only — the read-cap NEVER rides this shore (it stays on the private keyring), so a member
 * carries what it may not be able to read (carry ⊥ read), and the requester re-verifies `BLAKE3(ciphertext)==cid`
 * SECRET-FREE (verify-cap) before trusting a byte.
 *
 * MU BYTE-INDISTINGUISHABILITY (denial ≡ satiety). The server draws the IDENTICAL `muVoidBytes()` for BOTH a
 * DENIED presenter (non-member / Kapae'd) AND a NOTHING-TO-SERVE peer (the cid is not held / already caught up).
 * An adversary reading the wire cannot tell "you are banned" from "there is nothing here" — the void closes the
 * surveillance shore at the same stroke it closes the immune one. A successful carry (`cas-block`) is naturally
 * different bytes — the indistinguishability is between DENY and CAUGHT-UP, never between deny and a served body.
 *
 * NO-GLOBAL-NOW: the antigen the gate consults is a local replica read as-of-last-sync — a partitioned peer sees
 * a ban only after re-sync (bounded, never instant). The antigen MUST be quorum-signed (the gate's `AntigenRing`
 * folds only quorum-verified bans) — never a lone-node censorship weapon.
