/**
 * discordian-date — the Erisian reckoning, computed rather than shelled out for.
 *
 * `ddate(1)` ships with util-linux on many machines and with none of them reliably; a vessel that asked an
 * external binary for a date it can compute would fail on the machines that lack it and drift on the ones
 * whose version differs. Five seasons of 73 days, five weekdays, and St. Tib's Day outside both — the whole
 * calendar fits in one function, so it lives here.
 *
 * ST. TIB'S DAY SITS OUTSIDE THE WEEK AND OUTSIDE THE SEASON. February 29th is neither a weekday nor a day
 * of Chaos: it is intercalary, and every day after it in a leap year keeps the ordinal it would have had in
 * a common year. That is the one rule an implementation usually gets wrong, and getting it wrong shifts
 * every date in ten months of a leap year by one.
