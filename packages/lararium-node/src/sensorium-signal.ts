/**
 * sensorium-signal — the auto-extraction PROJECTOR: read a poured target sensorium's child streams into a
 * `ChildSignalMV[]` signal-matrix, the shape the coupling/flow instruments read (couple_r · mismatch · flow).
 * Where sensorium-coupling reads each child's STATIC salience sidecar (the sheaf / H¹-gate path), this reads
 * each child's per-ordinal TIME-SERIES (the R-effective-TE / Gaussian-CMI path) — two representations of the
 * SAME `coupling.children` cover, each feeding its own instrument family.
 *
 * THE RE-POUR INVERSION — stable ground now, feature-gated (the no-lean discipline: the plumbing lands, only
 * its DATA-signal calibration waits on the re-pour). Today no poured sensorium carries an extractable
 * per-child signal: the single-stream corpuses (mark-twain · memory) host NO children — a coupling matrix
 * needs ≥2 coupled streams — and the mesh lobes (who ⊥ authority ⊥ flow) stand declared with empty streams.
 * So the extraction STRUCTURE lands now — a pluggable per-child reader, shared-ordinal alignment, the honest
 * <2-child floor — and the default reader reads a `signal.json` sidecar the re-pour will land per child.
 * Absent (every real sensorium today) ⇒ the child drops (never fabricated), the matrix reads empty, and the
 * flow/couple/mismatch surface NAMES the calibration data-wait rather than couple an empty matrix.
 *
 * THE CALIBRATION (the one genuine data-wait). What scalar/vector series a child carries per ordinal — an
 * embedding-innovation, a salience, a rhythm tick — and the shared time axis the children align on, settles
 * with the re-pour that lands child streams. The sidecar interface fixes the SHAPE now; the re-pour fills it.
