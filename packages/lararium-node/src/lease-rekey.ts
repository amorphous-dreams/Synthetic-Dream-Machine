/**
 * lease-rekey — roll a resource's LEASE EPOCH forward on the live daemon board, per-writer-slot safe.
 *
 * The NON-RENEWAL half of revocation (lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/convergent-mesh): a grant names a
 * `boundEpoch`; the grant goes cold the moment the resource's lease epoch rolls past it. Rolling the epoch
 * is how a Herm STALES every outstanding grant on a resource at once — the immune keel's RE-KEY tooth at the
 * Herm's own tier. Targeted key-MATERIAL rotation rides keyhive CGKA (`orichalcum-capabilities`), NEVER this
 * lease — the lease stales, it never re-derives a secret.
 *
 * WHY A PER-WRITER SLOT, NEVER A BARE SCALAR. The epoch rides a MAX-REGISTER held as per-writer slots
 * (`epoch-lease`): each writer owns exactly one tiddler (`bags/daemon/lease-epoch/{resource}/{writer}`), so
 * last-writer-wins WITHIN a slot stays safe (one owner holds it). The effective epoch = max over every slot.
 * Two hearths rolling the SAME resource concurrently each land effective+1 in their OWN slot, so on merge the
 * max only ever climbs. A bare shared scalar would let Automerge's LWW DROP a higher concurrent value — the
 * counter walking backward, un-staling a grant a roll had already cut. The slot-map forbids exactly that.
 *
