/**
 * recovery-share-store — persist / load the DEVICE recovery share in the sovereign identity home,

 * rides the exact same self-only seal guard as the keyhive archive (CIV-4, archive-seal): it seals
 * through `asSelfSovereignSecret`, and a held/citizen principal's share can NEVER reach this sealer.
 *
 * WHY only the device-share persists here: the recorded-code share leaves as words the citizen writes
 * down (never stored), and the escrow share leaves to a peer (relayed, never held openable). Only the
 * device-share stays on THIS device, at rest — and it dies with the device, which is exactly why it is
 * NEVER the recovery path (recovery rides {recorded-code, escrow}). This store is for normal-life
 * quorum assembly, not for surviving device loss.
