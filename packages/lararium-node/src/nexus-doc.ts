/**
 * nexus-doc — the DISK adapter for the Nexus SEAL FILE, which carries THREE joints at three cadences.
 *
 * THE JOINTS, and why they ride separate blocks. One word once covered six entities, separated not by
 * content but by different ceremony, threshold, RATE and authority (canon `cabal-realm#six-joints`). Three
 * of them live here, and their amendment costs differ by orders:
 *
 *   · SEAL     — the pre-rotated key-epoch lineage. A rotation ceremony over a k-of-n of current keys. Rare.
 *   · KAHU     — the founding roster + its threshold. Moves when a steward seat moves.
 *   · PRACTICE — federation posture · join policy · admission dials. An ordinary governance act, fast and
 *                reversible, and the one a single hand may turn.
 *
 * WHY THREE BLOCKS RATHER THAN ONE. A single block forced every writer through a whole-doc rewrite, so a
 * posture flip re-emitted the seal lineage's bytes on its way past, and two hands touching different joints
 * clobbered each other last-writer-wins. Each narrow writer below re-reads the carrier at write time and
 * swaps ONLY its own fence, carrying the other joints through as OPAQUE TEXT it never deserializes. That
 * makes the corruption inexpressible rather than merely discouraged: a practice write holds no parsed seal
 * to get wrong.
 *
 * The composed `readNexusDoc` still folds all three into one `NexusDoc`, because a reader legitimately wants
 * the whole view — the WRITE must stay narrow, never the read.
 *
 * FAILS CLOSED on the read: an absent file, a missing seal or kahu block, torn JSON, or a wrong-kind payload
 * all read `null` — the roster then folds empty and the antigen stays inert. The parser never guesses a
 * partial doc into authority. A torn PRACTICE block never closes the doc, so the fastest-cadence joint can
 * never take the slower ones down with it.
 *
 * The seal home rides in as a parameter (the CLI supplies `larSealHome()`), so this module keeps no env
 * coupling and tests against any temp tree.

<<~ ahu #the-three-joints>>

! The nexus Doc — seal · kahu · practice

Three joints ride here at three cadences, each in its own block, because a single block forced every writer through a whole-doc rewrite: a posture flip re-emitted the seal lineage on its way past, and two hands touching different joints clobbered each other. Each narrow writer swaps ONLY its own fence and carries the rest through as opaque text.

The KAHU block holds the APPROVED roster the Kapae immune antigen reads. A ban/lift act carries ${doc.threshold}-of-${doc.kahu.length} founding-kahu signatures, rooted on the seal epoch below. Each kahu's key reads that PersonaGroup's own root-derived verifying key, seated from the vault by \`lares nexus seal seat\` — never invented. An unseated key reads null, and the antigen stays inert until a quorum stands.

Seated: ${seated}/${doc.kahu.length} · threshold ${doc.threshold} · epoch ${doc.sealEpochCid ?? "(unestablished — seat a quorum)"}${lineageLine}
