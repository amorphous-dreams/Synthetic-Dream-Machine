/**
 * lan-address — derive the reach-faces a vessel actually answers on.
 *
 * The server binds `0.0.0.0`, so it answers on EVERY interface the host holds. A banner that names
 * only `localhost` therefore under-reports the vessel: the operator standing at a phone reads a name
 * that resolves, on that phone, to the phone itself. The vessel knows its own interfaces; it says them.
 *
 * Everything here stays PURE — it takes the interface table as an argument and returns strings. The IO
 * (calling `os.networkInterfaces()`, printing the banner) lives at the boot shore in main.ts. That split
 * lets the whole derivation run under a fixed interface table in a test, with no host to depend on.
 *
 * `LAR_PUBLIC_URL` leads when the operator sets it: a declared reach-face names what the OPERATOR made
 * reachable (a tunnel, a reverse proxy, a name in DNS), which the interface table cannot see and must
 * never override.
