/**
 * seal-reserve-store — the node adapter for the charter reserve keel: it SEALS the operator's "mine"

 * reaches disk at all) — the vessel keeps only ONE Shamir share of it (custodian "device"), sealed exactly
 * like the recovery keel's device-share, so an at-rest read of the vessel reveals a single share → nothing.
 *
 * Two carriers, both in the sovereign identity home (`larIdentityDir`, outside every substrate wipe):
 *   · the SEALED "mine" share (`seal-reserve-mine-share.bin`) — self-sovereign secret material, sealed
 *     through the same `asSelfSovereignSecret` wall the recovery device-share rides,
 *   · the PUBLIC reserve state (`seal-reserve-state.json`) — the pre-rotation commit + guardian labels +
 *     a sealed-share flag. It carries NO seed and NO share bytes, so `reserve show` reads it freely.
