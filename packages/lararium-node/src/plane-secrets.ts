/**
 * plane-secrets — which planes hold SECRETS whose whole value rests on staying unpublished?
 *
 * A reach credential (a foreign app secret a vessel holds so a human posts outward from their wiki) stops
 * meaning anything the moment it goes world-readable. So its plane floors at CONTRACT, and the tier keystone
 * meets every declaration against that floor — a secrets bag declaring PUBLIC comes straight back down.
 * Publishing one becomes impossible rather than forbidden.
 *
 * THE NAME CARRIES THE PROPERTY, NEVER THE INSTANCE. Credentials arrive first; anything whose bytes lose
 * their meaning on publication belongs here beside them.
 *
 * ── WHY A REGISTRY AND NOT A LABEL, AND HOW THE SEVERITY DIFFERS FROM plane-seal ─────────────────
 * The seal registry exists because a doc claiming //sealed// would claim a LOOSENING — a false claim there
 * opens a blind-transit lane over cleartext, so registration rides strictly as a side-effect of the encrypt
 * path and a doc can never self-label. A doc claiming //secrets// claims a TIGHTENING, which the keystone
 * permits from any source, so the same claim here could not disclose anything.
 *
 * It still rides a registry, for two reasons worth keeping in view. The floor names what the STRUCTURE is,
 * not what a doc says it is, and a floor that read a claim would stop being structural. And a false secrets
 * claim, while it discloses nothing, DENIES — an adversary able to write a plane label could quietly stop a
 * public bag from ever federating, which surfaces as nothing at all rather than as an error.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED reads the other way here than in plane-seal, and deliberately: an empty registry answers false,
 * so an unregistered doc floors by its OTHER readings. Nothing is silently protected, and nothing is silently
 * published either — a secrets store that never registers simply never gains the extra floor, which surfaces
 * the moment its bag reads publishable.
