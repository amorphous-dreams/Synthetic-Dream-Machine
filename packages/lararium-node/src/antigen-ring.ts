/**
 * antigen-ring — the node holder that makes the Kapae-antigen BREATHE on the live sharePolicy path.
 *
 * It stands the `AntigenRing` (mesh federation-gate) the node's `carryContractShareDecision` consults:
 *   · presenterNym(peerId) — the main↔worker cap-verify BRIDGE. The DaemonAuthGate already proved a
 *     peerId↔verifying-key binding (its in-worker keyhive returned the peer's Identifier hex into
 *     `peerIdentifierMap`); this resolver SURFACES that proven nym — it never re-authenticates. The
 *     Identifier hex's last 64 hex chars ARE the raw ed25519 verifying key (operator-daemon-behavior
 *     `id.slice(-64)`), the exact `nym` the charter roster + antigen entries key on. An unresolved /
 *     unauthenticated peer → null (fail-closed: a denylist that cannot name a peer never falsely denies it).
 *   · kapaed — the currently-Kapae'd nym set, FOLDED (kapae-antigen `foldAntigenSet` + the multi-sig quorum
 *     verifier) from the always-carried antigen BOARD entries AND the kahu quorum's seats read off disk
 *     (`readNexusDoc(sealHome)` → `foundingRoster`). Re-folded on every board-doc change so a ban
 *     propagated across the mesh takes on the next sync (the immune system saturates by carry-contract).
 *
 * FAILS CLOSED, three ways, matching the antigen's own discipline:
 *   · an absent / unseated charter → empty roster → the verifier ignores every entry → NOTHING Kapae'd
 *     (correct: no quorum, no bans — never allow-all, never false-deny).
 *   · an unverified board entry → ignored at the fold (never trusted).
 *   · an unresolvable presenter → presenterNym null → not on the denylist → NOT falsely denied AND not
 *     specially trusted (it still faces the rest of the sharePolicy composition upstream).
 *
 * The antigen is a DENYLIST: its absence (board not yet synced, roster not yet seated) means NO bans, so a
 * cold/empty ring denies nobody — availability-open, trust-closed. This is the pono fail-closed for an
 * immune antigen (a lone node MUST NOT manufacture a ban).
