/**
 * ws-membership-channel — the LIVE-WS impl of the membership shore (MembershipChannel)

 * the swarm ceremony above never learns which transport carries it.
 *
 * The relay is DUMB — it re-broadcasts each envelope to every OTHER connected client;
 * the client buffers inbound + filters on poll (addressed-to-me OR broadcast, never
 * from-me). Membership envelopes are opaque routing payloads (contact card, admit,
 * invite) — NOT Automerge sync — so this carries NONE of the anti-relay sync gate
 * (the cap-wall); it is a plain message relay.
 *
 * Node-side (the transport branch); the shore + the file impl stay platform-blind.
