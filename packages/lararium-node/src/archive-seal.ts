/**
 * archive-seal (node atom) — seal / unseal the keyhive secret archive at rest (G1).
 *
 * The archive carries RAW prekey secret material. This wraps it in an AES-256-GCM envelope
 * (`@lararium/mesh` frames the layout) so a stolen disk yields ciphertext, not the sovereign
 * identity's secrets. AEAD = authenticated: a flipped byte or a wrong key fails `final()` —
 * a tamper reads as a hard error, never silent plaintext.
 *
 * KEK POLICY (operator ruling 2026-07-16 — passphrase-primary, keychain-conditional): the
 * key-encryption-key derives from an operator PASSPHRASE via scrypt (pure node:crypto,
 * survives a reboot — the WSL2-safe default, since an OS keychain there can land the KEK in
 * the kernel's in-memory keyutils cache and brick the identity on reboot).
 *
 * The OS-keychain leg rides two independent gates, and needs BOTH. `secret-service-probe` asks
 * the machine whether a REBOOT-SURVIVING store answers — a live probe of bus name ownership,
 * every unknown reading absent. `keychainBindingPresent` asks whether this build can reach one.
 * The leg therefore stays dark wherever either half is missing, and it NEVER silently degrades
 * to weak key handling.
 *
 * HONEST FALLBACK: with no passphrase configured, the archive stays CLEARTEXT (bare bytes,
 * unchanged behaviour) with a one-time warning — a random key stored beside the ciphertext
 * would be obfuscation posing as isolation, so the shore refuses it rather than fake safety.
 *
 * The RECOVERY keel is device RE-ADMISSION (mint a fresh device key, re-admit through the
 * mesh/group — the Ink&Switch/Fission model), not this at-rest seal. Sealing is hygiene.

 * was right all along, and hides a corruption behind a credential error. `readArchiveOpening` reads its five
