/**
 * discordian-reader — read the Erisian date from `ddate(1)` where it stands, and compute it where it does not.
 *
 * THE OPERATOR PREFERS THE REAL DDATE (ruling, 2026-08-08), and it earns the preference: the util-linux
 * binary carries formats the calendar alone does not — holyday names (`%N`), the Erisian exclamations (`%.`),
 * days until X-Day (`%X`), and the whole `%{…%}` shape. A vessel that reimplemented all of that would be
 * reimplementing a program that already ships.
 *
 * ── BUT THE PASSPHRASE STAMP NEVER READS IT, AND HERE IS THE MEASUREMENT ─────────────────────────
 * `ddate`'s own output shape varies by invocation. Measured on one machine, one binary, one day:
 *
 *     ddate            → "Today is Setting Orange, the 1st day of Bureaucracy in the YOLD 3192"
 *     ddate 1 3 2028   → "Setting Orange, Chaos 60, 3194 YOLD"
 *
 * Two shapes from one program. A value that rides a key-derivation cannot depend on that: an operator who
 * sealed under one shape and unsealed under another would be locked out of their own vault by a formatting
 * difference. So the STAMP always comes from the computed calendar (`discordianStamp`) — deterministic,
 * version-proof, and byte-stable — while the PROSE prefers `ddate`, because prose is for reading.
 *
 * ── THE PARITY CHECK EARNS ITS KEEP ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Where both stand, the reading compares them. Agreement is worth nothing to assert and disagreement is
 * worth everything to surface: it names either a `ddate` this code has not met, or a leap-year rule this
 * code got wrong — and the second is the one that hides for four years at a time.
 *
