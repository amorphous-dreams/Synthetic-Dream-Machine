/**
 * vessel-raise — the live door: what a vessel currently STANDS as, and how a recogniser moves it.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS HOLDS NOTHING ON DISK ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A raise is PRESENCE. It lives exactly as long as the process holding it, and a reboot drops the vessel
 * back to its floor with nothing to resume. That is what keeps `SEATED ⊥ RAISED` true at rest: the
 * vessel's at-rest state never changes, so a stolen disk yields nothing of anybody's person. Writing a
 * standing raise anywhere would re-open the bearer-credential hole the challenge nonce exists to close.
 *
 * So this module holds two things in memory and offers no persistence shore at all — not as an omission,
 * as the ruling.
 *
 * ── THE LIVE CHALLENGE DROPS AFTER ONE ANSWER, WHICHEVER WAY IT WENT ────────────────────────────
 * A challenge that survived a refusal would let an attacker grind against one nonce. A challenge that
 * survived a SUCCESS would let the same grant raise the vessel twice. Both readings end at the same rule:
 * one challenge, one answer, then gone — and asking again mints a fresh nonce.
 *
 * ── AND THE FENCE STAYS READ LIVE, NEVER CACHED ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `standing()` re-reads the lease epoch every time rather than remembering what it read. A raise ends by
 * NON-RENEWAL, so a cached epoch would keep a vessel raised past the roll that should have dropped it —
 * the one failure mode this fence exists to prevent. Nobody performs a lowering act here; the reading
 * simply stops coming back raised.
 *
 * ── ONE CHALLENGE PER BOOT, UNTIL THE ASK VERB STANDS ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * The Herm emits a challenge in its boot output, which is the whole of the vessel's half today. So a
 * refused answer burns the only challenge that boot carried, and a second attempt waits for a restart.
 * That reads as INCONVENIENT rather than unsafe — the burn is the property, not the cost — and it lifts
 * the moment `raise ask` stands as a daemon verb and a recogniser can provoke a fresh nonce on demand.
 *
 * ── AND IT STANDS ON THE HERM BRANCH ALONE, WHICH IS A RULING ──────────────────────────────────
 * A hearth already carries its caps: its operator opened its archive, which is the ① act itself. A raise
 * adds nothing there — `standingClass` on a `hearth` floor answers `hearth` either way. The door belongs
 * where a vessel stands at the floor and someone else arrives: the crossroads.
