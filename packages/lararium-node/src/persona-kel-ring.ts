/**
 * persona-kel-ring — the node holder that stands the per-Nexus persona-KEL BOARD live on the main thread.
 *
 * It materializes the always-carried KEL board (mesh deterministic-doc `personaKelBoardDocUrl`) under its
 * deterministic id, keeps a per-prefix chain map folded from the board entries, and RE-FOLDS on every
 * board-doc change — so a rotation propagated across the mesh takes on the next sync (the identifier→head
 * mapping saturates by carry-contract, bounded by sync-latency, NEVER a global now). The board reads a LOCAL
 * replica: a prefix the replica has not yet synced surfaces a null head, and the Binding-Gate walk denies.
 *
 * The holder serves TWO reads:
 *   · chainForPrefix(prefix) — the RAW seq-sorted key-event-log for one persona, handed to the worker at boot
 *     (threaded via daemonAuth.personaKel.chain). The worker RE-VERIFIES it — this is transport, not trust.
 *   · headOpKeyForPrefix(prefix) — the fully-verified current head op-key (structural + every rotation quorum),
 *     or null on a broken / unreachable / unquorumed chain (fail-closed). The live read a gate wants.
 *
 * FAILS CLOSED: a board that never resolves (cold boot, sync not yet landed) leaves the chain map empty, so
 * every prefix resolves to a null head — a KEL that cannot reach a head DENIES, it never opens an allow path.

/**
 * ── THE CLIMB'S CARRY MOVED TO MESH, and the reason reads as a MEASUREMENT rather than tidying ────
 *
 * The carry reaches nothing but a Repo and mesh's own board reader, so it was platform-blind from the day
 * it was written — and housing it on THIS shore is what kept the browser leaf from composing it. Measured:
 * `open-browser-vessel` stands the SAME fail-closed Binding Gate ("a chain the replica does not carry HALTS
 * the boot") and could not import this function, so a whole vessel class stood brickable on the walk this
 * function exists to cure. The body now lives at `@lararium/mesh` → `persona-kel-climb`, beside
 * `climbNexusBoards`, whose header already vowed that both shores compose the identical call.
 *
 * Re-exported HERE so the node boot's import and its vectors keep naming one door. The ruling, the
 * refusals and the at-boot-not-at-the-rite reasoning live in the mesh module's header — read it there.
