/**
 * nexus-carriage — the node holder that answers the nexus-doc CARRIER-vs-STRANGER consult on the live
 * sharePolicy path (the carry-split's carriage gate). "Carrier" names a contracted vessel, never a
 * Cabal member — the two relations run orthogonal (carriage-registry).
 *
 * The mesh breathes across a Nexus because a cross-operator the nexus doc names a MEMBER blind-transits a
 * sealed private plane (carry the ciphertext, never the read-cap); a STRANGER reaches only the public shelf.
 * This holder stands the `NexusMembership` the node's `carrierShareDecision` consults, reading the
 * node's OWN nexus-doc replica (as of last sync; no global now — never a global truth).
 *
 * THE MEMBER SET = the seated-KAHU floor ∪ the folded operator MEMBERS-registry (members{}). Two sources,
 * unioned, each fail-closed:
 *   · the seated-kahu FLOOR — the founding-kahu charter ROSTER read off `bags/nexus` (`seatedKahuKeys`).
 *     Every seated kahu IS a contracted member (a strict subset), so it stands even when the members board is
 *     empty / unsynced — the conservative floor that never over-grants.
 *   · the MEMBERS-registry — the quorum-signed, contract-in members{} board (the antigen's ALLOW-twin), folded
 *     through `foldCarriageSet` against the SAME charter roster the antigen folds against. A general contracted
 *     operator (not a kahu) reads MEMBER off THIS source — which is what LIGHTS SELF-SLOT-B: the carry-split's
 *     member gate now names contracted operators, not kahu alone, so a contracted peer would blind-transit a
 *     sealed plane the moment a sealed plane type registers (planeSeal is DENY-ALL today; the lane stands ready).
 *
 * The board fold is OPTIONAL: without a `repo` + `nexusPubkey` the holder stands the kahu-floor alone (the prior
 * behavior, fully preserved), so a caller that has not yet wired the board still gets the conservative floor.
 *
 * NYM RESOLUTION reuses the antigen's proven binding: the DaemonAuthGate already keyed a peerId → verifying-key
 * Identifier hex into `peerIdentifierMap` (this holder SURFACES that nym, never re-authenticates). An
 * unresolved / unauthenticated peer → NOT a member (fail-closed: a node never assumes a peer is Nexus-pono).
 *
 * FAILS CLOSED, every way:
 *   · an absent / unseated charter → empty roster → the members fold ignores every entry AND the kahu floor is
 *     empty → NOBODY reads member (every cross-operator STRANGER). No quorum, no members.
 *   · an unverified / contract-in-short members entry → ignored at the fold (never trusted).
 *   · an unresolvable / malformed presenter → no nym → NOT a member.
 *   · the members board not yet resolved / synced → the kahu floor alone stands (never a false member).
 *
 * USER-NEVER-WRITTEN: this holder reads operator-pubkey nyms ONLY (kahu keys + members{} nyms). A user leaves no
 * roster trace, so nothing a user does ever enters this set — there is no surface here to hold a user.
