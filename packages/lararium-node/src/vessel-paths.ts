/**
 * vessel-paths — the ONE resolver for the operator's runtime vessel state, consolidated onto the
 * XDG Base Directory layout (freedesktop.org). Persistent bytes, ephemeral scratch, transient runtime,
 * durable state, and config each land in their proper XDG home instead of one `~/.lares` monolith:
 *
 *   $XDG_DATA_HOME/lares    (~/.local/share/lares)  — THE SPIRITS' OWN: the sovereign identity, the
 *                                                     Nexus seal, the repo registry, and the vessel
 *                                                     substrate they run on. A Lar's keys ARE that Lar.
 *   $XDG_DATA_HOME/lararium (~/.local/share/lararium) — THE HOUSE'S OWN: the acquired library and the
 *                                                     SENSORIUMS — operator history and DreamNet
 *                                                     history, capture the machine took once and cannot
 *                                                     take again. LARES PASS; THE LARARIUM ABIDES — and
 *                                                     the wipe zone stands structural in consequence,
 *                                                     a tier held by its house rather than by a list.
 *   $XDG_STATE_HOME/lares   (~/.local/state/lares)  — WATERMARKS ALONE: harvest, harvest-stage,
 *                                                     projection. All of it re-derives.
 *   $XDG_CACHE_HOME/lares   (~/.cache/lares)        — ephemeral scratch: sensoriums (swept).
 *   $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lares  (~/.config/lares)       — config.json.
 *   $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/lares  (tmpfs, or os.tmpdir()) — transient spool (+ future sockets/locks/pids).
 *
 * The SENSORIUM consolidation (SHEAF-TRUE): content ← the contentpalace, structure ← the structurepalace,
 * form ← the formpalace, ALL THREE co-located under `<lararium>/sensoriums/memory/{content,structure,form}`
 * so the filetree IS the composition (sensorium.ts). The lararium OWNS its content plane: the sovereign
 * contentpalace inherits mempalace's exact base schema, holds content internally under the abiding home,
 * and adopting a user's mempalace history runs as a deliberate one-way import Act (`guest-import.ts`),
 * never a runtime binding. bands + coupling are BASE caps — they live in the manifest, never as dirs.
 *
 * The mesh federation store lives as its OWN `mesh` SENSORIUM that `#has` three nested child sensoriums
 * (WHO · AUTHORITY · FLOW) under `<lararium>/sensoriums/mesh`, the children hanging below it. The mesh's own
 * caps stay minimal — its STRUCTURE is the three children, each carrying its own thin manifest.
 *
 * Every resolver answers the canonical XDG dir deterministically — one canonical home, no `~/.lares`
 * fallback arm. The env shores
 * (`LAR_ROOT`, `MEMPALACE_PALACE_PATH`) are preserved and win.
 *
 * `LAR_ROOT` overrides the home root for ISOLATED instances (the test harness / staged pairs): each
 * pair gets its own tree with the XDG facets laid out beneath it (`<root>/data`, `<root>/state`, …),
 * so isolation holds and the UDS socket path always agrees. Both the CLI (local-connector) and the
 * node daemon (uds-channel) resolve through HERE.
 *
 * ── THREE HOMES, ONE QUESTION ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every siting answers WHOSE IS THIS?, and the answer picks the house:
 *   `<lararium>`  the LARARIUM's — the acquired shelf, the sensoriums. Back it up; nothing re-makes it.
 *   `<lares>`   the LARES' — their identity and seal, and the substrate they run on. Back it up.
 *   `<state>`  nobody's for long: watermarks, deletable at any moment, each re-deriving from what it
 *              watches.
 *
 * THE WIPE ZONE STANDS AS A HOUSE, NOT A LIST. `reset` pares `<lares>/vessel` and `<state>/projection`;
 * `<lararium>` shares no prefix with either, so the tier a wipe must never end survives by its ADDRESS.
 * A tier kept safe by sitting one subdirectory aside stays safe only until somebody widens the wipe by a
 * path segment; a tier standing in another house leaves no edge to widen.
 *
 * A rule that fits in one breath needs no warning label.
