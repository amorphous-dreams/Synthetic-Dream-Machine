/**
 * authenticated-membership-relay — the LIVE-WS `MembershipChannel` transport with REAL Ed25519 auth, so the
 * cas-wire member gate reads a PROVEN peer identity, never a self-asserted one.
 *
 * WHY AUTH BINDS TO THE ENVELOPE `from`. cas-wire's `carrierShareDecision` gates the sealed-body carry on the
 * requester's peer id (the envelope `from`). A DUMB re-broadcast relay lets a peer CLAIM any `from`, so a stranger
 * could name a member's id and be served the ciphertext. Carry ⊥ read bounds that (a stranger reads nothing without
 * the read-cap), but the member lane's carry-restriction wants a PROVEN id. This relay closes that: a connecting
 * peer proves it HOLDS its verifying key (an Ed25519 proof-of-possession — the SAME challenge/sign/verify the
 * DaemonAuthGate runs, reused here, never weakened), and the relay then STAMPS every envelope's `from` with that
 * proven key. A forged `from` cannot cross — a peer speaks only AS the key it proved.
 *
 * NOT A SEPARATE TRUST ROOT. This reuses `mkLarChallenge` + `verifyAuthProof` (the DaemonAuthGate's own
 * proof-of-possession primitives) — isomorphism-by-composition, not a weakening: the automerge-coupled DaemonAuthGate
 * stays the automerge relay's gate; this stands the SAME Ed25519 mechanism for the membership transport. The relay
 * holds NO read-cap and reads NO ciphertext — it moves opaque envelopes (want-block / cas-block / cas-mu) that ride
 * ciphertext + verify-cap only (carry ⊥ read ⊥ contract; verify-cap ⊥ read-cap), so a compromised relay leaks nothing.
 *
 * NO-GLOBAL-NOW: a peer's membership + Kapae status the cas-wire gate reads is a local replica as-of-last-sync — this
 * transport proves WHO a peer is, never adjudicates membership (that stays the cas-wire gate's local read).
 *
 * Node-side (the transport branch); the `MembershipChannel` shore + the file impl stay platform-blind.
