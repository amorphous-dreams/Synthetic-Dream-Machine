/**
 * bag-tracker — the relay-side `cid → holders` index that makes cad discovery DHT-FREE.
 *
 * THE DISCOVERY AUTHORITY (canon: hint → peers → bag-tracker). A member fetching a sealed body broadcasts
 * `want-have(cid)` to its session peers and to the relay serving its Nexus; the relay answers from THIS index —
 * which members announced they hold that cid. That index REPLACES the global DHT stock Bitswap would fall to, so
 * discovery stays inside the Nexus causal island. A DHT, if ever added, sits behind an `oracle`-plane rendezvous (its
 * own causal-island boundary) — NEVER this path.
 *
 * SECRET-FREE, PLAINTEXT-BLIND. The tracker indexes CIDS and HOLDER handles only — never a body, never a read-cap,
 * never a per-Nexus secret. A cid is a self-proving content-address (`BLAKE3(ciphertext)`); the tracker moves no
 * bytes, so it can leak no plaintext. It is populated as a SIDE-EFFECT of a member sealing/announcing a body
 * (`noteInstalledBody` off `installSealedBody`) — the same encrypt-on-CAS path that lights the member lane.
 *
 * NO-GLOBAL-NOW. The index is a relay-LOCAL view: it holds what members have ANNOUNCED as-of-last-sync, never a
 * global truth of who holds what. A holder that drops offline lingers until `forget` prunes it; a member reads
 * "holders as the relay last heard", then verifies the fetched bytes itself (`verifyCiphertextCid`) — the tracker
 * is a HINT, never an authority on the bytes.
