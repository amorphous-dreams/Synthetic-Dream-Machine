/**
 * Lararium Node Vessel — local-first relay + TW5 engine entrypoint.
 *
 * Boots one LarVessel per configured wiki, wires a WebSocket relay for
 * browser vessels to sync through, and attaches a LarDiskProjector so
 * the bags/ tree stays in sync with the Automerge store.
 *
 * Three surfaces mount here, not one:
 *   ws://localhost:{port}/ws     → Automerge sync protocol (browser + remote mesh peers)
 *   /tmp/lares-<uid>/<digest>.sock → UDS verb channel (the rendezvous; co-located CLI fast path)
 *   http://localhost:{port}/…    → oracle read-face; federation pulls + verifies through it
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node dist/main.js [--port 8080] [--wiki lares] [--root /alt/root]
 *
 * Environment:
 *   LAR_PORT     — server port (default 8080; docker-compose.yml overrides to 4321)
 *   LAR_WIKI     — wiki id (default lares — the lares-as-wiki quine)
 *   LAR_CATALOG  — existing catalog automerge URL to join (optional)
 *   LAR_ROOT     — alternate repo root for all mirror paths (default: monorepo root).
 *                  Set to an isolated test dir so promote/sync writes never touch
 *                  canonical packages/ or wikis/ paths.
 *
 * Bootstrap:
 *   The boot prints the catalog Automerge URL to stdout.
 *   Browser vessels read it from location.hash on first visit, cache to
 *   localStorage for offline return visits.

  // PersonaGroup onto this place — names what the vessel HOLDS; a place founded and no face yet holds a
  // crossroads, and composing a hearth over it reaches for a face during boot and takes its own standing
  // with it. The ARCHIVE opening names what the vessel can OPEN right now; a hearth whose archive holds
  // shut carries, serves the public shelf, and holds every sovereign act closed until a key arrives.
  //
  // `--recipe herm` DECLINES the lift — a public crossroads an operator means to keep faceless — rather
  // than selecting a different kind of thing. Nothing is ever lowered here: a vessel that cannot open
  // simply never rose (canon: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/waking-floor).

  // The class stays orthogonal to the CEILING. `personaSlotCeiling("herm") === 0` bars a SEATED persona
  // root on a crossroads; standing at the floor for want of a face bars nothing — `lares persona new`
  // reads its own ceiling and lights the face that lifts the next boot. MAY-HOLD-A-FACE ⊥ HOLDS-ONE-NOW.
  // THE READING CARRIES ITS REASON, AND THE FLOOR MUST SPEAK IT. `readArchiveOpening` answers five
  // kinds — `key-absent`, `key-wrong`, `unreadable`, `nothing-sealed`, `no-seal-expected` — and a boot

  // ── Graceful, DURABLE shutdown (flush-then-force) ────────────────────────────
  // A bare process.exit() (or a SIGKILL escalation when the handler runs too slow)
  // while an island writes DESYNCS the actively-written doc — the recurring
  // "working never arrived over syncPort" gap. The reliable path:
  //   1. stop new inbound work (uds + http + read-face),
  //   2. flush the MAIN replica FIRST — the guaranteed durable floor for every doc
  //      that has already synced (this completes before any force-exit),
  //   3. tear down the wiki islands (disposeAll → each island flushes its OWN
  //      partition, incl. working, before it acks),
  //   4. tear down the daemon island gracefully (it flushes its docs + capture WAL),
  //   5. flush MAIN again to capture anything that synced during teardown.
  // A hard budget guards the whole sequence: if a worker jams in keyhive WASM
  // and never acks, the force-timer fires — but ONLY after step 2 has already made
  // the synced state durable (flush-then-force, never force-before-flush).
  //
  // The budget MUST beat the incumbent-stopper's grace window: `lares vessel stand --restart`
  // (port-control.stopIncumbent) sends SIGTERM, polls for ~8s, then SIGKILLs. So
  // the whole graceful sequence has to FLUSH AND EXIT under 8s, else the SIGKILL it
  // exists to avoid lands anyway. Default 6s leaves margin; the per-island
  // handshakes resolve in <1s when responsive, and the force-timer caps a jam.
