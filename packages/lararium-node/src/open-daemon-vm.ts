/**
 * openDaemonVm — node host wrapper over the shared daemon-VM core.
 *
 * The lifecycle lives in @lararium/tw5 `openDaemonVmCore` — ONE core both
 * vessels compose. This file supplies the node platform pieces:
 *   - spawnWorker  : worker_threads Worker (.on / .postMessage)
 *   - newSyncChannel: worker_threads MessageChannel
 *   - daemonHandle  : waitHandle (merge-on-late-arrival strategy)
 *   - recipe       : built here from libraryBags; storage = nodefs dir
 *
 * Node-ahead capability proxies (authShore verify-proxy, resolveBinding) compose
 * on top via a second listener on the core's exposed worker handle — they are
 * node-only surface the browser has not built yet, not duplication.
 *
 * Boot ordering: `workerEa` resolves only after the daemon island sends `ea`.
 * `openNodeVessel` awaits it before emitting `"live"`.
 *
 * Meme: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/node/open-daemon-vm
