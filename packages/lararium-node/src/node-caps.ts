/**
 * node-caps — the node vessel's #has-cap-stack, wired by the composable-keel engine.
 *
 * A vessel = a #has-cap-stack (the flat, dependency-blind set of cap-modules it HAS); `composeVessel`
 * reads the stack and topologically WIRES the live components, handing each a POLA-scoped resolver.
 * Vessel-kinds are different STACKS, never feature-flags, and the difference runs BASE-THEN-LIFT. The
 * composed stacks each vessel actually stands, measured at a live boot:
 *
 *   BASE      substrate · daemon · meshpalace · carriage · who-face   — every vessel that carries
 *   LIFT      wikislot · wiki · pool · mount                          — added when a FACE stands
 *   CROSSROADS  read-face · bulb                                      — added when an httpServer stands
 *
 * BASE + LIFT = a Lararium. BASE + CROSSROADS = a Herm. The three groups compose by what a vessel HOLDS
 * — a face, an http floor — never by a kind-flag it was labelled with. CROSSROADS belongs to the vessel
 * that serves an http floor rather than to the Herm as a kind: a hearth composes no read-face because
 * its opener hands it no server, and a browser leaf could hold no such thing at all.
 *
 * A stack that never declares the wiki/pool caps routes nothing to them (blind by structure, not flag).
 *
 * The ISOMORPHIC carriage machinery (meshpalace + carriage caps, MeshSelf, the routing helpers) now
 * lives DOWN on the mesh floor (`@lararium/mesh` carriage-caps) so a BROWSER vessel composes the very
 * same caps. node-caps RE-EXPORTS them (existing importers keep resolving) and owns only the node-ONLY
 * `flowMapReadFaceCap` (the http disclosure wire) + the two node cap-stacks.
 *
 * Two node stacks ride here:
 *   - composeHerm — BASE + CROSSROADS: substrate (the oracle island + social plane), the daemon immune
 *     core, the carriage pair (a writable meshpalace FLOW-map + the puller that fills it), the read-face
 *     that serves that map, and — where a genesis stands to hand — the bulb. NO wiki, NO pool.
 *   - composeLararium — BASE + LIFT, wired by `composeCoreVessel` (wiki-slot, wiki, pool, mount); its
 *     opener composes the carriage pair alongside. The daemon rides BOTH — the immune core, present
 *     from founding — and its registerBags omits the user-wiki bags where no wiki stands: the decouple.
 *
 * The carriage pair rides one shared builder (`carriageStack`, mesh floor), so the hearth, the Herm and
 * the browser leaf carry the SAME two caps and differ only in the mesh standing each hands in.
