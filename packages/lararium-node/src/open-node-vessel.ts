/**
 * openNodeVessel — local-first Node.js vessel factory.
 *
 * A thin opener over the composable-keel engine. Node supplies the platform atoms (NodeFS storage,
 * WS relay + DaemonAuthGate, worker_threads pool) and the capability pieces it holds (the inbound
 * gate, the corpus loader, the residual pool/repo verbs, the main-resident BagStowage mechanism).
 *
 * `prepareNodeBoot` builds those atoms + the keel + the boot closures ONCE, and BOTH entry-points
 * run it: the doors differ only in which #has-cap-stack they compose over the one preparation.
 *   - openNodeVessel → composeLararium — a hearth: the base course plus the caps a FACE lifts.
 *   - openNodeHerm   → composeHerm     — a crossroads: the base course plus the caps an HTTP floor
 *     serves. No wiki, no pool; the daemon stays, the immune core every vessel carries, and its
 *     registerBags omits the user-wiki bags where no wiki stands.
 * Each stack is declared at its compose site and derived by `composeVessel`; read it there.
 *
 * The node vessel holds no semantic privilege. It carries roads, docks, and sync; live VM state lives
 * in sovereign islands (daemon + wiki). FPI-5 (trim tab): all Node-specific code lives here.
