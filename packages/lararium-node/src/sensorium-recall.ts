/**
 * multi-graph-recall — P4 of the living-grammar palace: the RRF MULTI-graph query that FUSES the
 * palace's several graphs into ONE ranking. Today the two live legs are the CONTENT graph (the
 * verbatim mempalace — dense embeddings, the drawers) and the FORM graph (the `.formpalace` "form"
 * collection — sparse fuzzy-constructicon vectors, the moves); the STRUCTURE (`.structurepalace`),
 * worldline, and federation graphs slot in as further legs with ZERO core change.
 *
 * The graphs stay ORTHOGONAL (each asks a different question — *what was said* · *how the grammar
 * moved* · *what shape recurred* · …); they rejoin ONLY here, in app code, on one shared key — the
 * `verbatim_sha` — fused by Reciprocal Rank Fusion (k=60). "Fusion IS the hash-join" (living-grammar-
 * palace #dual-graph). A drawer ranking in MORE legs accrues more RRF contributions, so a cross-
 * confirmed move naturally outranks one present in a single graph at comparable rank.
 *
 * The fold is split in two:
 *   - {@link fuseMultiGraph} — the PURE N-ary rank-fusion + verbatim_sha join (no I/O; the testable
 *     core). It takes a LIST of weighted, ranked graph legs and RRFs over all of them.
 *   - {@link multiGraphRecall} — the orchestrator: run the injected searches (content + form live by
 *     default, plus any extra graphs), build their legs, then fuse. The APERTURE knobs ride here:
 *     `formWeight` tilts the form leg, `register`/`grammarLayer` scope it by metadata where-filter,
 *     and `apertureGrain` (P6) re-weights the fused ranking toward the paragraph-scale basin-peak.
