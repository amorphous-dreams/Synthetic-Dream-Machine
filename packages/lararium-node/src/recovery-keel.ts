/**
 * recovery-keel (node) — the founding-split + recover-readmit flows, wired to node shores.
 *
 * The recovery FLOWS live in @lararium/mesh (recovery-keel-core) — platform-blind, over the crypto
 * primitives already in mesh. THIS adapter binds them to the two node-only edges the core cannot hold:
 *   · the KEYHIVE re-admit edge-signer (`runReadmitEdge`) — injected because keyhive DEPENDS ON mesh, so
 *     mesh importing keyhive would cycle; the core reconstructs the branded root and hands it here.
 *   · the FS-backed PersonaVault — supplies the root seed to split + the sealed device-share store.
 *
 * The lone-citizen truth stands unchanged: a founding split is 2-of-3 {device, recorded-code, escrow-peer};
 * a drowned device (its share gone) recovers from {recorded-code, escrow}. Neither party recovers alone —
 * the recovery quorum IS the impersonation quorum (recovery-share enforces it at the TYPE wall).
