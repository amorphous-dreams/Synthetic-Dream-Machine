/**
 * sensorium-coupling — the READER that makes `coupling.children` load-bearing (it was write-only). The
 * setup path STAMPS `coupling.children[]` on the mesh + memetic-wikitext trees, but nothing ever READ
 * them back — the coupling plane sat decorative. This module resolves those child edges → the child
 * sensorium dirs → each child's SECTION over a shared comparison stalk → the H¹-GATED fusion
 * (@lararium/mesh `fuse`):
 *
 *   • H¹ = 0  → FUSE: the children's pairwise agreements admit a global section — diffuse toward the
 *               consensus (Chebyshev sheaf-Laplacian), return the fused pseudosection.
 *   • H¹ ≠ 0  → HOLD-OPEN: a genuine cocycle (pairwise-agreeing, globally obstructed) — never averaged,
 *               surfaced as SIGNAL with its reconciliation cost `R*_sem = log₂ dim H¹`, routed to Talk-Story.
 *
 * The read reads H¹ BEFORE it diffuses (the cohomological-gate law) — so the coupling merge never
 * fabricates a global-now it cannot ground. With fewer than two readable children the read reports
 * `fusion: null` (insufficient — the honest no-coupling), NEVER a silent average.
 *
 * Each child becomes ONE sheaf plane; its per-unit salience over the shared stalk comes from the
 * pluggable {@link ChildRestriction}. The default reads an optional `saliences.json` sidecar (a
 * `{unit: value}` map the parallel writes per child); a child with no sidecar drops out of the fusion
 * (graceful — never fabricated). The comparison stalk is the UNION of the readable children's observed
 * units (the engineered overlap; disjoint peers glue vacuously and the note says so).
