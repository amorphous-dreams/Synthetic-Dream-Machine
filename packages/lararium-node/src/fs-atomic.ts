/**
 * fs-atomic — crash-safe file write via write-temp → fsync → rename → fsync-dir.
 *
 * A plain `writeFileSync` can be TORN by a crash mid-write, leaving a half-written file — fatal for
 * watermark/state JSON (a torn idempotency watermark loses exactly-once tracking) and for the identity
 * keel (anchors + keyhive archive). The cure holds two disciplines together:
 *   - ATOMICITY: write a sibling temp then `rename` over the target — rename is atomic within one
 *     filesystem, so a reader/crash sees the whole old file or the whole new one, never a tear.
 *   - DURABILITY: `fsync` the temp FILE before the rename (its bytes reach disk), then `fsync` the
 *     containing DIRECTORY after (the rename's dirent survives a crash). `rename` alone gives the
 *     atomic pointer-swap but NOT durability — a crash can leave the swap or the bytes un-flushed.
 *
 * The temp rides the SAME directory as the target (so the rename stays intra-filesystem = atomic) and
 * carries the pid (so concurrent writers never share a temp path).
