/**
 * seal-carrier-federation — the cad seal's FIRST live producer: seal a staged carrier body into the ciphertext
 * federation plane, ADDITIVELY, beside the cleartext-local corpus CAS the wake path reads.
 *
 * TWO LAYERS, TWO JOBS, COMPOSED (never fused). The cas-stage shore already keeps an oversized carrier body OUT of
 * the CRDT: it writes the CLEARTEXT bytes to the corpus CAS + rides a skinny `textCid` handle, and the local wake
 * resolves it cleartext (the operator's own island holds its own read-cap — no seal needed locally). This producer
 * adds the OTHER job: it seals the SAME body's plaintext into the cad ciphertext plane (`cid = BLAKE3(ciphertext)`)
 * so a CROSS-OPERATOR member may blind-transit the bytes and read NOTHING (carry ⊥ read). The dual representation —
 * a cleartext-local copy + a ciphertext-federated copy — IS the carry⊥read split made concrete: two consumers
 * (local wake vs cross-operator carry), two representations. It NEVER touches the cleartext resolveByCid wake read.
 *
 * VERIFY-CAP ⊥ READ-CAP: the sealed body's cid is `BLAKE3(ciphertext)` — a relay recomputes it holding NO secret
 * (`verifyCiphertextCid`); the read-cap (the message-locked key) rides the private keyring, never the relay. The
 * seal registers the ciphertext docId into the live `SealedPlaneRegistry` as a side-effect, opening the member
 * blind-transit lane for exactly that body — a cleartext body reaches no encrypt path, so nothing self-labels sealed.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED: a vessel with NO convergence keyring (`keyring.current()` throws on empty) seals NOTHING — the body
 * stays cleartext-local only, never a plaintext body registered sealed. The caller catches the throw and skips.
