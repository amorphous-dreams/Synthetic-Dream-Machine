 * plane-seal — the ENCRYPT-FIRST guard on the carry-split: which planes are PROVABLY sealed, so a member

 * THE SEAL-STATUS FINDING (surfaced fork, fail-closed). Only a plane whose bytes are CIPHERTEXT (BeeKEM-
 * sealed) or IMMUTABLE (content-addressed CID) may blind-transit — carrying a cleartext plane would leak
 * plaintext and breach the read-lane denial the split MUST keep absolute. TODAY the automerge sync wire
 * carries CLEARTEXT documents: the private planes rest on random-16-byte doc-id obscurity, not per-doc
 * crypto (federation-gate's own HONEST BOUND; the BeeKEM/CGKA read-floor is design-intent, not yet enforced
 * on the sync wire). So NO private plane is provably sealed, and the correct floor is DENY-CARRY of every
 * plane: the member blind-transit lane stands ready but stays INERT until a sealed plane type lands.
 *
 * WHEN a sealed plane type stands — the `cad` ciphertext-addressed CAS (`cid = BLAKE3(ciphertext)`, verify-
 * cap ⊥ read-cap) or BeeKEM-on-the-sync-wire — register its docIds here (a set / a predicate over the doc's
 * seal marker), and the carry-split blind-transits exactly those. The gate and its fail-closed discipline
 * stay put; only the oracle's affirmative set grows.
