/**
 * carriage-relay — the CARRIAGE capability as a live, registrable service: the authenticated membership relay
 * (Socket B, ciphertext envelopes) PLUS the DHT-free `cid → holders` bag-tracker, composed into one startable unit.
 *
 * WHAT IT CARRIES, WHAT IT NEVER HOLDS. The carriage relay moves opaque ciphertext envelopes (want-block / cas-block
 * / cas-mu) that ride verify-cap only, stamps each envelope's `from` with the sender's PROVEN Ed25519 key, and holds
 * the bag-tracker HINT index (cids + holder handles, secret-free). It carries NO read-cap, reads NO plaintext, keeps
 * NO charter / keyring / roster — a compromised carriage leaks nothing (carry ⊥ read ⊥ contract). It stands from a
 * 32-byte gate seed + a bound port and nothing else, so a bare hearth stands one with a single call.
 *
 * TWO SOCKETS STAY TWO. This carriage (Socket B) SEPARATES from the Automerge `/ws` doc relay (Socket A, cleartext
 * CRDT behind the DaemonAuthGate) — cleartext CRDT never routes through here, so carry ⊥ read holds at the transport.
 *
 * ISOMORPHISM BY COMPOSITION. It re-uses `startAuthenticatedMembershipRelay` (the proven Ed25519 proof-of-possession
 * transport) and `makeBagTracker` (the discovery index) VERBATIM — it re-derives no gate, no crypto, no index.
 *
 * NO-GLOBAL-NOW: the bag-tracker reads "holders as the relay last heard", never a global truth; a member re-verifies
 * every fetched byte itself (`verifyCiphertextCid`), so the tracker stays a hint, never an authority on the bytes.

 * fresh random per boot). The one shore the boot's relay-standing gate reads for its seed.
 *
 * ── WHY A DERIVATION AND NOT THE SEED ITSELF ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This once returned `vesselSeed` unchanged, so a Herm's relay gate key WAS its vessel identity key — the same
 * Ed25519 pair signing device delegations and board writes, published to every hearth that dials the crossroads.
 * Nothing leaked (Ed25519 over domain-separated messages is safe under key reuse), and two costs still landed:
 *
 *   · IT LINKED TWO TRUST DOMAINS PERMANENTLY. The transport identity and the vessel identity became one
 *     correlatable key, which is exactly the join the veil model spends its whole design preventing.
 *   · IT BROKE THE HOUSE'S OWN CRYPTO RULE. One key, two purposes, no `info` between them.
 *
 * The prose already claimed the cure — the runbook says the gate key "derives from this Herm's OWN identity" —
 * so the document described a derivation the code never performed. The derivation now matches the words.
 *
 * HMAC-SHA256 yields exactly the 32 bytes an Ed25519 seed takes, and the same domain-tagged-MAC shape
 * `persona-scope` uses one level down, so the house carries ONE separation idiom rather than a second one.
