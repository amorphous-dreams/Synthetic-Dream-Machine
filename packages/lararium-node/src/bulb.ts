/**
 * bulb — the corm-and-rhizome BULB cap: a HELD cold-boot snapshot that carries its own next generation.
 *
 * The bulb = "seed-inside" (vessel-caps): the whole ALL-PUBLIC boot material a stranger needs to kindle their OWN
 * sovereign hearth — the genesis oracle seed, the engine + plugin CAS bytes, the social bootstrap pointers, PINNED
 * to a charter chain-head epoch. A Herm HOLDS it and serves it FROZEN offline / self-refreshed online (the oracle-
 * substrate corm-lease). It hands the FIRE (engine + genesis + grammar) — NEVER a key: the kindled hearth mints its
 * own sovereign self-certifying key from first breath (`kindleFromBulb`), so carry ⊥ read holds (the bulb carries
 * public boot material; the new hearth's keys never touch the Herm).
 *
 * ALL-PUBLIC → the PUBLIC FLOOR ONLY. The bulb rides the read-face (oracle-substrate) EXCLUSIVELY — NEVER the cad
 * carriage (Socket B). Routing a public artifact through the seal/keyring lane would collapse the OPEN path into
 * CLOSED (crypto-spine ledger #1: the cad seal ⊥ the ECDH box). Bulb ⊥ stolon: the bulb is the OPEN path (a stranger
 * births their own sovereign hearth); the stolon is the CLOSED path (invite a device into YOUR fleet).
 *
 * CONTENT-ADDRESSED. Every piece (seed, bootstrap, cas-manifest, each engine/plugin blob) is named by its own
 * sha256; the manifest lists the cids. A puller re-verifies `sha256(bytes) == cid` on every blob BEFORE it trusts
 * a byte — the serve stays a HINT-free content-address, no signer needed for integrity (the pointer adds freshness).
