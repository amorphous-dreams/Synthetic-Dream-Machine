/**
 * sensorium-square — the JING read: the li∘ki square over a child-hosting sensorium's cover. Where `li`
 * reads grain-gluing within one stream and `ki` reads flow-coupling across peers, JING reads the JOINT —
 * whether a node's lobes express ONE coherent trained force, or whether the grain and the flow fail to
 * round-trip. It is neither leg; it composes both and measures their commutation on the children-nerve.
 *
 * THE ROUND-TRIP (the map pair). The cover is the sensorium's `coupling.children` — for the load-bearing
 * mesh sensorium, the WHO ⊥ AUTHORITY ⊥ FLOW lobes the node federates onto DreamNet. Each lobe carries a
 * local section over the shared cid stalk. The square runs the two composite maps:
 *   • EXTEND (ki, local→global): `fuse` the lobes into a consensus — the reconciled self.
 *   • RESTRICT (li, global→local): carry that consensus back down to each lobe and compare to its own section.
 * The node COHERES (radius 0) exactly when extend-then-restrict returns the identity — every lobe's local
 * view equals the reconciled self restricted back. A residual pushes the radius positive, LOCALIZED to the
 * offending lobe: the self stops cohering THERE — the map the node shows the mesh diverges from the
 * territory it holds. When the extension itself holds open (H¹≠0), the lobes admit no common self at all.
 *
 * This carries the sheaf `H¹` obstruction the canon names for the square (Hansen–Ghrist cellular-sheaf
 * cohomology on the cover-nerve) — a DIFFERENT obstruction from the TE-flow circulation (te-hodge), which
 * reads local curl on the flow-graph; JING never certifies off that circulation, nor it off this. The two
 * stand complementary at two grains: this glues the self on the nerve, that reads coupling on the flow.
 *
 * The lobes wear working handles (who/authority/flow, or the child names) — no presupposed "coherence
 * quantity" is named and then hunted; the read files each lobe by what it carries and lets the shared cid
 * stalk narrow them. Inflationary ⊥ deflationary stays live.
