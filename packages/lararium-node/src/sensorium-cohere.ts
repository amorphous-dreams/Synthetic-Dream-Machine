/**
 * sensorium-cohere — the READER that makes the li-radius (H⁰ gluing) load-bearing over a sensorium's
 * OWN sheaf planes, the sheaf twin of {@link readCoupling}'s cosheaf coupling read. It resolves the
 * planes the manifest declares `sheaf` (`planeVariance` → `"sheaf"`), reads each plane's SECTION over a
 * shared cid stalk, and runs BOTH mesh organs over the one assignment:
 *
 *   • {@link consistencyRadius} — the Robinson li-radius: do the planes AGREE on the shared cids
 *     (radius 0 ⟺ a global section glues), and WHERE do they disagree (the localizable loci).
 *   • {@link fuse} — the H¹ gate over the SAME assignment: FUSE (H¹=0, the sections admit a global
 *     section) or HOLD-OPEN (H¹≠0, a genuine cocycle routed to Talk-Story, never averaged).
 *
 * THE BOUNDARY, NOT THE CODOMAIN. The radius certifies a health verdict ONLY at a LIVE boundary — the
 * SAME plane read across two contexts (island A ⋈ island B, pass ⋈ pass) that share cids, where H¹ can
 * genuinely stand nonzero. The DEFAULT read here glues a sensorium's OWN `content ↠ structure ↠ form`
 * planes, which NEST (structure carries the bulk of a record's bits) and so agree by construction — a
 * tautological 0 the mesh math cannot catch (`consistencyRadius` flags `vacuous` only for an EMPTY
 * stalk, never for a non-empty nested cover). So this reader carries the guard the mesh lacks: the
 * default single-stream cover reports `dependenceRisk: "nested-cover"` and reads as a PLUMBING witness
 * (the planes plumb through to the same cids), never as health. A caller that supplies its own
 * {@link PlaneReader} — the same plane over two contexts — asserts a live boundary and clears the flag.
 *
 * COVER-AGNOSTIC by construction: the reader takes a cover (the sheaf planes + a per-plane section
 * reader), never a hardcoded plane triple, so the ONE organ serves whichever boundary earns the cap.
 * It keys by cid and reads planes by declared variance — media-general; text pours first.
