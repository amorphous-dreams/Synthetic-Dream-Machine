/**
 * vessel-dyads — the live read path onto `mesh/dyad`: what relationships does this vessel hold?
 *
 * ── WHY A BRIDGE RATHER THAN A MIGRATION ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `mesh/dyad` names a relationship first-class — one human's relationship with one device — and until
 * this module nothing outside its own unit test ever called it. A model specified in code and reached
 * by no live path reads as built and behaves as absent.
 *
 * The bridge costs nothing to take. It mints no key, changes no wire format, and touches no ceremony:
 * a delegation edge ALREADY names a relationship, and this presents it as the thing it already is.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT REFUSES TO INVENT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A dyad read from an edge carries `binding: null`, because nothing has signed one. That absence
 * travels rather than hides: `fleetOfGroup` gathers only bound dyads, so an unbound one joins no
 * fleet and cannot pass as a gathered member. Presenting the relationship and claiming its gathering
 * are different acts, and only the first one has happened.
 *
 * THE VEIL STANDS RULED (Stage 0, 2026-09-05): it derives off the VESSEL seed per group
 * (`deriveDyadVeil`) and rides the dyad slot the ceremony writes. A slot WINS the union below, so a
 * ceremony-minted vessel reads its true derived face here; only a pre-ruling doc with no slot falls
 * back to the edge's (device × root) reading, and that fallback carries `binding: null` visibly.
 *
 * ── THE TWO SOURCES, UNIONED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A vessel holds its edge at ONE key today — `DEVICE_DELEGATION_SELF_TIDDLER`, a single `self` —
 * while `DYAD_SLOT_PREFIX` exists so a vessel carrying three faces carries three slots. Reading both
 * means the count follows the vessel rather than the reader: the day slots start landing, this returns
 * more without changing.
