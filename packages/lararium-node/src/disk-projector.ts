/**
 * LarDiskProjector — bag-aware unidirectional projection: store → disk.
 *
 * Co-projection model: the operator's mind
 * originates; the disk carrier and the CRDT record-set both PROJECT that
 * origin, each in its native grain — disk holds whole markdown memes, the
 * doc holds tid-sized records, the VM decomposes for transclusion. Merge
 * authority routes through the CRDT alone; this projector renders the disk
 * co-projection and NEVER reads from disk — that direction belongs to the
 * ingest path (file watcher → store.put).
 *
 * Bag-aware: each writable bag may opt into a filesystem mirror via
 * BagMirrorConfig. Bags without a mirror config never write to disk. The two
 * projection surfaces split by bag role (see api/lararium/disk-projection):
 *   - wiki content (@<slug>)      → `wikis/{slug}/...`   (projection / output)
 *   - seed/canon bags (lares/lararium/sdm) → `bags/NAME/...` (seed / canon)
 * State/runtime bags (personal/draft/temp/daemon) carry no mirror.
 * A residency MOVE (the canon ACTION verb)
 * that relocates a tiddler between bags has the disk side effect of a file move
 * between surfaces; the git diff IS the operator's signature on the change.
 *
 * Projection law (Fontany-Fuller-Zelenka):
 *   Disk projection RENDERS, never string-copies. The ONE render shore
 *   (`carrierFileFn`, the VM's `exportCarrierFile`) hands back the carrier's own
 *   filetype: a memetic carrier recomposes to `.mem` (expandMemeRefs over its
 *   group), any other TW5 filetype rides the file-info cascade to its native
 *   file (+ a `.meta` sidecar where the type needs one). The VM registry decides
 *   type + extension + bytes; the projector only sites at `<uri-path><ext>`.
 *
 * Group routing (carrier-whole at rest, disk-projection#projection-routing):
 *   memetic-wikitext records form a tiddler-group keyed by the carrier root.
 *   A child change climbs `$fragment-parent` to the root; debounce keys per
 *   (bag, root); the flush renders the ROOT — one carrier, one file. A
 *   fragment URI never owns a disk path (bag-paths returns null for them).
 *
 * Echo suppression ranks (Confluence): the CONTENT-HASH gates carry the law —
 * ingest drops disk-hash == synced-hash; projection skips byte-identical
 * writes. The `writing` Set survives beneath them as a latency
 * optimization only (skip re-statting our own in-flight writes); no
 * correctness rests on it.
