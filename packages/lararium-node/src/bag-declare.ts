/**
 * bag-declare — the node-fs shore for a bag's own declaration, the operator's repo registry, and the MOVE.
 *
 * The pure half (what a bag declares, where that resolves, what a move would change) lives in
 * `@lararium/mesh`'s bag-manifest + bag-home. This is the disk: read the `meta.mem` a bag carries, read the
 * repo registry the operator configured, and — under an explicit approval — relocate the bytes and rewrite
 * the declaration together.
 *
 * ── THE REGISTRY IS THE CURE FOR MAGIC STRINGS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every repo an operator uses gets an ID here, once, with its root. A bag then names the id and nothing else,
 * so no directory ever enters an artifact meant to travel. Registering is the operator's own act: the code
 * ships no repo, infers none from a checkout, and treats an unregistered id as a refusal rather than a hint.
 *
 * ── THE MOVE IS AN ACT, AND IT ADMITS IT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Relocating a bag moves an operator's bytes across a boundary that matters: into a tracked history, or out
 * of one. So it runs HITL (`--approve`), it PLANS before it touches anything (both ends resolve first), it
 * refuses to overwrite an occupied destination, and it moves the directory whole rather than merging into
 * whatever stands there. A move into a `repository` leaves the actual committing to the operator — this
 * writes files into a working tree and never runs a source-control verb, because deciding what enters a
 * history belongs to the hand that will answer for it.
