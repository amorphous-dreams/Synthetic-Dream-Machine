/**
 * nexus-refresh — the LIVE-refold shore behind the `nexus-refresh` daemon verb.
 *
 * A running node reads three authorities off the `bags/nexus` charter + the always-carried antigen / members
 * boards: the federation POSTURE, the Kapae'd DENY set, and the contracted MEMBER set. All three settle at boot
 * and re-fold live ONLY on a board-doc CHANGE that reaches the running repo — the WS-sync path (a peer's ban or
 * admit propagates over the relay, fires the handle change, refolds). But an OUT-OF-PROCESS edit does NOT reach
 * the running node: `lares nexus posture` rewrites a DISK file the boot read once, and `lares nexus kapae` /
 * `admit` write the boards through their OWN throwaway repo. NodeFS carries no cross-process change bus, so the
 * running repo's cached board handle never sees those bytes. This refresh closes that gap on demand.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES, once, fail-closed:
 *   1. POSTURE — re-read the disk charter fresh and hand the posture to the caller's setter (which reassigns the
 *      sharePolicy's live `federationPosture`). A torn / absent charter reads PRIVATE (`federationPostureFromDoc`
 *      fails closed), so a broken read can only ever tighten the mesh, never open it.
 *   2. BOARDS — re-materialize the antigen + members boards on a THROWAWAY repo bound to the same storage dir
 *      (a cold-cache read → the flushed on-disk bytes the CLI wrote), then hand each fresh board doc to the live
 *      holders' `refoldWithBoard`. The holders swap their sets whole; a fold fault leaves the prior set standing.
 *
 * NO-GLOBAL-NOW: the refresh reads THIS node's own storage as-of-now — never a global truth of who is banned or
 * admitted. It re-reads a local replica the operator's own CLI just wrote beside it; a peer's change still rides
 * the WS-sync refold, not this shore. TRACK-CONTRACTS-NEVER-IDENTITIES holds unchanged — the boards carry operator
 * pubkey nyms + quorum seals only, and this shore reads them, never a user.
