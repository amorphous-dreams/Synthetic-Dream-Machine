/**
 * runNexusContract / runNexusAcceptCarriage / runNexusMembersList — the RAISE side of the operator MEMBERS-registry
 * (the Kapae-antigen's ALLOW-twin). The founding kahu WRITE a quorum-signed `admit` / `revoke` onto the
 * always-carried members BOARD; the READER (`members-board`) + the consult (`nexus-membership`,
 * `carrierShareDecision`) fold it. This is the writer they were missing — the mirror of `runNexusKapae`.
 *
 * TWO WAX-SEALS ride an ADMIT (membership-doctrine):
 *   · the OPERATOR's own "accepts carriage" contract-sig (the contract-in). Either the joining operator produced
 *     it out-of-band (`lares nexus accept-carriage` → a token supplied via `contractSig`), OR — the a-multitude-
 *     of-one ceremony — the vessel HOLDS the admitted nym's persona seed and self-signs it. FAIL CLOSED: no valid
 *     contract-in → REFUSE. A Nexus cannot conscript an operator into carriage; the operator consents first.
 *   · ≥ threshold founding-kahu quorum signatures (the steward act — identical to the antigen's).
 * A REVOKE needs the kahu quorum ONLY (an uncooperative member cannot veto its own removal).
 *
 * TRACK CONTRACTS, NEVER IDENTITIES: the writer takes an operator PUBKEY nym + (for admit) a carriage contract-sig.
 * No name / email / device / behavior is read, asked, or written — the FLOOR alone lands on the board.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED, at every shore (mirrors nexus-kapae):
 *   · an unseated / quorum-short charter → REFUSE (nothing to root a quorum on); no board write.
 *   · fewer than `threshold` HELD persona-roots that sit IN the seated roster → REFUSE; no sub-quorum entry.
 *   · an admit with no valid contract-in → REFUSE; never write a conscripted member.
 *   · an entry that does not COUNT against the seated roster → REFUSE; never write a dead admit.
 *   · a malformed nym → REFUSE.
