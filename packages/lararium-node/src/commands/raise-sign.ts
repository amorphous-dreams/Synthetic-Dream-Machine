/**
 * raise-sign — the RECOGNISER's half of the raise ceremony, and the only half that runs off-vessel.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS HALF NEEDS NO DAEMON AT ALL ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The vessel being raised emits a challenge; a recognised operator signs it on THEIR OWN machine, with
 * THEIR OWN persona root, and hands the grant back. Nothing about that touches the asking vessel — which
 * is precisely the property the design wants: the caps that arrive ride the recogniser's key, and no key
 * of theirs ever rests on the vessel they raise.
 *
 * So this reads a challenge, signs it, and returns a grant. It holds no vessel state, opens no board, and
 * writes nothing anywhere.
 *
 * ── IT REFUSES A CHALLENGE IT CANNOT READ, RATHER THAN SIGNING A SHAPE ──────────────────────────
 * The challenge crosses from another machine as text, so it arrives untrusted. A signer that accepted a
 * partial shape would put a recogniser's signature on fields they never saw — and the signature is the
 * whole consent. Every field must be present and well-typed, or this refuses and signs nothing.
