/**
 * runCabalVouch — the JOIN axis's WRITE side: one voucher stakes their own standing on one joiner.
 *
 * THE CONTRAST WITH CARRIAGE, AND WHY IT NEEDS NO QUORUM. `nexus-contract` writes a CONTRACT and therefore
 * needs the kahu quorum plus the joiner's own consent — a Nexus cannot conscript a vessel into carrying, and
 * no single kahu may seat one alone. A vouch inverts that shape: ONE hand stakes ITS OWN standing,
 * attributable by construction, and it grants nothing by itself. So it takes no quorum and asks no steward.
 * The cost lands on the voucher automatically — their score SPLITS across everyone they vouch for, so the act
 * of vouching dilutes them, which carries the whole payment and needs no ledger to collect.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It admits nobody. A vouch rides as signal-2 on the lineage; the crossing itself runs through
 * `admitOnLineage`, which folds this board and prices the applicant. Minting a vouch for someone who never
 * crosses costs the voucher their dilution and buys them nothing — the intended asymmetry.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED: an unknown persona root, a malformed joiner nym, an expiry already past, or a signature that
 * does not read back off the board REFUSES before anything lands. Never write a vouch the fold would drop.
 *
