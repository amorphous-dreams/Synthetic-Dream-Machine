 * with filter- and crash-fallbacks) over the lararium's OWNED content palace. This is lift-as-consume
 * for recall: the search VALUE-ADD is their code behind the causal-island boundary, so upstream
 * search improvements flow back; the lares surface (`/mcp lares`, the CLI) just calls this.
 *
 * Palace-keyed (composePalace): one search holder per palace dir; the query text is embedded inside
 * search_io (their model), so it needs no lares-side embed for the query.
