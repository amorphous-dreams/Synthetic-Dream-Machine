/**
 * self-slot-share — the federatable-own vs private-own SPLIT the node sharePolicy enacts per WS peer.
 *
 * The DaemonAuthGate admits an inbound peer; the keyholder worker vouches HOW it relates to this
 * operator's identity (the PeerClass). This pure decision reads that class and routes the doc:
 *   · an IN-PROCESS island peer (no WS socket) — a house member — shares FREELY (empty relay ring).
 *   · a SAME-OPERATOR WS peer — it proved admin@daemon OR a pinned-root device-edge, both UNFORGEABLE —
 *     shares FREELY too (full device sync; the operator's own fleet carries every private plane).
 *   · a CROSS-OPERATOR or UNCLASSIFIED WS peer — a singleton relay ring + the self-slot federation gate.
 *     The CARRY-SPLIT (operator-ruled 2026-07-20) lets the mesh BREATHE across a Nexus here: a cross-operator
 *     the nexus-doc consult names a MEMBER blind-transits a PROVABLY-SEALED private plane (carry the ciphertext,
 *     never the read-cap); a STRANGER (valid identity, no contract) reaches ONLY the deterministically-
 *     federatable public shelf. The read-lane denial stays absolute — no cross-operator ever decrypts.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED: the class the worker could not positively vouch as same-operator arrives here `undefined`
 * and routes to the STRICTER cross-operator branch — the federatable floor crosses only if PROVABLY
 * federatable; the sealed-carry lane opens only for a PROVABLY-member peer over a PROVABLY-sealed plane
 * (absent the nexus-doc consult or the seal oracle, every cross-operator is treated STRANGER).
 *
 * THE SPLIT RIDES THE OUTER RING — the deterministic federatable set (DeterministicFederationGate) — and
 * that placement IS the safety: the outer gate is the position where a permissive substitution would leak a
 * private-own plane, because nothing runs ahead of it, so the split seats a CLOSED-SET membership test there.
 * A cross-operator peer therefore reaches a FIXED public/infra surface, never an over-broad grant of this
 * vessel's own docs. The INNER verifyCapability-for-self ring stays null here, and its absence costs no
 * safety: the composition ANDs outer-first, so an inner ring can only ever NARROW this verdict, never widen
 * it (measured: `lararium-mesh/tests/allow-all-ring-ordering.test.ts`). The #59 antigen consult runs AHEAD
 * (a Kapae'd presenter draws Mu even for a federatable plane).
