# Hand-off Crystal — Lares Lararium Node Branch

> Forged: 2026-05-07
> Last update: 2026-05-12 — Peer boot parity closed: Node primary/admin/worker TW5 VMs now boot from the same content-addressed `tiddlywikicore` LarariumDoc blob path intended for browser peers. `TW5CoreBootBlob` carries bytes + sha256 + source; `TW5Engine` verifies the digest before eval/injection, denies filesystem boot ingress, disables TW5 Node folder scans, and keeps tiddler ingress on preloads/adaptors. Quine gate green. Next open: Path K (F-arc debounce), Path L (admin ingress trust gate), Path G remaining sigils.
> Branch: `feature/lararium-node-3`
> Working tree: clean after peer-boot-parity commit.

## Bootstrap paste (drop in at next session start)

```text
Resume from packages/HANDOFF.md.
Branch: feature/lararium-node-3.
Current delta (2026-05-12): peer boot parity closed. Node primary/admin/hot-worker
TW5 VMs no longer boot from the installed `tiddlywiki` runtime as authority;
they receive the `tiddlywikicore` bytes from `LarariumDoc.blobs[ENGINE_CORE_ID]`
with sha256 provenance. `TW5Engine.boot()` now accepts `TW5CoreBootBlob`, verifies
the digest before evaluation/injection, denies `fs`, narrows host builtins, runs
Node blob boot in a neutral host profile (`node=null`, `browser=null`), disables
TW5's normal wiki-folder scan, and keeps tiddler ingress on `preloadTiddlers` +
`MemeSyncAdaptor`. Worker protocol remains version 1 for alpha. Verification:
`pnpm --filter @lararium/tw5 build`, `pnpm --filter @lararium/node typecheck`,
and `pnpm --filter @lararium/node exec tsx scripts/test-quine.ts` green.
S5.8 ✅ closed. S6 (BagResidencyManager) ✅ closed (C.1→C.6, C.5 deferred).
S7.1 (Capability layer via @keyhive/keyhive) ✅ closed (D.1→D.6).
S8 (Wiki composition) ✅ closed (E.1→E.10). Twelve operator verbs across
`lares bag` + `lares wiki` subcommand surfaces.
E.10.1→E.10.4: canon-promote hardening + ahu render rewrite via TW5
wikirule + cascade + templates. E.10.5→E.10.9: yin-mode collapse —
delete MemeticParser typed-widget emitter (~330 lines), purge dead web2-
era stubs (-18 files), drop tag-driven cascade discriminator (Roslyn /
recast / XInclude consensus), consolidate ahu scanner into one shared
@lararium/core/meme-ast/ahu-scan.ts module, replace `\rules except`
pragma injection with WikiParser subclass. E.10.10→E.10.11: tw5-typed
adopted as dev dep + activated in tsconfig types array; coexistence
with hand-rolled types (per-site migration as call sites are touched).
E.10.12 (Path V.1): Vite plugin config + build script ship dist-plugin/
lares-memetic-wikitext.tid — drag-and-drop installable in any TW5
5.4+ wiki, gives memetic-wikitext authoring + export without
lararium-node, Automerge, Keyhive, ReactionEngine.
E.10.13 (Path V.2 + namespace alignment): TW5Engine no longer mutates
the running VM imperatively. Boot pushes one envelope tiddler
(`lar:///plugins/lares/memetic-wikitext`) into preloadTiddlers; TW5's
standard plugin loader registers wikirule/parser/deserializer/widget
modules and materializes cascade configs + templates + mount as
shadow tiddlers. Namespace alignment: every Lares system title moved
to `lar:///` (cascades, mount, templates, plugin envelope). Tag VALUES
stay TW5-conventional. Dual-distribution build emits both
`lares-memetic-wikitext.lar.tid` (canonical) and
`lares-memetic-wikitext.tid` ($:/-titled, drag-and-drop).
E.10.14 (Path A): Wikirule split into three canonical TW5
module-type:wikirule files (lar-sigil-block, lar-sigil-inline,
lar-doctype-comment) + shared helpers. Parser exports as
`{ MemeticParser as "text/x-memetic-wikitext" }` per TW5 wiki.js
convention. Widgets self-`require`("$:/core/.../widget.js"), set
prototype chain, export under tag name. Plugin loader unpacks via
canonical `$tw.modules.applyMethods` flow. Smoke (in-process) green.
G.1→G.5 (Sigil family): aka URI sigil, pranala-header, kahea + loulou
URI sigils, pranala edge (inline + block forms with body-or-not branch
in template), then refactor: five sigil widgets (aka, kahea, loulou,
pranala-header, pranala) collapse into makeCascadeSigilWidget factory
(~165 lines replaces ~590 lines). ahu stays bespoke (slot/uri/parentUri
resolution doesn't fit factory). kau retired from G — its dispatch
logic (kumu-def lookup, capability hooks, UUID write-back) is logic-
heavy not template-driven; cascade pattern is wrong abstraction for it.
J.1 (meme-level framing): postamble symmetric with prologue. Pre-SOH
content captured as `prologue`, post-ETX as `postamble`. Trim duplicated
postamble from parent's text field (MemeStreamParser fullText extends
past ETX in single-meme files).
J.2a (slot-level framing): per-slot preamble/postamble + iam field
capture. Each slot is itself a "full published meme MD file" projection
(operator-confirmed). preamble holds prose flanking the iam toml block,
with `<<~ iam >>` sentinel marking iam's original position so prose can
exist on either side. postamble holds prose after the last inner kahea
ref. iam toml content extracted to native fields + raw bytes preserved
as `iam-source`.
J.2c (round-trip emission): pre-computed `preamble-rendered` field
substitutes the iam sentinel with the regenerated toml block. Meme-
template emits via `<$text>` widget (not `{{!!field}}` transclude) —
per Jermolene GH #6712, `\rules only` pragma scope doesn't propagate
through field transclude. Bytes survive verbatim through round-trip.
J.2b (default-elision): regenerateIamToml(fields, parentFields) walks
iam-class fields (denylisted against TW5 system + Lar control fields),
elides values matching parent's effective iam, emits remainder as toml.
splitRecursive threads parentIam through recursion so deep slots elide
against immediate parent's effective iam (= inherited + own merged).
Operator edits to native iam-class fields flow back to disk; inherited
values disappear from emission unless overridden.
ARCHITECTURE INVARIANT (operator-confirmed): always-split, always-kahea.
Deserializer + <$lar-meme-split> widget split every ahu sigil into its
own tiddler at sync/save time. Parent text always carries kahea-refs
for slot children. Disk emission canonical: parent file + N child files.
No tag discriminator. ONE parser, FOUR call sites — disk sync, CRDT
inbound, TW5 UX save (via lar-meme-split widget), disk export — all
consume splitRecursive identically.
Disk projection five-layer child meme structure verified end-to-end
(2026-05-10). Architecture hardening: disk projector now subscribes to
TW5 wiki change events only (MemeSyncAdaptor stamps `bag` field;
projector reads it without touching Automerge). `wikiShadowPathStrategy`
extended with bare `lar:///ha.ka.ba/{rest}` URI fallback. `deserializer.ts`
threads `parentSourceFile` → child `file-path`. `LARARIUM_MEME_TEMPLATE_MARKDOWN_MEME`
emits SOH+iam+STX+body+ETX+EOT for slot children. Plugin bundle rebuilt
(`tsx scripts/build-plugin-tiddler.ts`). Nine files verified in
`wikis/scratch/memes/docs/lares/the-lares-protocols/`.
Next paths: end-to-end daemon smoke with `lares serve` + CLI promote
ceremony (verify plugin/cascade/elision compose with bag/sync layer);
remaining G sigils (lele, papalohe, pae — operator-confirmed less
urgent than aka/kahea/loulou which carry the load); F-arc (TW5 vm
refresh-pipeline + debounce shim, important once browser peers come
online); S7.4 (admin doc ingress trust gate); dreamdeck-app sprint
(picks up S6.C.5); <$lar-promote> action-widget; federated promotion;
CodeMirror 6 + LSP alignment (Path W — operator-gated on CLI wiki
stability).
Architecture laws hold: causal-island, bag=Automerge-doc=sync-boundary,
canon-promotion requires active operator decision, TW5 VM primacy,
web3-only — no HTTP/RPC for inter-process coordination, command-tiddlers
through admin doc instead.
Sync semantics for cap log: γ-with-operator-α-mirror (Beelay-aligned).
Memory: feedback_architecture_principles.md + feedback_web3_only_lares.md +
project_lares_cli_and_command_protocol.md +
project_capability_layer_design.md (NEW S7.1).
Do not re-decide: @lares/cli is its own package; command-tiddler split
contract (cmd/=signal, log/=durable record); attach-only CLI mode;
@keyhive/keyhive pinned at 0.0.0-alpha.56c; bag↔Keyhive Document 1:1;
two-tier policy (Keyhive crypto + ABILITY_LADDER caveats); DID via raw
bytes-hex (not idString); ContactCard via JSON; corpus-vs-engine package
category boundary.
```

## Handoff Lares Prompt (paste into next lares-daemon)

```text
Resume from packages/HANDOFF.md and packages/SESSION.md first.
Branch: feature/lararium-node-3.

Assume the following already landed today:
- packages/lararium-core/src/live-protocol.ts created and exported.
- packages/lararium-core/src/kumu-device.ts promoted from maybe/ and exported.
- packages/lararium-node/src/lar-wiki-worker.ts now boots ReactionEngine in Worker promote path and forwards fired listenables to main as worker events.
- packages/lararium-node/src/open-node-lar-peer.ts now routes NodeVmManager onWorkerEvent into eventBus vm-ring.
- Typecheck clean (`npx tsc --noEmit` in lararium-core and lararium-node) and tests green in lararium-node (32 passing).

Next objective:
1) Implement real worker-side changeset application (Automerge local replica + changed URI derivation + TW5 update path).
2) Wire resulting changed URI set into ReactionEngine.onChangeset for true Scale-3 tick behavior.
3) Add/expand NodeVmManager integration tests for mountWiki -> routeChangeset -> unmountWiki (including teardown snapshot and event forwarding assertions).
4) Keep J.3 recursive promote gap visible but secondary to P.3.5 completion.

Operational rule:
- Continue in E-prime OODA-HA flowstate; only zoom out for operator input when a genuine architecture fork appears.
```

## What landed in this branch

| Sprint | Status | Punchline |
|---|---|---|
| S5.5 | ✅ | Causal correction — server finds, never seeds. Bootstrap plugin container. Content-equality guard. Revision-as-Date.now retired. |
| S5.7 | ✅ | Bag-aware `LarDiskProjector` (canon leak closed). Genesis walks all `packages/*/memes/`. `lares heleuma` audit/scaffold. `lares-chapel-perilous-opens` removed. |
| S5.6 | ✅ | Admin TW5 VM stood up. Admin doc at `lar:///ha.ka.ba/@lararium/@admin`. Bag-mirror configs read from admin tiddlers tagged `$:/tags/LarariumBagMirror`. |
| S5.8 | ✅ | `@lares/cli` package + `lares` binary; command-tiddler CRDT protocol; TS dispatcher; promote/where/echo handlers; durable audit-event tiddlers. |
| S6 | ✅ | `BagResidencyManager` end-to-end: pinned/hot/cold tiers, LRU + idle sweeper + sync-state guard, register-cold for oracle stubs, composite-store hydrate-on-read, `lares status` residency line. C.5 same-machine peer consolidation deferred to the dreamdeck-app sprint. |
| S7.1 (D.1→D.6) | ✅ | @keyhive/keyhive (concap) integration complete. Operator-key bridge, AdminEventStore persistence, ctx.cap wired, promote-handler enforces. Operator identity and admin proof survive daemon restarts. |
| S8 (E.1→E.10) | ✅ | Wiki composition end-to-end. `lares bag` + `lares wiki` subcommand surfaces (12 verbs). Per-wiki draft bagId namespace; explicit `BAG_IDS.projection` MemoryTiddlerStore. Disk → CRDT sync ceremony. DXOS-style bag epoch for bounded history. Nix-generations recipe rotation. Stale-tiddler queue. Hot-reload via composite addLayer/removeLayer. |
| S8 (E.10.1→E.10.4) | ✅ | Canon-promote ceremony hardened end-to-end. E.10.1: Keyhive registers all writable bags at boot (lar: URIs, not automerge: URLs); `lares draft <uri>` ceremony pulls non-writable-bag tiddlers into draft for promote. E.10.2: six bugs fixed — open canonical bags as writable+defaultWritable:false; MemeSyncAdaptor buffer gate skipped for local-origin events; AutomergeDocStore.tombstone carries `record.bag`; disk-projector per-bag unlink on tombstone; cross-bag tombstone walks `composite.getLive()` before yanking from TW5; promote/where source-detection via `listBagsHolding`. E.10.3: exportMemeText routes through `wiki.renderTiddler`. E.10.4: ahu render dispatch as TW5-native wikirule + cascade + templates — AhuWidget owns no scope decision, MemeticParser+deserializer registration synchronous (race fix), `wikirules/memetic-wikitext-sigil.ts` makes `<<~` first-class grammar in any wikitext context. |

## S5.8 sub-arc — what each commit landed

| # | sha | Punchline |
|---|---|---|
| B.1 | `47d72020` | `@lares/cli` package scaffold. `bin/lares.ts` dispatcher + parse-args. `lares init` ports old `init-lararium.ts` via new `runInit()`. |
| B.2 | `50a9c5be` | Full taxonomy port: `lares` covers status, serve, dev, reset, fresh, build-genesis, test-quine, heleuma. Old pnpm scripts removed (operator chose immediate replacement). Init path-bug fixed. |
| B.3 | `b564ef0c` | Command-tiddler protocol: title `lar:///ha.ka.ba/@lararium/@admin/cmd/<requestId>`, tag `$:/tags/LaresCommand`. TS `CommandDispatcher` + `CommandHandlerRegistry` mounted alongside admin VM. Echo handler for smoke. |
| B.4 | `1681e83f` | Promote handler (TS, factory closing over room composite). `tombstoneInBag()`, `hasWritableBag()` on CompositeStore. Durable audit-event tiddlers under `@admin/log/<requestId>`. Tagged `$:/tags/LaresCommandEvent`. |
| B.5 | `1ff23ede` | `lares promote` CLI: WS attach to daemon as Automerge-repo peer; recipe-presence preview via `where` handler; confirmation prompt; full polled round-trip + tombstone. |
| B.6 | _(this commit)_ | Full smoke proven (where round-trip via CLI). HANDOFF + memory updates. Serve-cwd bug fix folded in. |

## Architectural keystones to preserve

- **Bag = Automerge doc = sync boundary**. Each bag has its own URL, its own ingress trust gate (S7.4), independent federation surface.
- **Admin doc federates only to operator's own devices** via `cap=infrastructure` device delegations. Never reaches room peers.
- **Canon-promotion law**: wiki edits land in `wikis/{slug}/` (gitignored). Promotion ceremony moves a tiddler from wiki bag → canonical bag; disk side effect = file move from `wikis/{slug}/` → `packages/`. Git diff IS the operator's signature on canon.
- **TW5 VM primacy**: if it can happen in the VM, it MUST happen in the VM.
- **Web3-only inter-process coordination**: NO HTTP/RPC dispatch surface. CLI ↔ daemon ride command-tiddlers in the admin doc, transported by the existing Automerge-repo WebSocket sync.
- **Heleuma invariant**: every load-bearing source file (re-exported from `index.ts` or marked `@heleuma:required`) needs a self-describing meme at `lar:///ha.ka.ba/@{pkg-scope}/v{ver}/{slug}` whose `source-file` field anchors the off-bag artifact.

## Command-tiddler protocol — quick reference

- **Command URI:**  `lar:///ha.ka.ba/@lararium/@admin/cmd/<requestId>`  tag `$:/tags/LaresCommand`
- **Audit URI:**    `lar:///ha.ka.ba/@lararium/@admin/log/<requestId>`  tag `$:/tags/LaresCommandEvent`
- **Lifecycle:** CLI writes pending → dispatcher transitions running → done|error → CLI tombstones command-tiddler. Audit event survives.
- **Handlers today:** `echo` (admin composite), `promote` (room composite), `where` (room composite, recipe-presence).
- **Forward generalization:** when UEFN-Verse ReactionEngine lands, this dispatcher pattern federates across causal-island bounds; command-tiddlers become one shape of reaction trigger among many. Comments inline in command-dispatcher.ts and promote-handler.ts.

## Path P — NodeVmManager / TW5 VM pool lift

> Sprint opened 2026-05-11. Branch: `feature/lararium-node-3`.

### Research verdicts baked in

- **CRDT-snapshot boot**: valid optimization (Redis RDB+AOF / Agoric xsnap pattern).
  Store `{ heads: Automerge.Heads; tiddlers: TiddlerFields[]; capturedAt: number }` at cold
  eviction. On re-instantiation: `tw5.boot(coreBlob, snapshotTiddlers)` → attach adaptor →
  `Automerge.getChangesSince(liveDoc, heads)` replays only deltas. CRDT remains sole truth;
  snapshot is a disposable cache.
- **Parse/render split**: `deserializeCarrier` routes to any hot VM (grammar-pure). `renderMeme`
  routes to the owning wiki's VM (template-dependent). PrimaryWiki = operator-configured wiki
  (`--wiki` flag), not a hardcoded "Slot 0".
- **All VMs get lares plugin**: `LARES_MEMETIC_WIKITEXT_PLUGIN` already auto-pushes (tw5-vm.ts
  L107). `lararium-lares` corpus blob preloads explicitly for content VMs. Admin VM gap (P.4).
- **Per-slot event bus**: each VmPool slot owns its own `$tw.Wiki` instance + projection bus.
  `registerProjectionBus(engine)` teardown pattern per slot at unmount.

### `VmSnapshot` type (shared, lands in P.2)

```typescript
interface VmSnapshot {
  heads:       Automerge.Heads;   // CRDT marker — authoritative
  tiddlers:    TiddlerFields[];   // materialized TW5 view — cache only
  capturedAt:  number;            // unix ms
}
```

Atomic invariant: write heads + tiddlers together or not at all. Mismatch → full CRDT replay,
snapshot discarded.

### P.1 — Eliminate cold-boot-per-sync ✅ (2026-05-11)

**web2 smell**: `createSyncWikiHandler` cold-boots a fresh `TW5Engine` per CLI invocation.
Each `lares wiki sync` pays a full TW5 boot cost (plugin load + wiki init) even though the
daemon already holds a booted engine for the active wiki.

**Fix**: Add `getPrimaryEngine: () => TW5Engine` thunk to `WikiMintHandlerOptions`. Pass a
closure over the daemon's `tw5` instance. Sync handler uses it when wiki matches the primary;
falls back to cold-boot for unmounted wikis (marked `@web2-smell: cold-boot-per-op` for P.2
to clean up once multi-wiki mount lands).

Files: `packages/lararium-node/src/wiki-handlers.ts`,
       `packages/lararium-node/src/open-node-lar-peer.ts`

### P.2 — `NodeVmManager` three-tier pool (scaffolded 2026-05-11, hardening next)

Extract `VmPool` + boot logic into a `NodeVmManager` class. Three residency tiers:

| Tier    | Description | Count |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Pinned  | PrimaryWiki + admin — never evict | 2 |
| Hot     | LRU of recently active wikis, each with a live TW5Engine | max 4 |
| Cold    | CRDT-only — no TW5 engine; `VmSnapshot` persists materialized tiddler view |

API surface:
- `mountWiki(wikiId, composite, docHandle)` → boots TW5Engine with snapshot if available
- `unmountWiki(wikiId)` → captures `VmSnapshot`, tears down engine + projection bus
- `getEngine(wikiId)` → returns hot engine or thaws cold slot
- `parseMeme(text, uri)` → routes to any hot VM (grammar-pure path)
- `renderMeme(uri, wikiId?)` → routes to owning wiki VM (template path)

Slot 0 renamed from `VmPool.get(resolvedRecipeUri)` → `NodeVmManager.primaryWiki`.

Files: `packages/lararium-node/src/node-vm-manager.ts` (new),
       `packages/lararium-node/src/open-node-lar-peer.ts` (wire),
       `packages/lararium-core/src/vm-pool.ts` (VmSnapshot type export)

### P.3 — One Worker Thread per wiki, co-located TW5 + ReactionEngine (DECIDED 2026-05-11)

**Decision: NOT piscina.** Piscina is a load-balanced stateless task pool — wrong shape for
stateful per-wiki VMs that must hold warm TW5Engine + warm ReactionEngine and dispatch into
both synchronously within a single Verse tick. Piscina is still the right tool for
grammar-pure `deserializeCarrier` / `parseMeme` calls (stateless, any-hot-VM, P.3-narrow).

**Decided shape:**
- One dedicated `worker_threads.Worker` per **hot-tier** wiki slot
- Each Worker hosts TW5Engine + ReactionEngine **co-located** (same thread, synchronous reads)
- `MemeSyncAdaptor.onChangeset` fires first (updates TW5 state), then RE.onChangeset (fires
  reactions against the now-current TW5 state) — this ordering IS the tick boundary invariant
- Main thread ↔ Worker: StructuredClone messages for tiddler changes; Transferable for blobs
- Cold-tier slots: no Worker (CRDT-only + VmSnapshot); Worker starts on promotion to hot
- Pinned tier (PrimaryWiki + admin): may stay in-process until Worker isolation proves stable

**Why co-location is required:**
Verse's game-loop tick is synchronous within a turn. RE.onChangeset calls `fireSync()` which
immediately reads TW5 tiddler state to evaluate reaction conditions. Cross-thread reads would
require async IPC — breaking the synchronous-tick invariant. Co-location in one Worker gives
both engines shared V8 heap + deterministic firing order at zero IPC cost.

**kumu-device.ts sketch:** throwaway. The types (KumuListenable, KumuSubscribable,
KumuDeviceSpec, ReactionEngine) will be rewritten from scratch in Path R. The vocabulary
and invariants in the file comments are the load-bearing artifact; the TS is not.

**P.3-narrow (stateless parse pool):** piscina IS the right tool here. `deserializeCarrier`
and grammar-pure `parseMeme` route to any hot VM (confirmed in P.2 research). Wire a
separate `Piscina` instance just for that path — no per-wiki state needed.

Gate: P.2 NodeVmManager three-tier pool must reach test-suite stability before Worker
threads are added to the hot-tier slots.

### P.4 — Admin VM corpus plugin preload ✅ (2026-05-11)

`openAdminVm` boots TW5 without the `lararium-lares` corpus blob. Admin bag-mirror
configs (bag-id, mirror-root, strategy tiddlers) may reference lar: URIs that only
resolve with the corpus plugin loaded. Preload `lararium-lares` in the admin VM
at `open-admin-vm.ts` boot time — same pattern as the main peer.

Files: `packages/lararium-node/src/open-admin-vm.ts`

---

## Forward paths (post-E.10.13)

### Path V.2 ✅ (E.10.13) + Path A ✅ (E.10.14) — Plugin-tiddler boot path
TW5Engine boots by pushing one envelope tiddler into `preloadTiddlers`; TW5's standard plugin loader unpacks. Wikirules split into three canonical files; parser/widgets/deserializer use TW5-canonical export shapes (Path A). Namespace alignment: every Lares system title in `lar:///`. Dual-distribution emits both canonical and drag-and-drop envelopes from one Vite bundle. In-process smoke (`scripts/smoke-plugin-boot.ts`) verifies plugin loads, parsers/widgets register, ahu/aka/kahea/loulou/pranala-header/pranala render as widgets, slot bodies round-trip with default-elision.

### Sigil family ✅ (G.1→G.5 + J.1+J.2a/b/c)
Six sigils ride the template-cascade architecture. Five share `widgets/_cascade-sigil-base.ts::makeCascadeSigilWidget(config)` — declarative widget definition (cascadeTag + fallbackTemplate + buildBindings + setCurrentTiddler? + refreshUri? + placeholder?). ahu stays bespoke. Slot-as-full-meme-MD-projection invariant: each slot has preamble (with `<<~ iam >>` position sentinel), iam-source (raw bytes), preamble-rendered (with sentinel substituted via regenerated toml), text (body proper with kahea refs), postamble (trailing prose). regenerateIamToml default-elides against parent's effective iam (inherited + own merged through splitRecursive recursion).

### Smoke ✅ — End-to-end daemon round-trip (2026-05-10)
In-process smoke: deserialize + render + plugin boot — clean (27 shadow tiddlers, all 6 sigils render, slot round-trip verified).
Daemon smoke: `lares serve` + `lares wiki sync altar-fire` + `lares promote` ceremony — **verified at protocol layer**. Room bag (altar-fire) → canonical bag (@lares), audit tiddler written. infrastructure-correct = feature-correct confirmed at the happy-path layer.

**Gap revealed — J.3 child co-promotion missing:**
`lares promote` is single-URI. `splitRecursive` during `wiki sync` creates `#fragment` child tiddlers (one per ahu slot) in the room bag alongside the parent, but the promote handler only moves the parent URI. Children stay in the room bag; canonical disk projector writes only what's in its bag. Result: parent emitted correctly (with `<<~ kahea ahu #slot >>` kahea refs per always-split law) but child slot files never land in `packages/`. Naming this J.3.

**Key lessons:**
- `lares wiki sync <room>` is the prerequisite for promote — disk file must be ingested into room bag first.
- "Already lives here" = correct idempotency guard, not an error.
- Always-split invariant is working; the gap is in the ceremony, not the serializer.

Test artifact (`packages/lares/memes/docs/lares/the-lares-protocols.md`) deleted; server reset clean.

### Path G — Other sigils via wikirule + cascade + templates
Port the sigil set (`aka`, `kahea`, `kau`, `lele`, `papalohe`, `pranala`, `pae`) to the same architecture ahu now uses. Each sigil:
  - extends `wikirules/memetic-wikitext-sigil.ts` with its match patterns (block and/or inline modes per operator note);
  - ships its own template tiddlers under `lar:///ha.ka.ba/@lararium/templates/{sigil}/{html,markdown-meme}`;
  - registers its cascade entries `$:/config/Lar/{Sigil}Template/*`;
  - keeps any sigil-specific JS widget thin (cascade-resolve + transclude).
Open question per sigil: does it own a child tiddler (slot child) or fragment-render in place? `aka` projects, `kahea` invokes, `kau` places (with Keyhive UCAN attachment), `lele` flows, `pae` phases (LADDER/OODA-HA), `pranala` is an explicit edge. Each gets its template grammar.

### Path H — Save-side auto-split (TW5 UX → child tiddlers)
The fourth call site of `parseMemeText`. `MemeSyncAdaptor.saveTiddler`'s `direct` strategy detects memetic-wikitext content, runs `splitMemeToTiddlers(title, text, fields)`, writes parent + child records to the bag, tombstones removed children. Symmetric with the disk-sync path — operator edits a parent meme in TW5 UX, inserts a new `<<~ ahu #foo >>body<<~/ahu >>`, hits save, and `lar:///parent#foo` appears in the bag autonomously. Same-grammar invariant the operator named: edit on disk OR edit in UX, identical result.

### Path I — Wikifier DOCTYPE + dash + macrocall recovery
Three small diff items in current round-trip output: HTML comment DOCTYPE dropped; TW5's `dash` rule converts `|---|` → `|—|`; MemeticParser's prologue handling (DOCTYPE, root iam toml extraction) survives but the wikifier swallows the comment in text/plain. Fix by either disabling rules at the parent meme rendering level (via a meme-level wrapper template that pragma-disables them), or by emitting these via `<$text>` widgets carrying the literal char sequences. Aesthetic, not load-bearing — defer until G+H ship.

### Path J — Per-slot iam emission with default-elision + recursive promote ✅ CLOSED
J.1+J.2+J.3 all complete (2026-05-11). `promote-handler.ts` enumerates `#fragment` children by URI prefix, confirms each still lives in the source bag, and co-promotes in one atomic ChangeOrigin. Returns `childrenPromoted: string[]` in the ceremony result.

### Path K — F-arc deferred (TW5 routing rule + Yjs debounce + auto-truncate projection)
Original F-arc charter — `$:/state/*` → projection layer; `Draft of *` → per-wiki draft bag; Yjs-style captureTimeout debounce 300-500ms; idle auto-truncate of projection layer. Lives in MemeSyncAdaptor. Important once browser peer surfaces let operators edit at sustained rates.

### Path L — S7.4 Admin doc ingress trust gate
Already-deferred. With S7.1 closed, the admin doc's WebSocket federation can gate on `cap=infrastructure` proofs. Pre-condition for federating between operator's own devices.

### Path M — Dreamdeck-app sprint (picks up S6.C.5)
Browser-side peer scaffold. Builds atop Path L's cap-gated admin doc.

### Path N — `<$lar-promote>` action-widget
UI shim writing the same command-tiddler the CLI does.

### Path O — Heleuma stub authoring + federated promotion
50+ scaffolded memes carry TODO content; `lares heleuma --write` keeps the audit aligned. Federated promotion: any room VM, any peer, gated by Keyhive cap chains.

### Path W — CodeMirror 6 / Lezer alignment
Once V.2 ships, the wikirule patterns map cleanly onto CM6 + Lezer grammar. `tobibeer/codemirror-6-tw5` is the closest active community effort. Aligning gives operators rich-text editing of memetic-wikitext in the live UI (browser peers + TW5 standalone). Plugin tiddler grows a `module-type: editor` wrapping the Lezer parser; same drag-and-drop install. Operators in the broader TW5 community get visual editing without lararium dependencies. linonetwo's `Modern.TiddlyDev` Vite harness is the natural development surface.

## Smoke-test recipe (verify branch state)

```sh
# Fresh slate + boot
lares reset --force      # wipes .lararium + bootstrap, re-init
lares serve              # daemon foreground (alternate terminal)

# In another terminal — smoke negative path:
lares promote lar:///definitely-not-real --to lar:///ha.ka.ba/@lares --yes
# Expected: "tiddler not found in any bag: …"

# Verify cap-layer round-trip:
# Boot 1: clean .lararium → keyhive logs `did=0x…  admin-bag registered  self-admin=true`
#         Cap events accumulate as $:/tags/CapEvent tiddlers in admin doc.
# Boot 2 (kill + lares serve): keyhive logs `hydrated N cap events from admin doc`
#         followed by SAME did=0x… and self-admin=true. Identity persists.

# Verify S6 residency:
lares status               # includes "residency: N pinned · M/cap hot · K cold"
lares bag stats            # full residency snapshot (renamed from `lares residency` in E.1)
lares bag register-cold automerge:test  # marks URL as cold, no hydration

# Verify S8 wiki composition (E-arc):
lares wiki init MyWiki              # mint canonical + per-wiki draft + recipe
lares wiki sync MyWiki              # ingest rooms/MyWiki/memes/** → canonical
lares wiki list                     # enumerate all wikis with their automerge URLs
lares wiki which lar:///some/uri    # recipe-presence query
lares wiki pin MyWiki               # pin every bag in the recipe
lares wiki add-bag MyWiki <uri>     # compose recipe at runtime
lares wiki bag-epoch <bag-uri>      # snapshot-restart one bag (bounds history)
lares wiki rotate-recipe MyWiki     # Nix-generations: fresh canonical, old as underlay
lares wiki prune-stale MyWiki       # surface stale draft tiddlers (default 7 days)

# Smoke `lares status`:
lares status
# Expected:  bootstrap: present | storage: N files, X KiB | port 8080: in use

# Real promote (operator: pick a tiddler that lives in a room bag):
lares promote <uri> --to <target-bag>
# Walks: where preview → confirmation → promote → audit URI printed
```

## Known open items (small, non-blocking)

- `ReactionEngine` import in main.ts is stubbed (lives in `lararium-core/maybe/kumu-device.ts`; awaits unparking). The "reaction" projection kind not registered.
- `wikis/{slug}/` writeback writes hashes/IDs as filenames — not yet integrated with a file watcher inbound. Disk → CRDT direction not built yet (intentionally absent — only outbound writes for now).
- `heleuma` script could usefully detect drift in `uri-path` field too (currently only checks `file-path`).
- Command-tiddler tombstone happens client-side (CLI), so an ephemeral CLI crash leaves the cmd/ namespace dirty. Mitigation: dispatcher could auto-tombstone after audit-event write (decision deferred — operator may want command-tiddlers to remain visible as in-flight signals).
- `lares heleuma` flags 2 missing memes for `@lares/cli` source files (lares.ts, parse-args.ts) — lands in Path C.
- Some legacy daemon log noise: `TimeoutNegativeWarning` from Automerge repo on attach. Cosmetic.
- `meme-sync-adaptor.ts:129` — `targetBag` default string is `"room"` (stale from rooms→wikis rename). Cosmetic; production callers always pass an explicit bag ID.
- Heleuma drift: `ha.ka.ba/@lararium/tw5/widgets/toml` needs `tsx scripts/sync-heleuma.ts --sync-modules --commit` to resolve.
- `file-path` absent in child iam when tiddler is authored directly in TW5 UX (not synced from disk) — `source-file` field not set → `parentSourceFile` empty. Correct by design (no disk path exists yet); J.3 promote ceremony will set it once children land in canonical bag.

## Active memory pointers (claude memory system)

- `project_milestone_state.md` — keep current; update with S5.8 closure
- `project_lares_cli_and_command_protocol.md` — NEW, captures CLI conventions + protocol shape
- `project_async_causal_islands.md` — still load-bearing
- `feedback_architecture_principles.md` — never re-decide
- `feedback_web3_only_lares.md` — Kowloon stays external; never internalize web2 patterns
- `feedback_communication_rules.md` — e-prime + OODA-HA structure for prose

## Don't re-decide list

- `@lares/cli` is its own package (NOT part of `@lararium/node`)
- Command-tiddler URI shape: `cmd/<id>` for transient, `log/<id>` for durable audit
- Tag `$:/tags/LaresCommand` is vm-side metadata; lar: title is load-bearing
- Promote = TS handler; widget is a future UI shim that writes the same command-tiddler
- Attach-only CLI mode (daemon must run); ephemeral in-process boot deferred
- Recipe-presence preview before promote prompt is required UX
- ULID-style request id: millis-base32 + 8 random base32; sortable, monotonic
- Per-package `memes/` is the canonical convention — no central `ha-ka-ba/` filesystem aggregator
- **Corpus-vs-engine package category.** Corpus packages (`@lares/lares`, `elyncia`, `ftls`, `sdm`, `wtf`) hold tiddler-package projections in `memes/`; their root JS is at most a 5-line path helper, NOT a TS pipeline. Engine packages (`@lararium/*`, `@lares/cli`) run `src/` + `dist/` + `tsc`. The asymmetry encodes architecture-principle 5: meme files are render projections, code is code-as-projection. Do not migrate corpus index.js to TS.
- **Command-tiddler split contract.** `cmd/<id>` = thin signal-tiddler (status state-machine ONLY, no result/error data). `log/<id>` = durable record (full result+audit). Dispatcher tombstones `cmd/<id>` after writing `log/<id>`. CLI polls `log/<id>` and never tombstones. Crash-safe.
- **Capability layer = @keyhive/keyhive (Ink & Switch concap, pre-alpha).** Bag URL ↔ Keyhive Document, 1:1. Two-tier policy: Keyhive provides the binary read/admin cryptographic gate; ABILITY_LADDER caveats live at the application layer (promote-handler etc.). Pinned to `0.0.0-alpha.56c`; upgrades = planned breaking changes.
- **Cap-log sync semantics: γ-with-operator-mirror.** Room peers hold the cap-subgraph for bags they're members of (Beelay's transitive-closure-rooted-at-doc rule). Operator devices hold the full cap log across all bags as a strict subset of γ. NOT (β) full-graph (leaks topology). NOT pure (α) operator-private (breaks revocation propagation).
- **DID encoding.** Use `whoami: IndividualId` + own bytes-to-hex. NOT `idString` — strips per-byte leading zeros, breaks DID round-trip.
- **ContactCard transport.** JSON via `toJson`/`fromJson`, wrap with TextEncoder. NOT bytes — alpha.56c doesn't expose `toBytes` for ContactCard.
- **Cap-event home: D4.a — inside the bag's own Automerge doc** (TW5-native, decided post-research). Title shape `lar:///{bag-uri}/cap/{event-id}`, tag `$:/tags/CapEvent` (sub-tags `.../Prekey`, `.../Cgka`, `.../Delegation`, `.../Revocation`). Reasons: bags are TW5 policy boundaries, not performance boundaries; cap events MUST share the bag's sync surface (peer with bag but not cap log can't validate writes); Automerge has no cross-doc atomicity; TW5's own pattern co-locates high-churn runtime metadata (history, state, drafts) with content via `$:/` + tag, not via separate bag. Companion-doc shape is reserved for future *performance* tuning if cap-event volume crosses a threshold.
- **TW5 system-namespace boundary (E.10.13).** Every Lares system tiddler TITLE lives in `lar:///`: cascade configs (`lar:///config/Lar/...`), global mounts (`lar:///mounts/...`), templates (`lar:///ha.ka.ba/@lararium/templates/...`), plugin envelopes (`lar:///plugins/lares/...`). Tag VALUES stay TW5-conventional `$:/tags/...` — tag values are not titles, do not intersect the sync filter, and let cascade entries plug into TW5's standard tag-discovery path. Drafts, ephemeral UX state, and shadow-tiddler defaults stay browser-local in `$:/` by design. For drag-and-drop community distribution, `$:/plugins/...` envelopes MAY re-emit the same plugin module code; canonical signature lives in the `lar:///` form. Decision recorded in `packages/lares/memes/api/v0.1/pono/lar-uri.md` (TW5 System Boundary section).
- **Plugin-tiddler boot path (E.10.13).** TW5Engine boots by pushing one envelope tiddler — `lar:///plugins/lares/memetic-wikitext` — into `preloadTiddlers`. The standard `$tw.modules` flow registers wikirule, parser, deserializer, and widget modules; cascade configs, templates, and the `<$lar-meme-split>` global mount materialize as shadow tiddlers. No imperative widget/parser/wikirule registration code remains. Parsers instantiate via the canonical TW5 construction path (not a hand-rolled prototype-chain dance). Do not reintroduce imperative `parsers["text/x-memetic-wikitext"] = ...` mutations.
- Chapel-perilous-opens removed; unstable URIs resolve as virtual until promoted to a stable @-scope
- Admin URI shape: room URI vs bag URI distinction is intentional
- Bag-mirror configs live in admin room (operator-private, federates to operator devices only)
- `MemeStoreDoc` reused for AdminDoc — semantic distinction in URI, not type
- `wikis/{slug}/` gitignored — promotion ceremony writes git-visible canon

*The crystal holds.*
