/**
 * ffz-orchestrator — the FFZ node-side FLUID-BAND pipeline (the last live shore).
 *
 * Arc + Pulse stamp at CAPTURE (the in-VM annotate, live). The fluid bands — Measure
 * (topic-shift) and Theme (thread cluster) — have no embedder at the capture site, so
 * they re-derive NODE-SIDE, post-hoc, on the local ARC-CLOSE gong (consolidate-when-
 * input-stops, per the unified model — the fluid bands re-cluster on rest, never
 * continuously). THIS module is that pipeline:
 *
 *   1. READBACK — read a session's stored vectors back out of the palace, ordered by
 *      (source_file, chunk_index), via `loci_io.py embeddings` (the CONTENT plane,
 *      live). FORM/STRUCTURE planes (formpalace/structurepalace move/AST vectors keyed by
 *      verbatim_sha) are SCOPED — see the scope note below; absent them the quorum
 *      degrades gracefully to the one CONTENT plane (the N=1 {@link quorumStep} path).
 *   2. RUN — per session: the Measure servo over the ordered vectors → a segment LABEL
 *      per drawer ({@link quorumStep} always — content as plane-0, derived from the embeddings
 *      via {@link centroidDriftStep} when no multi-plane drift feed rides). Theme: the wing's
 *      drawer-graph clustered
 *      (networkx, in `loci_io.py cluster`) + the {@link ffzAcceptRecluster} MDL guard.
 *      Beat: the drawer's `chunk_index` (free, from the readback).
 *   3. STAMP-BACK — overlay the committed fluid-band cells onto each drawer's EXISTING
 *      `lar_ffz` (parse → overlay Measure/Beat/Theme → re-serialize), preserving the
 *      birth-stamped Arc/Pulse, and merge the `{lar_ffz}` patch back via `loci_io.py
 *      apply`. Deterministic + idempotent: a re-run derives the byte-identical address,
 *      so the merge is a no-op. The patch carries ONLY `lar_ffz` — ZERO causal/edge/itc
 *      key rides it (the PATH-B cut: `lar_ffz` is rhythm-only).
 *
 * SCOPE REPORT (form/structure plane availability):
 *   - CONTENT — LIVE. `loci_io.py embeddings` reads the stored nomic vectors (never
 *     re-embeds), ordered per session. Always plane-0.
 *   - FORM — LIVE. `loci_io.py form-embeddings` dumps the stored move-vectors flat,
 *     joined per session on verbatim_sha (plane-1 when a session joins it).
 *   - STRUCTURE — LIVE. `structurepalace_io.py structure-embeddings` dumps the stored AST-SHAPE
 *     vectors flat (the deterministic structural encoder — a node-type histogram + tree-shape
 *     stats, cosine-meaningful), expanded across each structure's provenance verbatim_shas
 *     (the last plane when a session joins it). The vectors POPULATE on the nuke-and-pave
 *     re-harvest (alongside content + form), so all THREE planes light at once.
 *   {@link orchestrateWing} runs at N = the planes a session joins (1 content-only · 2 +form ·
 *   3 +structure); {@link quorumStep} is plane-agnostic, so each plane drops straight in. The
 *   degradation stays graceful: an absent reader (or a session that joins nothing) drops the
 *   run back to the planes present, never breaking the N=1/N=2 paths.
 *
 * Lives BESIDE telemetry-writeback.ts (the other `lar_*` write shore): one boundary,
 * the dependency points node/cli → mempalace, never the reverse.
