"""content_blocks — the CONTENT→blocks adapter: page a ContentStore into (cid, text) blocks for the pave.

The content plane holds the ONE verbatim source; the pave reads it as a stream of `(cid, text)` blocks
and fans each into the derived recall surfaces. This adapter bridges content_io's ContentStore (its
`scan(offset, limit)` page API) and mempalace_pave.pave — it yields content's OWN cids, so the
projection inherits cid-parity by construction. The store rides in as an argument (never opened here),
so the adapter stays decoupled from content_io and witnesses against a fake store in isolation.
