"""Tests for form_induction — the S3 corpus FORM cap (blind grammar induction).

Proves the four movements corpus.md #the-form-induction names:
  1. TreeMiner surfaces frequent CLOSED embedded subtrees (no sub-pattern spam).
  2. PrefixSpan/BIDE surfaces frequent move-SEQUENCES over the streams.
  3. the MDL loop STOPS at the right grammar — a memorize-few template is rejected and the
     total description-length stops falling.
  4. seed-and-refine keeps a seed the corpus reproduces and DISCARDS one it does not.

Pure-miner tests need NO chroma; the batch `induce` graceful-skip test needs neither. Run:
