"""ffz_clock — the Fontany-Fuller-Zelenka rhythm clock, ported to py (behind the causal-island).

Two concerns ride here, both pure caps the pipeline composes later:

  1. THE LOGICAL CLOCK (ffz_zero/tick/compare/merge/serialize) — a bounded 5-level hierarchical
     stamp (L0 sub-action → L4 epoch). It PACES rhythmic position (WHERE in session/day/epoch),
     never total causal order; the CRDT edge-DAG carries causality. L4 grows unbounded so an epoch
     never aliases when lower levels roll. Ports packages/lararium-mesh/src/ffz-clock.ts.

  2. THE CLOCK RECOVERY (dominant_period / recover_clock) — A PERIOD ESTIMATOR, AND NOTHING MORE.
     It reads an EVENT-INDEXED signal and returns the stream's dominant autocorrelation period. It
     touches no wall-clock, and within those bounds it answers honestly.

     IT DOES NOT MAKE THE FFZ BANDS, AND MUST NOT BE READ AS DOING SO. A recovered fundamental with
     bands hung off it as nested subharmonics is a LADDER OF COUNTS — each band defined by HOW MANY
     ticks of the beat it spans. The grain forbids exactly that: a band names NESTED MEMBERSHIP, a
     containment PATH, never a count, and a band whose COUNT carries the signal cannot be truncated
     (the Hox anti-pattern — lop the prefix and the colinear meaning shatters). The bands stand as a
     TREE, and `ffz_address` builds it: Theme.Arc.Measure.Beat.Segment, where a band answers WHICH
     and never HOW MANY. Distance there reads as how far up two moments climb before they share a
     band — order-free, ultrametric, no timeline crossed.
       The canon retired the coupled-oscillator reading in 2026-06 ("Entrainment DROPS. The bands do
     not couple"), and this estimator is what remains of it: a period, honestly measured, with no
     ladder hanging beneath.

     AND A PERIOD IS NOT A BOUNDARY. A bandpass reports where ENERGY AT ITS SCALE concentrates; a
     change-point reports where the GENERATING REGIME turns over. Measured: the pour recovered the
     Kumulipo's wā PERIOD (C7, beat ~10,240 ticks against a measured ~9.4k wā gap, killed by
     meaning-death) and placed its BOUNDARIES at crest-recall 0.06. That gap names a CATEGORY ERROR,
     never a tuning failure — a periodicity instrument was asked a change-point question. Boundaries
     ride a cosine-drop / novelty read (a change-point instrument, which is what the grain specified all
     along); this returns a period, and a period is what a caller may take from it.

CLOCK-PURITY (two-clocks law): the recovery path touches NO host wall-time (no time.time()). Event
ordinal indexes the signal; the recovered beat rides in event-ordinal units. A static corpus carries
no temporal transitions, so it recovers NO beat — the clock reads holdover/provisional, never asserts
a rhythm fabricated from read-order (the Reference-Fusion-in-time trap the null-witness guards).
