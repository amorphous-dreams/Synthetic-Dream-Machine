"""dream_pass — deep-dream v0: the consolidation pass that READS an eidetic sensorium's
three planes and WRITES a consolidated Dream sensorium beside it.

THE TWO-STORE LAW (CLS, ruled): the eidetic sensorium holds the append-only immutable
ground — this pass READS it and NEVER writes it (the ward below proves that per run);
the Dream sensorium holds the mutable schema — a re-dream REPLACES its own prior content
whole (the mutability carries the design, not a defect).

SERIALIZE THE DERIVATION, NEVER THE CARRIER: every Dream record REFERENCES eidetic cids
and carries derived schema only — no content bytes, no eidetic embeddings ride along.
Each Dream record lands with a LOCATOR vector (a content-address-derived constant-width
fingerprint of the record's own cid) so the mutable ContentStore composes cleanly; the
locator addresses, it never carries semantics — recall over the Dream store rides
get/scan + the lar_dream_* metadata, not nearest-neighbor similarity.

THE LAYOUT (chosen, documented): the Dream sensorium stands as a SIBLING directory
`<eidetic-root>-dream` beside the eidetic root — never inside it — so the whole eidetic
tree stays untouched at the directory grain and the two stores read as two sensoria:

    <root>/            — the eidetic ground (content · structure · form), READ only
    <root>-dream/
      content/            — the mutable Dream ContentStore (append_only OFF)
      dream-manifest.json — the sensorium marker: kind=dream · mutable · provenance

THE PASS, two consolidations over one read of the planes:
  · SCHEMA — form induction re-runs over the eidetic structure forest at a dream-grade
    budget (above capture's per-pass bound, still bounded); the induced constructicon
    lands as first-class template records plus one membership record per eidetic cid.
  · COHERENCE — the plane restrictions stand by the projector idiom (each plane's own
    store and native pseudometric), then the H0 radius + the H1 gate write ONE coherence
    record: where H1=0 the kernel-consensus salience lands as the consolidated reading;
    where H1>0 the disagreement lands HELD OPEN (loci capped), never averaged — the
    honest Dream of an incoherent corpus records the incoherence.

PROVENANCE + CLOCK PURITY: every Dream record carries the eidetic root and an `as_of`
marker DERIVED from the eidetic content store (a fingerprint over its cids) — no
wall-clock touches the record path; host-time stays a sighting register the underlying
stores keep for themselves.

THE NEVER-WRITES-EIDETIC WARD, two instruments (a probe witnessed the split): a bare
chroma OPEN re-writes bookkeeping bytes inside chroma.sqlite3 with zero record writes,
so the sqlite carrier cannot hold a byte-identity witness. The ward therefore checks
  (a) the LOGICAL hash — every record (ids · documents · metadatas · vectors) across all
      three eidetic plane stores, canonically serialized, before vs after; and
  (b) the BYTE hash — every eidetic plane PAYLOAD file (the hnsw index binaries hold
      byte-identical), the sqlite carrier and the dot-prefixed one-time open markers
      set aside, before vs after;
and the pass FAILS LOUD on either drift.

RE-DREAM DETERMINISM (ranking sites cured downstream; one residual named): the MDL's
RANKING tie-breaks now hold a total order in form_induction (the closed-sequence sort
and the MDL candidate pool), so equal candidates rank by content, never arrival. A
RESIDUAL site remains in the subtree miner's BOUNDED enumeration: the walk iterates
set-seeded dict order, so the per-pass budget truncates a process-varying candidate
SET (witnessed post-cure over the 12-record bed: 46/49/79 surfaced subtrees, 3-vs-5
kept templates across fresh processes) — a differing set, which no ranking order can
re-align. Until that walk holds a total order too, cross-process re-dreams over
identical ground may keep equivalent MDL grammars that differ at the margin; within
one process the grammar re-settles identically, the replacement law holds regardless,
and the as_of provenance never varies (it keys to the ground).

THE DAYDREAM SHORE (named, out of scope): daydream carries the READ-cheap concurrent
reflection — it reads the Dream store's read face (get/scan + dream-manifest.json)
alongside the eidetic planes and writes nothing; deep-dream (this pass) stays the one
WRITE-expensive re-pass. A future daydream verb rides these same stores through their
read faces only.
