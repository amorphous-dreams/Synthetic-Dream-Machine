"""Real-chroma round-trip for the PersistencePalace store (persistence_io). Opens a real
ChromaDB collection in a tmp palace dir (the venv has chroma), exercising the DUMB store's
put/get/witness-RMW/neighbors — the lifecycle LAW stays in the TS keel, so this only proves
persistence + load + append + the neighbor read.
