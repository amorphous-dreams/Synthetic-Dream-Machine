"""worldline_io — the WORLDLINE RHIZOME (a fork-DAG over turns) + FULL kapae.

The agent worldline READS as a rhizome: a turn SPAWNS a fork, a HANDBACK joins the fork back,
and concurrent siblings of one spawn (no join between them) run ∥. This holder persists that
fork-DAG durably and drives the FULL kapae — branch-mute that CASCADES across the sensoria's
palaces so recall EXCLUDES a muted fork-path, reversibly, move-not-delete.

TWO append-only sqlite tables BESIDE the palace (the raw-sqlite-beside-chroma idiom kg_io /
structurepalace already ride):

  worldline_edges  — the rhizome STRUCTURE + the bitemporal spawn-interval.
      Each edge points CAUSE -> EFFECT (happened-before): a `fork` runs parent->child, a
      `linear` runs prev->next, a `join` (handback) runs child->parent (the reunion — the
      parent's post-handback acts stand AFTER the child). `valid_from` opens the interval on a
      caller LOGICAL tick; `valid_to` closes it at handback (bitemporal, kg_io's idiom).
      History stays: a close sets `valid_to`, never a DELETE.

  worldline_kapae  — the MUTE polarity-log (persistence_io's move-not-delete idiom).
      kapae APPENDS a `polarity=1` row per branch turn-key; un_kapae APPENDS `polarity=-1`.
      Nothing ever drops — a turn's live mute-state reads the LATEST polarity row (max id).
      This log IS the "polarity/valid-close edge" a defeat rides; a removal never happens.

CLOCK-PURITY (the sighting ward, no-global-now): every mark — `valid_from`, `valid_to`, the
kapae `tick` — takes a caller-supplied LOGICAL tick. This module imports NO host clock (no
time/datetime); a wall-time mark would corrupt the bitemporal stream with an unreliable
witness (persistence_io.witness carries the same tick idiom).

kapae is WORLDLINE-scoped — a branch (a fork-path subtree) plus its palace entries — DISTINCT
from the general release/supersede/purge. The cascade rides `cascade_kapae` below: it mutes the
branch in the rhizome, then mutes THOSE entries (by turn-key) across the pinned sensoria's
content stores. Un-kapae RESTORES across all of them.

Protocol — NDJSON over stdin/stdout, one JSON object per line (only JSON to stdout):

    -> {"id":1,"op":"ping"}
    <- {"id":1,"ok":true,"result":{"ready":true}}

    -> {"id":2,"op":"add_edge","parent":P,"child":C,"relation":"fork","tick":N}
    -> {"id":2,"op":"handback","parent":P,"child":C,"tick":N}      # join + close the fork interval
    -> {"id":3,"op":"dag","as_of":N?}                              # the rhizome (bitemporal read)
    -> {"id":4,"op":"descendants","node":X,"as_of":N?}            # the branch subtree (fork+linear)
    -> {"id":5,"op":"are_concurrent","a":X,"b":Y}                 # ∥ verdict (spawn-tree incomparable)
    -> {"id":6,"op":"kapae","branch":R,"tick":N}                  # mute the branch (returns turn-keys)
    -> {"id":7,"op":"un_kapae","branch":R,"tick":N}              # restore the branch
    -> {"id":8,"op":"muted_turns"}                                # the live-muted turn-keys

The CASCADE (branch-mute across the sensoria) rides the Python coordinator (`cascade_kapae` /
`cascade_un_kapae`) — it holds the rhizome AND the content stores, above any single palace.
