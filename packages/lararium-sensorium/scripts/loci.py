"""loci — the memory-palace SPATIAL-SCHEMA shore. OUR sensorium code speaks locus/imago (the ars-memoriae
lineage: a locus HOLDS, an imago is HELD); the nakama mempalace's drawer-store stands as the FIRST
concrete schema behind it. A block, once PLACED in a palace, becomes an imago resting at a locus (a wing
holds rooms holds the leaf-locus). The content plane keeps the literal CID'd blocks (the ki-matter); a
locus-schema arranges the imagines that reference them (the placed, spatial view).

WHY WRAP. The nakama keeps its drawer ontology inside its own submodule — we never rename it, we consume
it directly for one palace inside each sensorium. Naming OUR side of the boundary in loci/imago gives a
shore: a later spatial schema (a different arrangement — a grid, a graph, a timeline) slots in behind the
same vocabulary without touching the consumers. Today one schema stands: the nakama drawer-mempalace.

Behave-close law: the concrete schema delegates STRAIGHT to the nakama's own palace API (get_collection),
so the sensorium's mempalace behaves close to the upstream mempalace's code/flows — the wrapper adds a
vocabulary and a shore, never a divergent store.
