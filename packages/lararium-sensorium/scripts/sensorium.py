"""sensorium — a NAMELESS ENTITY composed from a #has cap-stack {source · land · embed · [worldline]}.

A Sensorium DERIVES its identity FROM its composed cap-stack; `kind` names its role for the operator/
@daemon. Content policy rides the land capability: append-only eidetic ground, mutable reflection, or
another declared stream policy. Other streams/corpuses attach the same way; the TS @daemon supervises
the fleet (spawns/points/drains, carries no payload). The pipeline
(capture) + the recall read-face ride the built caps (capture_stream.Pipeline + content_io); the worldline
cap (the fork-DAG + kapae) wires in when a rooted composition declares it.

Blind-by-composition (has-stack-ontology): compose REFUSES a missing required cap — a sensorium without
a source/land/embed cannot exist, rather than erroring later. Meme: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/sensorium/compose.
