"""loci_io — the substrate side of the @admin memory-shore.

The causal-island boundary made crossable, in ONE direction's I/O only:
this helper READS verbatim drawer content out of the mempalace library and
WRITES our domain-metadata patches back onto those same drawers. The sovereign
parse (the gradient harvester) stays in TS (@lararium/mesh) — this script never
classifies, never decides; it only moves bytes across the boundary.

Tensegrity: the verbatim drawer is the compression member (untouched content);
our `lar_*` metadata is the tension written onto it.

Our side of the boundary speaks the loci/imago spatial schema (`loci.open_loci`): a placed drawer is an
imago at a locus. The nakama keeps its drawer ontology inside its submodule — this shore wraps it, names
our side, and delegates straight to the nakama palace API, so the store and flows stay the upstream's.

  export --wing W [--limit N]   -> NDJSON {id, content} on stdout, only drawers
                                    not yet at the current harvest version (idempotent)
  apply  PATCHFILE               <- NDJSON {id, patch} ; merges patch onto each
                                    drawer's existing metadata (chroma update is
                                    merge-only — we never delete a field)

Run with the mempalace CLI's interpreter (it has the package + chroma):
