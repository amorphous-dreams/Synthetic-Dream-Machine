"""lares_mcp — the /mcp surface mirroring the `lares` CLI (ISOMORPHIC verb parity: CLI commands <-> MCP
tools, one verb-ontology across two surfaces). A fresh py FastMCP server routing to the lares house's own
py sensorium backend (capture_session · content_io · worldline_io). The coordinator-seat ruling: the MCP
verb-surface lives py; the TS @daemon supervises the fleet + keeps the surface-wiring. The vendored
mempalace mcp_server.py stays for the upstream nakama on their causal island — this serves the lares house.

The isomorphism lives in `LaresCoordinator` (the verb-router both surfaces call); the CLI commands and the
MCP tools stay thin skins over it, each verb named the same on both — pour · recall · status · worldline
· kapae · un_kapae (Phase-6a lifecycle floor; the extensions declare/attach/reconcile/release/daydream/
deep-dream + the HITL/HOTL grid ride in at 6b).

        Read modes + filters shed onto this spine: `imago` fetches ONE verbatim entry by turn-key; `list`

        `speaker`/`channel`/`function` narrow by the block's own axis — so a recall can surface the operator's
        steering as its own stratum (speaker="operator"), the loud voices (channel="speech"), or one role.
        A FILTERED recall now KEEPS combined-arms: the `where` rides INTO every surface — the content-vector
        filters natively (chroma), the mempalace projection rides a content-backed `cid_filter` — so the
