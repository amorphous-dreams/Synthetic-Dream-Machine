"""plane_fanout — the STRUCTURE + FORM plane caps that ride the capture pass (RUN-ARC #1).

The capture Pipeline lands the CONTENT plane; these caps fan the SAME records out to the
other two planes, so all three planes key on one cid over genuinely-shared units:

  · structure — `structure_router.parse_to_tree` unfolds each record's text into a
    content-free node-type tree; `structurepalace_io.StructurePalaceStore` lands it by
    structural hash with a provenance line binding back to the record's cid.
  · form      — `form_induction.induce_forest` mines the pass's OWN structure forest
    into a constructicon (MDL-selected templates, blind); each record then reads as a
    membership vector over those induced templates, landed by cid into the
    `form_encoder.FormPalaceStore` "form" collection.

THE INDEPENDENCE LAW (RUN-ARC — the whole point): neither plane ever touches the content
EMBEDDING. Structure reads only the parse SHAPE; form reads only the induced-grammar
membership of the node-type stream. Structure and form share the one parse-tree per record
by design (form_induction reads over the accumulated structure plane — corpus.md
#the-form-induction); the forbidden shortcut is surrogating either from the content vector.

IDEMPOTENCE: each cap owns its own durable-skip (the Pipeline re-offers every record on a
re-pass): structure skips a hash whose provenance already carries the record's cid (a bare
re-put would re-bump the recurrence count); form skips a cid the form collection already
holds. So a second pass lands zero on every plane, and a crash between plane lands cures
on the next pass — the same re-derivation discipline the content leg rides.

CLOCK PURITY: nothing here reads the host clock; the stores' own sighting registers carry
the only host-time marks (provenance, never ordering).
