"""lares_uds — the PY side of the @daemon cap-wire: speak a verb to the lares daemon over its
Unix-domain socket.

WHY A WIRE AND NOT A STORE HANDLE. The palace serve-holders (`content_io serve`, `search_io serve`,
…) speak NDJSON over raw **stdin** — so only the process that SPAWNED a holder can reach it, and a
per-palace flock makes a second holder exit rather than pile up. A py process that opens a store
directly therefore cannot share the vessel's holder; it opens its OWN chroma client beside it, and N
harness sessions become N unsynchronized clients on one index. No lock cures that; only ONE OWNER does.

So the shape holds: the @daemon owns exactly one set of py holders, and every other process — this one
included — reaches memory THROUGH it, over this socket. All the COMPUTE stays py (the holders embed,
search, and store); the TS @daemon only ROUTES. Routing a verb counts as coordination, never compute:
`@daemon coordinates, py computes`.

THE WIRE (mirrors the TS `invokeLocal`): connect the RENDEZVOUS (see `socket_path`), write ONE JSON line
`{verb, args, requestedBy[, requestId]}`, read ONE outcome line back. 0600 owner-only perms gate
presence; the `requestedBy` did rides the invocation for the daemon's verify-then-delegate.

ON THE WAIT. Entrance-block canon forbids a stream WAITING on the coordinator to advance its own
rhythm — a handler that blocks on the centre has made the centre its clock. That law governs
RHYTHM-BEARING streams (a capture body recovering a beat from its own data), not reads. A recall
recovers no beat and carries no phase, so blocking on the owner costs it nothing it has. Capture must
never come through here; reads may.

    A RENDEZVOUS IS NOT A RESIDENCE. The data homes answer whose it is; a socket answers where two
    processes MEET, under a limit the other question never heard of — `sockaddr_un.sun_path` caps near
    104 bytes. Sited beside the data, the meeting place inherited the substrate's depth, and a root a
    few directories deeper than expected took it down while every other part of the vessel stood.

    So the name derives from the root instead: the uid keeps two operators apart, the digest keeps two
    roots apart, and the path holds a fixed 40 bytes however deep the root runs. Deriving rather than
    sharing one short directory matters — two throwaway roots on a common socket would let a rehearsal
    reach the real machine's daemon while believing itself isolated.

    THIS SIDE DERIVES; IT DOES NOT IMPORT. No module crosses the language seam, so agreement is the
    only thing joining these two spellings — and `tools/rendezvous-parity-witness.sh` is what holds
    them to it. Move one and fix the other in the same breath."""
