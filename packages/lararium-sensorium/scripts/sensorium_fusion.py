"""sensorium_fusion — the py twin of the mesh H1 cohomological gate (RUN-ARC.md #3).

Ports the CONTRACT of packages/lararium-mesh/src/sensorium-fusion.ts — the gate that
tells apart the two categorically different no-global-nows over a li-assignment:

  H1 = 0 — the EPISTEMIC no-global-now: nothing forbids a global section; the planes
           reconcile toward the H0 consensus (a global section stands reachable).
  H1 > 0 — the ONTOLOGICAL no-global-now: a genuine cocycle — the planes agree on every
           pairwise overlap yet NO global section exists (the hollow-triangle
           obstruction). Nothing averages it away; the gate SURFACES it, carrying the
           reconciliation cost R*_sem = log2(dim H1) (Thomas-Chen).

WHERE THE SUBTLETY LIVES (the TS oracle's honest note, carried whole): the obstruction
rides the simplicial cohomology of the AGREEMENT NERVE — an edge where two planes overlap
AND agree, a triangle where three planes share a common WITNESS unit — NOT the value-
sheaf's cellular H1 (free restrictions make that one vanish identically).

  dim H1 = dim ker(d1) - rank(d0) = (E - rank d1) - rank d0     (rank-nullity; im d0
  sits inside ker d1 because d1 . d0 = 0), computed here through numpy's SVD rank.

THE FUSE, honestly scoped: the H1=0 branch returns the EXACT H0 consensus — the kernel
projection P_ker (the per-unit mean over the planes observing that unit), the target the
TS Chebyshev heat diffusion e^{-tL0} converges to as t grows. The order-K Chebyshev
POLYNOMIAL itself (an approximation dial + telemetry around that same target) stays a
TS-side instrument; the py RUN reads the exact target. Named here so the parity fixture
binds the CONSENSUS, never a truncation artifact.

Cosheaf (ki) planes are REFUSED, exactly as the TS gate refuses them.

The `fixture` face regenerates the committed TS<->py parity fixture:
