"""capture_sources — the multi-surface SOURCE-CAP family that LIGHTS the capture engine.

The engine (capture_stream.Pipeline) drives a source-cap: `callable(pointer) -> iterable of records
{seq, cid, text, metadata}`. This module supplies ONE cap per surface — **Claude Code · Codex ·
Copilot** each reading its native transcript into the engine's record grain, plus the **curated
human-text corpus** cap (markdown/text trees — the test-bed ground). The engine's crash-safe
re-derivation makes BULK and LIVE the SAME cap over one pointer: a re-pass re-reads the whole (growing)
source, is_landed skips the already-durable prefix, only the fresh tail lands. Main and sub-agent
sessions ride the same cap (a sub-agent transcript reads through the same parser, marked by surface).

THE BLOCK GRAIN. A source reads as a stream of typed BLOCKS, not merged exchanges: each content-block
lands 1:1, carrying WHO authored the bytes (`lar_speaker`) × its communicative ROLE (`lar_function`) ×
the REGISTER it sounds in (`lar_channel`). The
operator's steering, the agent's surface/thinking/action, and the harness's result/scaffold each ride
as their own block — so content keeps the operator/agent boundary the eidetic ground demands, and recall
pairs blocks into exchanges as a derived VIEW. The three native encodings normalize into this one grain:
Claude's DAG-linked JSONL and Codex's flat response_items already atomize per message; Copilot's SQLite
`turns` row splits its user_message ⊥ assistant_response columns into two blocks.

THE SINGLE CID GATE. ONE derivation mints every block id: `cid = sha256(source_file)_<chunk_index>`, FULL
sha256 hex, matching `caller-vector-flush.ts`'s `drawerCid`. The `chunk_index` (the per-source block
ordinal) makes distinct same-source blocks derive DISTINCT cids — so none clobbers another under a shared
key. Two identity keys ride METADATA, never the cid (the address stays pure content-identity): the
`lar_turn_key` (the heading operator block, worldline binding + kapae cascade) and the `lar_block_key`
(this block's own identity, the dedup key across a re-carry). Idempotent by construction: the same
(source_file, chunk) re-derives the same cid.
