"""rejim_io — the RHYTHM/geology DERIVED plane: repour a stream's nameless rejim over the WHOLE captured
content and land them, rebuildable like the mempalace projection. content = blocks (eidetic, per-block ground)
⊥ rejim = derived regimes (re-poured over the whole, holds no verbatim). NOT a declared sheaf plane — a
rebuildable view at `<root>/rejim`, wiped-and-repoured, exactly as the mempalace projection is re-paved.

Why REPOUR, not per-block: the geology is a whole-stream property (a dyadic scale needs the accumulated
stream to resolve; recurrence reads across the corpus). Pouring block-by-block would re-impose the block
grain the continuous pour exists to drop. So rejim re-derives from the content ground on a cadence, the
derived-view discipline — the caller drives it on the SERIALIZED capture pipe + a coalesce-gate so it never
blocks capture/recall and self-paces under pressure. The one-holder serialization IS the mutual exclusion
here (a single-writer palace via the singleton flock), not an explicit root-mutation lease; wired at the
serve-op + the idle beat (capture_session).
