"""capture_session — the COORDINATOR/DRIVER that takes the capture engine LIVE (the keystone wire).

The engine (capture_stream.Pipeline via sensorium.compose_stream_sensorium) stood DARK: no surface cap
parsed a transcript, nothing drove a pass. This driver composes the whole cap-stack and pulls the
trigger:

    Memory sensorium  =  content_io ContentStore (immutable ground, append-only, wing/room schema floor
                          + embedder-identity floor {dim, model})
                       +  a surface source-cap (capture_sources: claude · codex · copilot SQLite · copilot-vscode)
                       +  the warm embed cap (embed_cap: minilm/384, loaded once)

The DRIVER STAMPS the embedder identity: it reads `(embed_one, model)` off the warm cap, PROBES the
vector dim once, stamps `lar_embedder_model` onto every record's metadata, and pins `expected_dim` /
`expected_model` on the store — so a model/dim swap fails LOUD at the land, never corrupts recall
silently. Then it runs ONE capture pass (idempotent re-derivation: a re-run lands only the fresh tail).

Ephemeral-first witness discipline: point `--sensorium` at a tmp dir; NEVER seed the sovereign ~/.mempalace.

Usage:
  PYTHONPATH=<repo>/mempalace  <venv>/python capture_session.py \
      <claude|codex|copilot|copilot-vscode> <pointer> --sensorium <dir> --wing <wing> [--room <room>]

  · claude   pointer = a session `.jsonl` (or a sub-agent `agent-<id>.jsonl`)
  · codex    pointer = a rollout `.jsonl`
  · copilot  pointer = the SQLite `session-store.db` (NOT the deleted events.jsonl)
  · copilot-vscode pointer = the native Copilot Chat event-stream `.jsonl`
