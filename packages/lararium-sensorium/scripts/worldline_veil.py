"""worldline_veil — the VEILED worldline-root derivation (an identity-root that never leaks).

QA Pass-A C1b: `worldline_observe` rooted each braid at the BARE session basename (`run_id_of`), so the
worldline graph carried a stable, cross-referenceable session handle in the clear. Should the worldline
data exfiltrate, that bare handle rides out with it. This module VEILS the root:

    root = "wl-" + HMAC(local-secret, DOMAIN ‖ run ‖ context)[:N]

keyed by a LOCAL SECRET the owner holds in `<state>/identity/` — a dedicated worldline-salt
(env) or, failing that, the persona-group-root SIGNING key (the private persona-side half). NEVER the
vessel public key, NEVER a did (canon `persona-circle#the-block`: the vessel key MUST NEVER co-surface;
a did would re-expose the DreamNet identity the veil hides).

What the veil buys:
  · OPAQUE handles     — an exfiltrator reads only `wl-<hash>`; the run never rides out in the clear.
  · OWNER-RECOMPUTABLE — the owner re-derives the SAME root from the on-disk secret + the run, so a
                         drawer (carrying `source_file` = `<run>.jsonl`) still binds to its worldline.
  · DOMAIN-SEPARATED   — the DOMAIN tag walls this HMAC use off from any other use of the same key, so
                         reusing the persona signing key as a MAC key leaks nothing about the signer.

Root-shape B (per-worldline): each run mints its OWN veiled root; the handle keeps the `<root>.<agentId>`
shape (`worldline_observe.derive_handle`), now prefixed by the VEILED root rather than the bare run.

Clock-pure: this module imports no host clock (mirrors the sighting ward on the worldline edge path).
