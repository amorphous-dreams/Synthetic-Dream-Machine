"""Pytest config for the sensorium scripts — the SHARED-GROUND FENCE, plus the slow-test gate.

THE GROUND EVERY TEST IN THIS TREE STANDS ON. These suites drive real holders: each one opens a
chroma PersistentClient, resolves an XDG path, and reads a HOME-rooted corpus. None of that is
per-test unless something makes it per-test, and the three leaks below all measured live:

  1. HANDLES NEVER CLOSED. `mempalace.palace.get_collection` caches ONE PersistentClient per palace
     dir on a long-lived backend singleton and never closes it. Measured over `test_content_io.py`
     alone: open fds 31 -> 312 across 28 tests (~10 per test), while `test_loci_io.py` — same run,
     no chroma — held flat at 312. Over a whole-suite run the curve ran 12 -> 1245 and a set of
     wall-clock-deadline guards (`serve_loop` idle-reap, 0.5s TTL under a 5s assert) lost their
     margin and reddened, each one green when its file ran alone.

  2. THE REAL HOME. `session_discovery` resolves `~/.claude/projects`, `~/.codex/sessions` and the
     copilot store AT IMPORT TIME, so no later monkeypatch can move them: a test that reaches the
     sweep path mines the operator's actual chat corpus (1912 + 146 sessions, 1.6 GB on the box this
     was written on) into a tmp palace, which reads as a hang. `meta_io` likewise reads the
     operator's real `~/.config/lares/meta.json` — plant one and two `test_meta_io` tests red on
     content they never wrote.

  3. ENV THAT OUTLIVES ITS TEST. A bare `os.environ[...] = ...` (or product code that stamps an env
     var and never restores it) leaks into every later test in the process. This exact shape is a
     live defect in the vendored mempalace: `service.run_mine` stamps `MEMPALACE_PALACE_PATH`,
     `MempalaceConfig.palace_path` reads that env var AHEAD of the file config, and a later suite
     resolves a palace that a previous test's teardown already deleted.

The sibling conftest at `mempalace/tests/conftest.py` fences (1) and (2) for the vendored suite.
That suite sits outside this repo's `testpaths`, so the fenced conftest guarded a suite the
canonical `pytest` never runs while the suite it DOES run stood open. This file closes that gap.

WHY A READER AND NOT A LIST. The env half FAILS LOUD naming any key a test left changed, rather
than enumerating the keys we happen to know about. An enumeration cannot notice the key it missed —
which is precisely how `MEMPALACE_PALACE_PATH` walked past a hand-written eight-global reset list.
