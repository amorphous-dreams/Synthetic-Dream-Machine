"""aliran — DETECT the nameless flows in a stream, BEFORE naming them.

An `aliran` (Indonesian/Malay: a flow, a current — and a school, a lineage) is a nameless entity the
continuous pour DISCOVERS: a real characteristic scale/rhythm the stream's own structure holds,
distinguishable from noise and from an alias of the reading grain. Detection stands on the CONTENT
channel alone (no memetic-wikitext sigils), so the capability travels from the sigil-bearing test beds
(chat · pidgin · liturgical — one grammar-family) to sigil-less target corpuses. Naming rides LATER
(naming-by-condensation); an aliran stays nameless until then, carrying only its capability record — the
same way a content block is a nameless cid-keyed entity until a Voice reads it.

THE CROSS-SCALE COUPLING (the two-witness realness test, after cyclostratigraphy's TimeOpt): a real flow
shows an `aliran cepat` (a fast flow) whose amplitude envelope is MODULATED BY an `aliran lambat` (a slow
flow it nests in) — a nesting noise cannot counterfeit. On the sigil-bearing beds the lambat may ride the
sigil-frame cadence (red steers black); on a sigil-less corpus it is a content-internal slow flow. v0
reads the STRUCTURAL nesting; the amplitude-modulation witness rides v1.
