"""test_worldline_concurrency — the guards must hold under N CONCURRENT PROCESSES.

The `serve` path takes a per-palace flock singleton, so through the holder there is one writer and
the guards are trivially safe. But `capture_session.py` constructs `WorldlineStore` DIRECTLY,
in-process — so N live harness sessions put N OS processes on one `worldline.sqlite3`. Under default
sqlite settings `add_edge`'s cycle- and fork-guards are check-then-act: both writers pass a guard the
other is about to invalidate, both INSERT, and the lineage is malformed. It does not corrupt the file
— it produces a graph that READS as valid and is not.

These tests spawn REAL processes (never threads — the GIL would mask exactly the interleaving we are
hunting) and assert the invariants the guards exist to defend:

  FORK-CONFLICT: a child holds AT MOST ONE open fork-parent. N parents race to fork ONE child; the
                 store must admit exactly one and refuse the rest with `fork_conflict`.
  CYCLE:         the spawn-tree stays acyclic. Two processes race the two halves of a 2-cycle
                 (A->B and B->A); at most one may land.
