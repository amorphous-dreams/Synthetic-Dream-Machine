"""form_induction — the FORM cap: the corpus's OWN grammar, induced BLIND.

corpus.md #the-form-induction. The COARSEST of the corpus planes (Content ↠ Structure
↠ FORM — the chain of coarsenings; bands dissolved into the stored address). Where
`form_encoder.py` scores a turn against a KNOWN constructicon
(the fuzzy-membership plane, P2 of living-grammar-palace), THIS holder LEARNS the
constructicon a corpus never told us it had — the nameless learner: miners surface the
shape, description-length keeps only what pays, and the LLM names LAST (never inside the
loop).

An OFFLINE BATCH over the accumulated STRUCTURE plane (the structurepalace of content-free
trees the structure router filed under <corpus>/structure), NOT a per-turn hot-path move. One
`induce` command reads the forest back, mines it, and writes the corpus's constructicon
keyed by structural hash.

THE STACK (corpus.md #the-form-induction)
=========================================
  TreeMiner      — frequent EMBEDDED ordered CLOSED subtrees (the template surfacer;
                   Zaki's rightmost-extension enumeration, ported ~native so no dep;
                   CLOSED-filtered so a sub-pattern of an equally-frequent super-pattern
                   never spams the output).
  MaximalRepeats — every recurring CONTIGUOUS run of the pre-order node-type streams,
                   surfaced linearly over the FULL streams (maximal_repeats.py: suffix
                   array + LCP intervals; the pool bounds by the string, never a knob).
  ΔP association — usage-based construction candidates by the c2xg association measure
                   (candidate → identify(ΔP) → evaluate(MDL)). c2xg-the-PACKAGE targets
                   raw NL words + a gensim word2vec basis; our units are content-free
                   node-type / sigil labels, so we port its ΔP METHOD natively over OUR
                   streams rather than import a word-oriented stack (the on-target learner
                   applied to the corpus's own units).

THE STOP IS MDL. Every surfaced candidate — subtree, sequence, ΔP bigram, or SEED —
faces ONE description-length ledger over the streams: a template joins the constructicon
only if the bits it saves in l(D|G) exceed the bits it costs in l(G). The greedy EM-style
rounds add the best-paying candidate each pass and STOP when no candidate lowers the total
description length (l(G)+l(D|G) stops falling). A min-support floor + a held-out presence
cross-check guard the overfit corner — a template that only MEMORIZES a few instances
raises the sum and is rejected.

SEED-AND-REFINE is SAFE BECAUSE of MDL. We seed the candidate pool with a few KNOWN house
forms (the chiasmus open/close, the ahu-block, the sigil-row); MDL discards any seed that
fails to earn its bits, so the corpus can overrule the seed. Pure cold induction stays
available (seed=[]).

THE LLM STAYS OUT of the induction loop. `induce` surfaces + selects the templates BLIND;
labelling / merging is a documented DOWNSTREAM step (`label_constructicon`, a namer the
caller supplies AFTER mining) — that ordering is what honors the nameless discipline.

Protocol — a BATCH CLI (mirrors structure_router / bands, not a serve holder):
  induce --structure <structureDir> [--out <path>] [--min-support N] [--max-forms N]
      -> NDJSON: one {form} line per surfaced template, then a final {summary} line on
         stdout. --out mirrors the template lines to a file (the corpus's constructicon).

Run under the mempalace venv (PYTHONPATH=<repo>/mempalace so `induce`'s chroma readback
`import mempalace` resolves; the pure miners need neither):
  PYTHONPATH=<repo>/mempalace ~/.venv/bin/python3 form_induction.py \
      induce --structure <lararium>/sensoriums/c-x/structure
