"""ffz_continuous_pour — the continuous pour: true-stream FFZ wave decoupling over a corpus.

THE QUESTION. Every imposed segmentation (the line, the record, the chunk) manufactures the
finding it then reports (MAUP). This probe drops all of them: it pours the corpus end-to-end
as ONE continuous character stream, decouples the stream into dyadic detail bands (MODWT),
reads the FFZ lock PER BAND, and asks the data where its own scales live. Known grains (line
breaks, wā/record joins, work joins) ride ONLY as held-out annotations for the witness read —
they never enter the signal loop.

THE TICK: the CHARACTER TRANSITION. The finest honest grain the text carries — a word tick
presupposes a tokenizer (an imposed segmentation), while a character arrives the way a
real-time media sample arrives: one frame after another, no lookbehind past the previous
frame's tail. Each tick t reads only (char[t-1], char[t]).

THE SIGNALS (three; each names a distinct bearer of rhythm):
  · class-transition — 1.0 where the character CLASS changes (letter | digit | whitespace |
    punct | other; the apostrophe/okina folds into letter, the newline folds into WHITESPACE,
    so this channel stays LINE-BLIND). Word texture, clause texture, and — if line lengths
    carry a real rhythm — line texture must EMERGE here, never get marked.
  · sigil-event — 1.0 at each memetic-wikitext envelope mark (a `<<~` open or `>>` close).
    The ENVELOPE channel: it fires on a wrapped bed and lies flat on an extracted one, so the
    controls quarantine it by construction.
  · recurrence — the CONTENT channel: 1.0 where the 12-gram ending at t has already poured
    within the last 65536 ticks (a bounded recency memory — streaming-honest). Refrains and
    genealogy list-frames pulse it; a Markov-babble placebo destroys long repeats, so a scale
    alive here and dead in the placebo reads CONTENT-BORNE. The shape channel alone cannot
    split shape from meaning.

WHY NO STRUCTURAL-MARK CHANNEL. A channel that pours the text's own punctuation and newlines
(one unit-height train per mark class) reads its OWN typography back out. Measured: the mark
channels' peaks MOVE between beds of the same chant — on the Hawaiian (63k ticks) the newline
train peaked at scale 4 and the sentence train at scale 32, while the clause train peaked
nowhere; on the Beckwith English (396k ticks) the newline and sentence trains peaked nowhere
and the clause train peaked at scale 65536. A real band HOLDS under a change of grain; an
ALIAS MOVES. All of them moved, so the pour carries none of them. The wā beat reached us
through the RECURRENCE channel, never through a mark train.

THE ZONING LADDER (the decoupling, and the gate, in ONE operation). A pour at ONE grain cannot
tell a band from an alias of its own grain. So the pour runs the SAME stream at a ladder of
block-mean decimations D ∈ ZONING_LADDER (D = 1 pours at char grain; D > 1 pours the local
event RATE over a length-D block, the natural coarse observable for an event train). Each
zoning emits dyadic detail bands at scale_ticks = D·2^j. A band NAMES ITS SCALE, never its
level, so the same scale is addressable across every zoning that can resolve it:

    THE GATE — a scale earns REPRODUCED only by peaking under EVERY zoning eligible to
    resolve it. A scale that peaks under some zonings and not others MOVED with the grain: it
    reads as an artifact of the zoning, and the pour REFUSES it — no boundaries, no spans, no
    entities. The refusal is the finding.

One operation, three defences: the anti-alias check, the MAUP sensitivity analysis, and the
well-formedness check.

ELIGIBILITY (an admissibility window, never a detection threshold — it decides what a band may
be ASKED, never what the answer is): a zoning D resolves scale S only with ≥ SAMPLES_PER_CYCLE
stage samples inside one cycle (S/D ≥ 4) and ≥ CYCLES_PER_POUR cycles inside the pour
(n/S ≥ 4). A scale with fewer than MIN_ELIGIBLE_ZONINGS eligible rungs stands UNTESTABLE: the
ladder's own floor sits at scale 4 (only D = 1 resolves it), so the finest bands cannot be
re-zoned at all, and the gate says so instead of certifying them.

THE SURROGATE'S LIMIT, SAID PLAINLY. The per-band block-shuffle null answers exactly one
question — does this band hold more energy than a stream with its arrangement destroyed? It
CANNOT catch a deterministic alias: an alias is perfectly reproducible, so it survives every
noise-null, and it survives the surrogate BY CONSTRUCTION (the surrogate re-pours through the
same filters at the same grain, so the grain's own artifact rides both the observation and the
null). The surrogate therefore certifies ENERGY-ABOVE-NULL and nothing else. Alias duty sits
with the zoning gate, which changes the grain the surrogate holds fixed.

THE PER-BAND LOCK. Any bandpass detail RINGS at its own scale — even white noise autocorrelates
inside a band — and the surrogate's band rings and locks too, saturating both readings in the
fine bands. So the lock reads as a REPORTED rhythm gauge (each band's beat + locked-fraction
beside its surrogate's), never a peak tooth. recover_clock and SchmittLock run UNMODIFIED at
shipped thresholds; each band stride-decimates to its own scale first (the band's passband sits
below the decimated Nyquist, so no aliasing) — an adaptation at the signal, never at the guards.

THE EMERGENCE READ: for each REPRODUCED scale, boundaries = the crest events of its reference
band (local maxima above the band RMS, read at the finest eligible zoning), and the spans
between consecutive boundaries land as candidate SCALE-ENTITIES — nameless open records
({"span", "has": {…caps…}}), each with its scale, extent, energy, and recurrence links (cosine
over raw char-class histograms). No record carries a pre-label.

CLOCK PURITY + STREAMING: the tick ordinal indexes everything; no wall-clock touches any path;
every random draw seeds explicitly. The tick loop consumes FRAMES in sequence (an iterator with
per-stream seq — the StreamAdapter shape real-time media will speak); the carried state spans
one character, a 12-char gram tail, and the recurrence channel's bounded recency table. THE
BATCH SHORE, surfaced honestly: MODWT-MRA here runs as a batch over the collected signal. An
à-trous MODWT admits a causal streaming form with a per-level lag of (filter_len − 1)·2^(j−1)
ticks; the media era needs that port — named here, not built.

    ELIGIBLE to resolve that scale whether the scale still stands there.

    THE HOLD TEST, and why it reads ORDINALLY rather than by re-firing the tooth. A rung's
    peak FLAG carries the inherited energy threshold and a 3σ dispersion tooth whose spread
    widens as a rung's stage sample count falls, so the flag flickers at coarse rungs on a
    scale whose excess plainly holds — demanding the flag at every rung would manufacture
    REFUSALS the way a tuned threshold manufactures findings. So the hold test asks the two
    questions that carry no tunable number:

      · does the scale stand ABOVE ITS OWN NULL at this grain (excess ≥ 1 — the null's own
        unit, not a chosen level)?
      · does this rung ELEVATE that scale over its dyadic neighbours (a local max of the
        rung's excess ladder — an ordering, not a threshold)?

    A band locked to the ZONING GRAIN (the classic alias: the artifact sits at the rung's own

    rungs the artifact has moved to a different SCALE. That is the whole discrimination.

      UNTESTABLE — too few eligible rungs to re-zone at all (the ladder floor, scale 4, admits
