"""desync — the INTER-clock incommensurability tool: phase-offsets that keep N worldline-clocks
mutually NON-RESONANT, so no two rhythms lock into a manufactured global-now.

Leads with the PLASTIC number ρ (the Roberts low-discrepancy constant, DIMENSION-CORRECT for d=2 —
NOT copied φ, which is the d=1 case). Corpus-grounded (ffz-mesh-timing: the operator dissolved
"φ vs e"; a shared timing constant would BE a shared clock). The pair CHECKS the invariant (mutual
non-resonance); each node HOLDS the tool (its own low-discrepancy phase, chosen coordination-free from
its index). A HELD FORK stands beside this — φ+e-jitter (per-node 1-D) · coprime-integer (13/17) ·
Kuramoto frequency-dispersion — the others compose the same interface; plastic-ρ leads.
