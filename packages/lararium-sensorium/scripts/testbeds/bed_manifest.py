"""bed_manifest — Infrastructure-as-Myth for the Sensorium Palace's test beds.

A bed pours from a DECLARED manifest, never from a script's habit. The
manifest carries the whole pour as data — the (flow, focus, watermark)
discipline applied at ingestion:

  flow        — source roots + exclusions (every exclusion COUNTED at pour,
                never silent) + the record-unit rule per file kind
  worldline   — which orderings run REAL (in-file · containment ·
                git-history · turn-sequence) and which arbitrary; a null
                twin may scramble ONLY a real ordering
  twins       — derived FROM the worldline: the scramble grain names a real
                ordering, the twin sits SIZE-MATCHED BY CONSTRUCTION (the
                trial's size confound dies in this schema, not in vigilance)
  apertures   — the readings landing at pour, each tagged given | induced
  predictions — a pointer into EMERGENCE-PREREG.md; a bed REFUSES to pour
                while its predictions entry stands absent (the sheet's own
                law, made structural)

The pour itself rides the standing corpus_testbed machinery — this module
resolves and validates; it never re-rolls the planes.

Usage (the mempalace venv):
  PYTHONPATH=<repo>/mempalace ~/.venv/bin/python3 bed_manifest.py validate --manifest <bed.json>
  PYTHONPATH=<repo>/mempalace ~/.venv/bin/python3 bed_manifest.py pour     --manifest <bed.json> [--twin]
