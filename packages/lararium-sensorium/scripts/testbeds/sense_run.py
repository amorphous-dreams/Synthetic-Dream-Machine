"""sense_run — the isomorphic WORD-GRAINED wā harness. Runs sense_analyze's arms on a bed's own word stream
and scores them against a word-coordinate answer key, reusing boundary_score's pre-registered MATH — the
one-to-one match and the chance floor — UNCHANGED. One instrument, any bed, word positions end to end.

WHAT IT REPLACES. The per-bed *_boundary detectors (kumulipo/tw5/pidgin_boundary) each carried the same arm
math and re-aimed the scorer by REBINDING `boundary_score.ground_truth` at their own bed (last-write-wins, a
fragile shared global). sense_analyze now holds the arms once, adapted to the stream; this harness carries
the answer key to it, so the per-bed detectors + their rebind retire.

THE COORDINATE MOVE, and nothing else. The scorer's math never moved — only the grain did, from the scribe's
LINE to the content's WORD, the grain sense_analyze reads (MAUP-free, like FFZ). A boundary at line L maps to
the word index at L's start, in the SAME tokenization the instrument reads, so the key lands in the
instrument's own coordinates. The tolerance ladder carries the SAME physical span: `tol_words = tol_lines *
words-per-line`, so "within X lines" reads as "within X lines' worth of words" — no fresh prior.

THE WALL HOLDS. `bed_text()` stays the instrument's only door; the word mapping crosses on the SCORER's side.
