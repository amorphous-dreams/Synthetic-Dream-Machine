"""channel_dial — the RED/BLACK channel dial (lambda) over a wrapped bed's planes.

THE QUESTION THE DIAL ANSWERS. The memetic-wikitext wrapping carries two channels: the
RED channel (the `<<~ … >>` and `<<^ … >>` sigil layers — the classifier register that steers) and the
BLACK channel (the prose stream that speaks). The dual-run ablation showed the red
channel PICKS the parser and thereby replaces the structure plane wholesale (3 classes
vs 51) and manufactures form recurrence (3 sigil templates vs 1). The house designed
that fractal-repeating envelope deliberately — so the sensorium wants a DIAL to attend
past the envelope, never a cure that strips it. `lambda` in [0,1] weights the red
channel's contribution to the STRUCTURE and FORM planes:

    lambda = 1   — today's envelope-dominant reading (the wrapped bed as it stands);
    lambda = 0   — the black-channel-only reading (approximates extraction WITHOUT
                   extracting — the wrapping stays on disk, the lens attends past it);
    interior     — a convex mixture of the two channel readings.

THE MECHANISM (dual-derivation + metric mixture — the mechanically honest one):
  · the RED view reads the bed's OWN DURABLE PLANES (the stored parse trees keyed by
    provenance, the stored induced-template memberships) — so lambda=1 reproduces the
    projector's standing assignment BY CONSTRUCTION, never by re-derivation luck;
  · the BLACK view derives fresh per record: strip every sharktooth token (the same
    token grammar the sigil parser reads — the channels complement exactly), demote the
    kind (a carrier the sniff promoted to memetic-wikitext reads as its base grammar
    once the sigils fall silent — markdown here), parse, and re-mine the black forest
    with the plane-fanout defaults;
  · the dial mixes each plane's NATIVE PSEUDOMETRIC convexly —
        d_lambda(a, b) = lambda * d_red(a, b) + (1 - lambda) * d_black(a, b)
    (structure: DECKARD angular-cosine over characteristic vectors; form: Jaccard over
    membership sets; a convex mixture of pseudometrics stays a pseudometric) — then the
    plane's own salience law runs unchanged: hub-centrality over the mixed similarity,
    fractional rank into [0,1]. The mixture rides the metric; the rank step keeps the
    dial honestly nonlinear where centrality orders cross.

WHAT DOES NOT BLEND (surfaced, not fudged): a parse tree admits no interior point, so
STRUCTURE CLASSES at interior lambda count the JOIN partition — distinct (red-hash,
black-hash) pairs — and FORM TEMPLATES report both channels' counts side by side. The
CONTENT plane never takes the dial (the charge scopes it to structure + form); its
salience rides the stored embeddings, lambda-invariant.

THE SPECTRUM IS THE OBSERVABLE, THE DIAL SETTING IS NOT. The mixture rides inside a mean,
so each record's mixed centrality runs EXACTLY AFFINE in lambda and its rank changes ONLY
where two lines cross. `rank_agreement.crossing_spectrum` enumerates those lam* in closed
form; the sweep's ladder falls out of them (one rung per constant-order interval, plus the
endpoints) — CORPUS-DERIVED, hand-set by nobody. A ladder of hand-picked rungs sees only
the intervals it happens to land in and reports the boundaries it happens to straddle.

THE ARMS CARRY UNEQUAL GRANULARITY. A 3-class wrapped structure arm read against a
51-class one ties most of its pairs in BOTH arms, and a midrank correlation scores a
double tie as agreement. Every rank read here routes through `rank_agreement.agreement`,
which reports Kendall tau-c, both Somers' D directions, Fagin's K^(p) partial-ranking
distance, and the PAIR CENSUS — the double-tie count rides beside every scalar.

DETERMINISM + CLOCK PURITY: no RNG rides any dial path; the black forest mines in the
projector's own stable record order (source_file, cid); no wall-clock anywhere; the
comparator ward holds (~/.mempalace refused).
