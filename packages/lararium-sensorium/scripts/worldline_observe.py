"""worldline_observe — the DEMUX step 1b: read a captured transcript, build its worldline fork-DAG.

capture_session lands turns FLAT into content_io; nothing yet stands the braid the demux climbs. This
observer reads the transcript PROVENANCE and feeds worldline_io the edges that reconstruct the rhizome:

  · the MAIN linear chain — each turn links to its `parentUuid` predecessor, so `worldline_of` climbs
    the main session up to its root. A turn whose `parentUuid` reads null roots at the RUN node (the
    session id) — the braid-anchor.
  · the SPAWN fork      — a session's `<session>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl` names a spirit's whole
    worldline. Each spirit forks `run -> <run>.<agentId>` (the handle deriveHandle mints); the spirit's
    own turns chain UNDER that handle, so a spirit turn climbs handle -> run -> the session root.
  · the HANDBACK close  — the twin-reunion joins `<run>.<agentId> -> run` and closes the fork interval.

PORTED from worldline-observe.ts (`deriveSubagentEdges` / `observeSubagentWorldlines`): the law holds —
SPAWN keys to the spirit's first turn, HANDBACK closes at its last turn. TWO ports diverge by design:

  1. NODE SPACE. The TS observer emits prov:Delegation triples for the KG (handle-space, valid_from =
     ISO ts). This port lives in worldline_io's TURN-KEY space so `worldline_of` / `roots` / kapae read
     the SAME keys content_io lands under (lar_turn_key). The fork still runs `run -> handle` (the task's
     edge); the spirit's own turns then chain under the handle so the demux reaches them.
  2. CLOCK. The TS observer stamps valid_from = first ts, ended = last ts. This port rides worldline_io's
     tick discipline: a caller LOGICAL ORDINAL, monotonic in transcript read-order. NO host wall-time
     touches the edge path (clock-purity, the sighting ward) — this module imports no clock, and the
     transcript's own timestamps never reach an edge.

INJECT (prov:Communication) stays UNBUILT — the one-handoff / run-to-completion subagent model carries
no reliable mid-flight injection signal (see the TS note). The hook (`_derive_injections`) stands ready;
it returns nothing until a SendMessage-continue lifecycle lands a distinguishable signal.

The worldline stays LOCAL — a py-local worldline_io fork-DAG, never a federated/meshed doc.
