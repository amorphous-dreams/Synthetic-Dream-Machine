"""worldline_ffz — the PER-WORLDLINE FFZ leg: membership stamps + per-braid rhythm testimony.

The demux (worldline_io) partitions the captured turns into braids; this leg walks each braid and
serves the MEMBERSHIP-TREE address model (`ffz_address` — a band answers WHICH, never HOW MANY; the
sequence rides the edge-DAG, never the address):

  1. THE EVENT-SIGNAL. Per worldline, order its content turns (down the spawn-tree, parents before
     children — worldline_io.branch_keys), then read each turn's vector and compute the per-turn
     CONTENT-DRIFT `1 - cos(turn_vector, running_centroid)`. Event-INDEXED (the turn ordinal
     indexes it), NEVER host-time (Face-III, clock-purity).

  2. THE STAMP — membership enrichment. The capture path (mesh build-patch → ffzMembershipAddress)
     already mints `lar_ffz` as a membership address (`profile/theme.arc.measure.beat.pulse`, `_`
     naming an absent cell). This leg ENRICHES: it fills the absent BEAT cell with the turn's own
     identity (the grounding-ratchet label — same-turn blocks share a beat cell, so the ultrametric
     reads them adjacent), minting a fresh `worldline/` address only where no membership stamp
     stands. A cell LABELS; nothing tallies.

  3. THE RHYTHM TESTIMONY. `ffz_clock.recover_clock(drift_signal)` still runs per braid — as
     REPORT-ONLY testimony (beat period, lock quality, holdover) for the operator's read. The
     recovered period never enters an address: a count that entered the address would harden into
     the global-now anti-pattern the membership tree exists to refuse.

  4. THE DESYNC WITNESS. Each braid draws a `desync.roberts_phase` off a stable per-root hash;
     `phase_spread` witnesses the braids' mutual incommensurability. Report-only.

CLOCK-PURITY (the sighting ward, no-global-now): the stamp path imports NO host clock. A re-run
over the same braids mints the same addresses → an idempotent stamp. The worldline stays LOCAL —
it never federates.
