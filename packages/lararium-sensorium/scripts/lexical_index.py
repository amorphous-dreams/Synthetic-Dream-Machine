"""lexical_index — the LEXICAL recall surface as a DERIVED, REBUILDABLE view over the one content source.

A contentless SQLite FTS5 index (`content=''`) tokenizes chunk-spans and stores TOKENS ONLY — no verbatim
bytes at rest. A side `spans` table holds each chunk's `(cid, start, end)` offsets (no bytes either). A
query matches tokens → span rowids (BM25-ranked) → spans → verbatim resolved from the content plane by
cid + slice. So the mempalace gains an INDEPENDENT chunk-segmented lexical surface — a segmentation
DISTINCT from the content plane's turns — that duplicates NO source bytes and rebuilds from content alone
(the one-bit test). This is the standoff + external-content-FTS form the kupono data-model research named:
content is the single writable arbiter; this index is a disposable projection over it.
