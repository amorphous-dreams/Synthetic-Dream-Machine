"""holder_caps — the composition foundation for the mempalace-backed Python HOLDERS.

A HOLDER runs one plane of one sensorium: it consumes mempalace as a library, speaks NDJSON on
stdin/stdout, and holds a palace open for the node. The word "sidecar" names ONE thing in this
house — the upstream install at ~/.mempalace, a separate capability the House may accept — so the
processes we stand ourselves carry their own name (operator ruling, 2026-07-29).

NOT a base class to subclass. A LIBRARY OF CAPABILITIES (caps) that a holder
COMPOSES. Each holder (loci_io · structurepalace_io · form_encoder · kg_io) is a
NAMELESS entity whose identity IS its cap-stack — the set of caps it #has, fused
with the OPS it declares. The caps live here as free functions + one small
composition root; a holder imports the caps it needs, declares its ops as a
plain dict (verb → handler), and calls the root that wires the caps around them.

  entity (holder)   =  the caps it #has  +  the ops it declares
  component (cap)    =  one reusable behavior (free function / closure)
  composition root   =  make_dispatch · run_holder · serve_loop (wire, never own)

This is ECS (entity=holder, component=cap) fused with ocap dependency-injection
(the script HANDS the caps its store/handlers; the caps never reach back). No god
base-class, no inheritance tower, no central registry — isomorphism by
composition, not interface.

THE CAPS
========
Path:      canonical_path                        — realpath∘expanduser (∘normcase)
NDJSON:    read_ndjson_records                    — parse an NDJSON file/stdin → dicts
           make_dispatch                          — ops-registry → an NDJSON request handler
Serve:     serve_lock_path / acquire_serve_lock /
           acquire_root_lock / release_lock        — singleton and short rooted flock holds
           idle_ttl_seconds                       — env-read idle-reap TTL
           serve_loop                             — the raw-fd NDJSON loop + idle-reap
           run_holder                            — the serve composition root

The serve caps form the HEAVY shared machinery (structurepalace_io + form_encoder #has
the full serve stack); the batch CLIs (loci_io + kg_io) #has only the lighter
path/NDJSON caps — an entity carries only the components it needs.
