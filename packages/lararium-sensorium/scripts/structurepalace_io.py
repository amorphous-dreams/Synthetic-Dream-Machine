"""structurepalace_io — the substrate side of the `.structurepalace` memory-ast-unfolding palace.

A SECOND mempalace instance (the same ChromaDB engine, a separate palace dir) that
holds the per-turn parse-tree AST, keyed by its STRUCTURAL HASH (sha256 of the
canonical-JSON of the tree). Twin to the verbatim palace (`~/.mempalace`) and to
`.meshpalace`; it NEVER federates on the mesh — local, content-addressed, the eidetic
↔ semantic bridge.

The binding is CODE-LEVEL, navigable BOTH ways:
  - the verbatim drawer (in the verbatim palace) carries `lar_ast_hash`  → this entry's id
  - this entry carries `verbatim_sha` + `source_file`                    → that drawer

One holder process serves each palace dir — the reap-don't-pile invariant: never two holders
fighting the per-palace mine lock. The TS `makeStructurePalace` keys a singleton on the
canonical palace dir so a second `put` reuses this one process instead of spawning a pile.
The chroma handle itself lives in `mempalace.palace._DEFAULT_BACKEND._clients`, the shared
registry every reap path walks — this helper opens through `get_collection` and constructs
no client of its own, so closing a palace here reaches the same handle the CLI closes.

It is OUR code (the causal-island boundary's substrate side), NOT the submodule: it only
moves bytes across the boundary via `mempalace.palace.get_collection` (create-or-open),
storing the AST verbatim as the drawer document and the binding as flat metadata. It never
classifies, never decides — the sovereign parse stays in TS (@lararium/mesh).

Protocol — NDJSON over stdin/stdout, one JSON object per line; ONLY JSON responses go to
stdout (banners/library noise → stderr, which the TS side drains and ignores):

    -> {"id":1,"op":"ping"}
    <- {"id":1,"ok":true,"result":{"ready":true}}

    -> {"id":2,"op":"put","hash":H,"ast":"<canonical-json>","source_file":S,"verbatim_sha":V,"turn_key":K}
    <- {"id":2,"ok":true,"result":{"hash":H,"count":N}}

    -> {"id":3,"op":"get","hash":H}
    <- {"id":3,"ok":true,"result":{ <StructureEntry> | null }}

    -> {"id":5,"op":"query","query":"<free text>","k":8}
    <- {"id":5,"ok":true,"result":{"kind":K,"matches":[{"hash":H,"distance":D,"verbatim_sha":V,…}]}}

    -> {"id":4,"op":"kapae","turn_key":K,"set_aside_mark":M}
    <- {"id":4,"ok":true,"result":{"closed":N,"tombstoned":[H,…],"verbatim_shas":[V,…],"turn_key":K}}

KAPAE (rewind = set-aside, never erase) — the structurepalace twin of the worldline KG kapae.
Keyed by the USER turn's uuid (turn_key), which `put` threads into every provenance entry. A
gone turn drops its provenance line and decrements `count`; an entry whose count falls to ≤0 is
TOMBSTONED (`lar_tombstoned` stamped, the chroma row KEPT, excluded from recall) rather than
deleted (history preserved). Idempotent: a 2nd kapae for the same uuid finds the line already
gone → a no-op. A small sqlite reverse-index (`turnkey_index.sqlite3`, beside the chroma store —
mirrors kg_io's raw-sqlite-beside-chroma idiom) keeps the turn_key → structural_hash lookup O(1),
since chroma cannot where-filter inside a JSON provenance list.

# ── The STRUCTURAL ENCODER — a deterministic feature-vector over the AST SHAPE ───────
#
# The `.structurepalace` is addressed by EXACT id (the structural hash) for put/get/kapae — we
# never semantic-search it — so we supply our OWN vectors and NEVER invoke the palace's
# embedding model (no model load, no download, no network). The vector is the STRUCTURE
# PLANE's cohesion feed for the FFZ Measure servo (ffz-orchestrator, the 3rd quorum plane):
# it must be COSINE-MEANINGFUL — two structurally-similar trees land NEAR, dissimilar trees
# FAR. The retired hash-hex embedding could NOT do this (sibling trees hash to orthogonal
# noise); this one captures the AST's SHAPE, so the geometry carries semantics.
#
# The feature vector is two concatenated blocks, then L2-normalized (cosine = dot):
#   1. a NODE-TYPE HISTOGRAM (feature-hashed into a fixed number of buckets, so the open
#      node-type vocabulary maps to a fixed dimension) — the dominant fingerprint: trees
#      built from the same node-types overlap here.
#   2. TREE-SHAPE STATISTICS (depth · node-count · branching mean/max/spread · leaf
#      fraction · subtree size · balance) — each saturated to [0,1), so two trees of the
#      same silhouette read close even when their type-mix differs slightly.
#
# DETERMINISTIC + light: a single recursive walk, sha256 bucketing, pure arithmetic — no
# model, fast, reproducible (a re-harvest re-derives the byte-identical vector).
#
# FOLLOW-UPS (documented, NOT built): a richer geometry could replace the histogram with a
# tree-kernel (subtree / subpath / Weisfeiler-Lehman label-propagation) Gram-vector, or a
# LEARNED tree-embedding (a small TreeLSTM / GNN over the AST). Both are heavier (a kernel
# basis or a trained model) and break the "no-model, instant" invariant this encoder holds;
# they stay deferred behind this light feature-vector.
