"""nalu_gate — the reactive gate physics behind the capture stream, ported to py as pure caps.

The name tracks the BUILT mechanism, not the aspirational 'double-slit' metaphor: what actually
stands here reads as a **PLL lock-detector + a Schmitt-quorum servo + the coalesce window**. Three
composable caps the pipeline wires later:

  · SchmittLock  — THE streaming lock decision on top of the stateless recover_clock snapshot. It
                   holds LOCK / HOLDOVER / UNLOCKED across successive reads with DUAL thresholds
                   (hysteresis, so lock never chatters near one line) + a QUORUM (integrate-and-fire:
                   N reads above the line before it asserts LOCK) + a HOLDOVER grace (free-run on the
                   last beat before it drops). It NEVER fabricates a beat — below the low line long
                   enough, it damps to holdover and free-runs, marked provisional.
  · WindowServo / adapt_window — the COALESCE-family window servo (AIMD homeostat): grow the window
                   multiplicatively on overload (coalesce more, each flush carries a fresher state
                   for less work), shrink additively on headroom. Ports gate-tuning.adaptWindow.
  · CoalesceGate — the coalesce-family gate (a burst of marks collapses to ONE flush, newest wins,
                   intermediates fade, no reserve). Driven by an INJECTED ordinal clock — no host
                   wall-time — so it stays deterministic and honors clock-purity. Ports the physics
                   of projection-nalu.CoalesceGate.

CLOCK-PURITY: no cap here reads time.time(). The caller drives the ordinal (the recovered beat, or a
tick counter); the gate constitutes its timing FROM that drive, never fetches a global now.
