/**
 * gen_cli_verbs — emit fixtures/cli-verbs.json from the ACTUAL `lares` command table.
 *
 * Derives the verb list from the built `COMMAND_NAMES` export (packages/lares-cli), so the
 * fixture never drifts from the real CLI surface: re-run after adding/renaming a command.
 * YIN's three-way parity test (CLI command-table ↔ MCP tool-set ↔ VERB_SEATS) reads the output.
 *
 * The isomorphism (operator ruling): `lares`-CLI ↔ `lares`-MCP across the WHOLE verb-set. The six
 * lifecycle tools mirror today; every other verb reads NOT-YET-MIRRORED (the MCP surface grows into
 * it), never permanently CLI-only. `cli_forms` maps each MCP tool name to its CLI spelling — each
 * mirror rides the one `sense` door (`sense pour`, `sense status`, `sense worldline kapae`).
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/gen_cli_verbs.mjs        (writes fixtures/cli-verbs.json)
 *         node scripts/gen_cli_verbs.mjs --check (fails if the on-disk fixture drifts)
 *
