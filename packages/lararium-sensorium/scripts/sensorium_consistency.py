"""sensorium_consistency — the py twin of the mesh H0 organ (RUN-ARC.md #3, owed-py-twin paid).

Ports the CONTRACT of packages/lararium-mesh/src/sensorium-consistency.ts — the Robinson
CONSISTENCY-RADIUS over a sensorium's LI (sheaf) planes — carrying the same three crucible
cautions the TS oracle carries:

  (a) value lives in ENGINEERED OVERLAPS — planes with disjoint domains constrain nothing,
      so the radius reads VACUOUSLY 0 and the verdict flags it rather than faking a glue;
  (b) the restrictions run NON-Lipschitz, so the radius reads as a DISAGREEMENT SIGNAL,
      never a distortion bound (`signalKind` says so on the wire);
  (c) the ki co-consistency mirrors as the cosheaf PUSHFORWARD dual — extension up into a
      shared coface stalk, disagreement on codomain CO-OVERLAPS — never a cosheaf faked
      through a contravariant restriction.

The li-radius verdict:
  radius == 0 and not vacuous  ->  the li-planes GLUE (a global section stands);
  radius  > 0                  ->  an OBSTRUCTION, localized per pair;
  vacuous                      ->  no engineered overlap constrained it — 0 buys nothing.

THE FOURTH CAUTION, AND IT OUTRANKS THE THREE ABOVE — A TOWER GLUES FOR FREE.

  The li planes hold neither disjoint NOR independent: they NEST. content -> structure -> form
  each COARSEN the one before (the keystone, lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/api/living-grammar-palace#spine),
  and structure carries 97.8% of the record's own bits (measured exactly, `plane_capacity` — a count
  off the partition, no estimator). A chain of quotients holds NO OBSTRUCTION TO GLUING: dim H1 = 0
  BY CONSTRUCTION. So the radius reads ~0 on every bed it has ever seen, and that zero names a
  TAUTOLOGY — one plane heard three times — never a finding.

  Caution (a) guards the wrong pathology. It fears planes too DISJOINT (a vacuous 0). The measured
  pathology runs the other way: planes too DEPENDENT (a trivial 0). Both read 0; only one is caught.

  SO THE RADIUS CERTIFIES NOTHING AT A PLANE BOUNDARY, and this organ says so rather than reporting
  health it cannot earn. It keeps its job at a FEDERATION boundary — genuinely distinct contexts,
  where an obstruction can exist to be found. The li-disagreement question re-seats on the two-part
  code: an event that moves the corpus LENGTHENS l(G)+l(D|G) until the grammar re-earns its bits.
  One currency, one ledger, no pooling — and no gong that fires on a single artifact wearing three
  coats.

  `verdict` therefore carries `tower_trivial` whenever the planes stand in a coarsening chain: the
  zero gets NAMED, never spent.

The native stalk pseudometrics ride along (cosine · jaccard · the DECKARD characteristic-
vector tree distance — the structure plane's hot path). The shelved TS paths (pq-gram
refine, cubic exact TED) stay TS-side; this twin carries the hot path only, named here.

Arithmetic runs PURE python float64 in the TS statement order, so the committed parity
fixture binds the two bodies at 1e-5 without reduction-order drift.

The `fixture` face regenerates the committed TS<->py parity fixture (the migration gate:
one fixture per numeric):
