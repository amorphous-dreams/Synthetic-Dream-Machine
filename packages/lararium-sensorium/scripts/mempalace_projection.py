"""mempalace_projection — the mempalace cap composed as a THIN, DERIVED projection over the one content
source.

It ties the derived recall surfaces the keel carries: a LEXICAL surface (contentless FTS5 over chunk-spans)
+ an ENTITY-GRAPH (inverted index + hallways), both keyed by content cid, holding NO verbatim. `index_block`
fans one block into every surface; `hybrid_search` fuses the lexical + entity recalls by Reciprocal Rank
Fusion (RRF) — the rank-merge that dodges BM25-vs-graph score incompatibility. The whole projection drops
and rebuilds from content (the one-bit test): content is the single writable source, this cap is a
disposable combined-arms VIEW over it — the shape the kupono data-model research named.
