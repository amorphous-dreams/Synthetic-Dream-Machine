# The golden-corpus parity gate retired here. It hashed 250 memes out of `bags/lares` — authored
# content under continuous revision — so it measured the fold against ground that moves: an edit and a
# grammar regression produced the same red. It fired on 60 memes in seventeen days, every one a content
# edit, and never once caught a grammar change.
#
# The four properties it bundled now sit on beds that suit them, in `test_fold_specimens.py`:
# hashes pinned over FROZEN specimens · coverage measured against the grammar's own node-types.json ·
# the living corpus gated on invariants (no ERROR node, spans inside their ground) · determinism over
# real specimens. `fixtures/manifest-0.1.0.json` stays as the record of what was pinned and when.
