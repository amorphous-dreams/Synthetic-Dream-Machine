"""Re-bake the frozen specimen hashes — the author-side half of the regression sentinel.

The gate in `test_fold_specimens.py` refuses a fold that moves. When a grammar change moves one ON
PURPOSE, the ritual is to re-bake IN THE SAME COMMIT, so the diff shows both the grammar change and
every hash it moved, side by side, for a reviewer to weigh.

    python host-py/bake_specimens.py            # show what would move
    python host-py/bake_specimens.py --write    # move it

Printing the delta before writing matters: a bake that silently rewrites the manifest turns the gate
into a formality, which is how the corpus gate this replaced ended up unread.
