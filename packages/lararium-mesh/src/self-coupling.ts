 * self-coupling — the SELF as the coupling READ-OUT, not a sixth sense (IIT's

 * well they CORRESPOND, infer P(common cause) — the probability they spring from ONE underlying
 * act — and report a blend weighted by it, while ALWAYS keeping the sovereign estimates. Fusion
 * is a DIAL governed by inferred causal structure, never a merge: the interiors are never
 * destroyed, and the bind is REVERSIBLE the instant correspondence drops (the McGurk regime is
 * correct only when P(common) → 1, and must un-bind when cues diverge).
 *
 * Correspondence rides in from the coupling substrate — high R (transfer-entropy) + temporal
 * proximity ⇒ high correspondence ⇒ high P(common). The self is where the five senses become
 * one coherent percept without any of them ceasing to be sovereign.
