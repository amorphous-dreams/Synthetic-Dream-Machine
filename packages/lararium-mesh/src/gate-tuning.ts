 * (multiplicative back-off / additive recovery is what converges where MIMD/AIAD oscillate). The
 * caller feeds the recently-observed (ideally EWMA-smoothed) flush cost; a deadband holds the window
 * inside the band so noise isn't chased; the result clamps to [minMs, maxMs].

 * Verdict: apply ONLY to the variable-cost reconcile gate
 * (disk). A DISPLAY-BOUND newest-wins gate stays FIXED, pinned to the frame clock — tuning its
