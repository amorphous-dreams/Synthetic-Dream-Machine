/**
 * ciphertext-cas — the ENCRYPT-ON-CAS primitive: a body leaves the CRDT as CIPHERTEXT, content-addressed by
 * `cid = BLAKE3(ciphertext)`, so an untrusted member relay blind-transits + verifies it holding NO secret
 * (content-resolution.mem #cad-storage, verify-cap ⊥ read-cap). This is the cad-private addressing mode.
 *
 * THE SELF-PROVING SEAL (verify-cap, secret-free). The address IS `BLAKE3(ciphertext)`: any relay recomputes
 * `BLAKE3(bytes) == cid` with NOTHING but the bytes — no key, no per-Nexus secret, no read-cap. That recompute
 * IS the member blind-transit lane's honesty (the relay carries what it can never read AND proves integrity
 * without the read-cap). `verifyCiphertextCid` is that check; it routes through `digestsEqual`, so a stored
 * bare-hex value still matches a freshly-computed `blake3:` tag (agile-digest, fork-① — the sha256→BLAKE3
 * migration rides IN the multihash tag; an old cid stays parseable beside a new one).
 *
 * THE READ-CAP (message-locked, per-Nexus). The body is sealed by a message-locked convergent construction:
 *   · messageKey = BLAKE3(plaintext, key = nexusSecret)          — the READ-CAP; message-locked to (content, secret)
 *   · keystream  = BLAKE3(KEYSTREAM_DOMAIN, key = messageKey, dkLen = |plaintext|)   — a per-body XOF keystream
 *   · ciphertext = plaintext ⊕ keystream
 *   · cid        = BLAKE3(ciphertext)                            — the VERIFY-CAP, secret-free
 * DEDUP is per-Nexus by construction: same (content, secret) → same messageKey → same keystream → same
 * ciphertext → same cid. A DIFFERENT per-Nexus secret → a different messageKey → a different cid → NO
 * cross-Nexus dedup (no confirmation-of-file leak across Nexuses). The read-cap (messageKey) rides the PRIVATE
 * lane (keyhive) and NEVER crosses the relay; the relay sees only ciphertext + cid.
 *
 * ── THE ACCEPTED RESIDUAL (fork-② = A, operator-ruled 2026-07-21) ────────────────────────────────────────
 * A PER-NEXUS convergence secret (not per-file random) admits the classic convergent-encryption INSIDER
 * confirmation-of-file residual: a Nexus member holding the secret can test whether a candidate plaintext
 * seals to a held cid. The operator ACCEPTS this — a Nexus member sits INSIDE the causal-island trust
 * boundary. The OPRF rate-limit throttle [fork-②-B] is DEFERRED to the Sensorium machina and NOT built here.
 *
 * ── THE SURFACED SUB-FORK (fork-②, secret DERIVATION — Provisional, NOT wired here) ──────────────────────
 * This module keeps the per-Nexus secret an INJECTED 32-byte input. WHERE it derives (from Nexus-admission
 * material, re-derivable by every member on re-admission — vs an independent high-entropy secret VERSIONED by
 * a wax-sealed charter epoch) is the keyhive↔charter boundary, and NO shared per-Nexus secret source stands
 * today (the charter carries PUBLIC keys only). The cleanest primitive ships here; the derivation + custody +
 * epoch-rotation is surfaced as the honest gap (the seal FAILS CLOSED with no secret — see the node installer).
 *
 * Platform-blind: `@noble/hashes/blake3` (audited, browser-shippable) + agile-digest + crypto `hex` only.
