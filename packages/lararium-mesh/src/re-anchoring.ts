/**
 * re-anchoring — the record that a guest's dwelling moved from a HOST to a REALM, and nothing else.
 *
 * A guest dwells WITH a host: a dyad, one edge, and the historically fatal shape — across six surveyed
 * hospitality institutions, one-sided admission always booked the shortfall as RANK. A realm's own ceremony
 * re-anchors that dwelling INTO the realm, and this records THAT it happened.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS MUST NOT HOLD, AND WHY THE OMISSION IS THE DESIGN ──────────────────────────────────────
 * It carries NO quorum rule, waiting period, franchise, test, method, rite-name, or any other validating
 * predicate. Communities that need shelter already hold their own rites, and a CONFIGURABLE rite is still
 * this stack's rite with someone else's values poured in — the moment a schema ships fields for a ceremony,
 * those fields have specified everyone's ceremony and called it a default.
 *
 * The refusal is stated in the TYPE rather than only here, because a comment gets skimmed and a record of an
 * unspecified ceremony is a strange object: it says something happened that we may not describe. Any later
 * hand will feel the urge to add one validating field. That urge is the failure; this shape is the ward.
 *
 * Prior art, and it is normative: Privacy Pass (RFC 9576 §3.5.1) makes the attestation procedure "a
 * deployment-specific option and outside the scope of the issuance protocol" — the token carries that
 * attestation succeeded and nothing about what made it succeed.
 *
 * ── THE ATTESTORS RIDE PLURAL, AND UN-THRESHOLDED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * One attestor rebuilds the dyad inside a signed wrapper, which is the failure this record exists against.
 * So attestation runs as a SET, unordered, each signing independently — and this module states NO rule about
 * how many suffice. The reader decides, at the reader's own policy.
 *
 * Two standards ship exactly that: RFC 9162 §8.1.6 leaves "the quantity and form of evidence" to "a client's
 * local policy", and W3C VC Data Integrity §2.1.1 gives proof SETS "where the order of proofs does not
 * matter". The threshold family (t-of-n, FROST, BLS aggregation) fails here by construction: it emits ONE
 * signature that verifies only at t, so the sufficiency rule bakes into the cryptography AND the individual
 * attestors vanish. You cannot count what aggregated. A naive list costs bytes and buys the reader's seat.
 *
 * ── ATTESTER ⊥ MINTER ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The party that ran the rite MUST NOT be the party that mints the record. Privacy Pass documents the price:
 * its joint Attester-and-Issuer deployment reads as the WEAKENED model. Here that runs structurally — the
 * record carries no minter identity at all, so nothing in it can reconstruct who convened what.
 *
 * ── ONE ARTIFACT, FOLDED TWO WAYS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * An EVENT on write; accrued DEPTH on read. A re-anchoring attested at a position IS the datum depth accrues
 * from, so building them apart would build them twice.
 *
 * Platform-blind: rides ./base-doc + ./crypto only. NO node: imports, no key, no I/O.
 * Meme: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/re-anchoring-record

 * more freely by its operator, where skew arrives on purpose as a testing feature.
 *
 * THE ATTESTOR-PLURALITY TENSION, carried in the open. RFC 9576 §6.2 documents that "increasing the number of
 * required attestation procedures could decrease the overall anonymity set size" — so as the attestor count
 * rises, the intersection of realms whose dwellers would jointly attest NARROWS, and the record begins naming
 * the person by naming who vouched. The dyad cure and the no-global-identifier cure pull against each other.
 * The candidate shape (operator-seated, unresolved): carry `attestor` as a PER-REALM pseudonym rather than a
