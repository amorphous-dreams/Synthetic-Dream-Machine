/**
 * handle-announce — the bridge that carries a handle-card onto a SYNCED doc, so announcing a Handle rides the
 * transport the mesh already runs.
 *
 * The card + the reader rule + the recogniser book are pure and transport-blind (handle-card, handle-book).
 * This module lands a signed card in a LarDoc as a namespaced tiddler and reads cards back out — nothing more.
 * Once the card is a tiddler in a read-open doc, the EXISTING Automerge sync distributes it over the relay
 * (browser↔node↔browser) with no new channel, exactly as the daemon doc already carries keyhive cap-events.
 * Which read-open bag HOSTS the announce is the caller's wiring choice — the cards ride under their own key
 * prefix, so they coexist cleanly with whatever else the doc holds.
 *
 * NEXUS-SCOPED, NEVER GLOBAL (causal islands). "Public" here means public within the causal island that has
 * synced the announce doc — the largest practical such island is the Nexus (the WHO plane, sibling to the
 * meshpalace FLOW-map's WHERE plane). There is no global DreamNet registry of Handles, because there is no
 * global now: a Handle federates exactly as far as its announce doc syncs, and crossing to another Nexus
 * RE-ANNOUNCES. Re-announcement is cheap by the card's self-certifying design — the SAME signed card re-lands
 * in the target Nexus's doc with no re-sign, and the tiddler key stays stable (it names the identity KIND, so
 * recognition carries across islands), while the hosting bag carries the island-scoped reach.
 *
 * WRITE-OPEN, READ-CERTIFIED — the board gates nothing; the recogniser decides standing. `writeHandleAnnounce`
 * runs NO membership check: any nym's card lands at its key, including one standing in no PersonaGroup, no
 * cabal, and no recogniser's book. `readHandleAnnounces` filters SHAPE and certifies nothing. Standing arrives
 * only as a READ verdict, from the card's own chain (`verifyHandleCard` / `HandleBook`).
 *
 * A membership gate added to the WRITE path reads as a REGRESSION, never a hardening. To refuse a stranger at
 * write time the writer must consult a set of who-may-announce — and that set IS the compiled registry the
 * registry-filter law rejects. It would also buy nothing: an uncertified card already loses at the read, and a
 * certified one needs nobody's permission to travel. `tests/who-board-write-open.test.ts` welds this shut.
 *
 * Pure and I/O-free: it mutates a LarDoc draft the caller opened inside `handle.change()`, and reads a plain
 * LarDoc. It holds no key and touches no network. Untrusted by construction — a card arrives from an open
 * synced doc, so reading NEVER throws on a malformed tiddler (a bad entry is skipped, and every surviving card
 * still passes the recogniser rule before it is trusted).
 *
 * Canon: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/lararium-identity#the-oracle-plane (the read-open plane the card
 * publishes on); lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/persona-circle#the-vault (the publication model).
