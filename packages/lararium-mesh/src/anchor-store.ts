/**
 * anchor-store — the veiled-Handle's sentinel-anchor SHORE (platform-blind).
 *
 * A vessel binds to its veiled Handle through three sentinel ids the founding ceremony mints off
 * keyhive's CSPRNG — unreproducible from any seed. Those ids live OUTSIDE the wiped substrate so a
 * rebirth reforges the store while re-reading the SAME anchors, and the Handle survives the substrate.
 *
 * The core owns only the SHAPE + the roster contract; the platform supplies HOW it persists. Anchors
 * carry PUBLIC doc-ids — no secret material rides here, so no seal touches this shore. (The at-rest
 * seal governs the keyhive ARCHIVE, a distinct node-adapter concern; the core never sees seal policy.)
 *
 * PLURALITY PONO at the identity layer: a vessel that wears several personas anchors EACH to its OWN
 * veiled Handle (a distinct PersonaGroup + MeshCabal + agentId), so the store keys by handle-index. The
 * ROSTER reads the store's OWN keys — an explicit record the writer maintains, never a dir-scan pattern.
