/**
 * stream-adapter — the per-MODALITY intake abstraction that generalizes the sensorium-for-FORM
 * (the corpus-machina, corpus.md) to ANY input stream (pure, dependency-free).
 *
 * The sensorium is ~90% modality-INVARIANT. Its planes — content=embed · structure=shape-vector ·
 * bands=MODWT+ecp · form=induction · coupling=RTransferEntropy — read numeric vectors, nested shape
 * trees, and text; NONE of them know "this came from a text corpus". Only the INTAKE (text →
 * tree-sitter / stanza) is text-specific. This module lifts that shore: a {@link StreamAdapter}
 * supplies ONLY the intake (raw → {@link StreamFrame}s); the shared CORE ({@link composePalace})
 * routes each frame's populated slots to the matching plane.
 *
 * ## Composition-thin
 *
 * An adapter carries ONLY what is genuinely app-specific; every shared behavior lives in a free
 * function the CORE applies. Give an adapter a slot each one fills identically and that slot becomes
 * a field nobody reads; give it a body each one copies and the copies drift apart. So the surface
 * here stays EXACTLY `modality · mode · ingest`, plane behavior lives in the injected
 * {@link PlaneSink} the shared driver applies, and a new modality adds an `ingest` and nothing else.
 *
 * ## The two doors (why the frame carries three slots)
 *
 * A stream feeds the planes through the slots its modality affords — no adapter fills all three:
 *   · a NATIVELY-NUMERIC on-box stream (sensor · market · audio · EEG · CI/CD tick) fills `signal`
 *     directly → the bands + coupling planes read it verbatim (the `--signal` NDJSON door);
 *   · TEXT fills `content` (+ `structure` when a parse is wired) → the content plane embeds it, and
 *     the bands plane DERIVES the cohesion signal from those embeddings downstream (the `--palace`
 *     door). Text's `signal` stays empty at ingest — cohesion is a CROSS-frame property of the
 *     embeddings, not producible from one chunk (see {@link composePalace}, the derived-bands door).
