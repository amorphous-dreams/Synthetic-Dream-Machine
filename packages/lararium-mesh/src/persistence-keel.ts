/**
 * persistence-keel — the PersistencePalace lifecycle. A persistence pattern-integrity ANY sensorium composes as a
 * cosheaf `#has` cap: it persists content as an immutable TESTIMONY whose only dial is STANDING,
 * earned by distinct-signer witness edges and cooled by a per-instance half-life that IS the
 * maturation mode — differing stable-from-ephemeral by policy values alone.
 *
 * THE STANDING LAW: a persisted trace carries one STANDING dial — only distinct-signer witness
 * edges (polarity +1) raise it, only defeaters (polarity −1) lower it, repetition and recall move
 * it not at all; at the floor the trace rides silent, weighed at floor gain on re-entry, never
 * obeyed. Standing is a KI (cosheaf) quantity — it depends on edges OUTSIDE the trace (distinct
 * signers EXTEND it, local→global), never a li-restriction of the trace itself.
 *
 * THE THREE REGISTERS (never fused): CONFIDENCE — a forward vow of commitment (provisional→canon),
 * seeded before a claim, computed by NOTHING here; a recorder's vow rides `pubinfo` verbatim.
 * STANDING — what witnesses EARN (the Law-of-5s rating ladder r-axis: noise→data→meme→ano→kapu);
 * this, and only this, is the keel's dial. CORRESPONDENCE — Maybe-Logic's pole-shy fuzzy truth,
 * encoded NOWHERE; it lives in the reader.
 *
 * THE MATURATION MODE = the half-life (Keystone-Cutter's collapse): policy.halfLife === null →
 * append-only-witness (authority stores, e.g. the Mempalace: standing never cools, only a defeater
 * lowers it) · policy.halfLife finite → affinity-maturation (ephemeral sensoria: a witness edge's
 * contribution decays by half-life, so un-re-vouched standing cools toward the floor). This
 * completes the 7 biological moves — decay-as-tunable-dial was the one the keel lacked.
 *
 * DERIVE, NEVER STORE: the record persists only content + a signed witness-log; standing and voice
 * derive at read, so a persisted record cannot CLAIM "spoken" without the witnesses backing it.
 *
 * PURITY: platform-blind, immutable, no clock. Decay takes a caller-supplied `now` tick (the FFZ
 * rhythmic address rides in, as fisher-rao's windowedDrift does) — the keel never reads a clock.
 *
 * Standing ceiling law: the mechanical lifecycle NEVER lifts the dial into the top band (kapu,
 * 17..20) — kapu seats by talk-story consensus only; the ceiling pins at 16 (ano's top).

/* ══════════════════ THE WITNESS SIGNATURE — the string the log was always described to carry ══════════════════
 *
 * The keel's header names the witness-log SIGNED, and the standing law only counts DISTINCT-SIGNER edges —
 * but a `signer` field is a bare CLAIM until a key proves it. This block gives the witness edge its
 * cryptographic string: the signer draws an Ed25519 signature over canonical bytes binding the TESTIMONY it
 * attests (by content-address) to its own vouch/defeat, and a verifier re-derives those bytes and checks the
 * signature. It mirrors the wax-stamp floor exactly (proofBytes · mint · verifySig) and rides the SAME
 * @noble/ed25519 the auth-wire and wax-stamp keels already ride — no new crypto enters the stack.
 *
 * WHAT IT ATTESTS — a PAST, never a global now (preserves no-global-now / causal-islands): "signer S,
 * standing at causal frontier F, corroborated (+1) / defeated (−1) the testimony content-addressed by
 * `claimCid`." `frontier` is an ITC bound-past (the same opaque frontier the provenance inlines), so the seal
 * freezes a causal fact — it says nothing about the testimony's LIVE standing, which DERIVES at read from the
 * whole distinct-signer log ({@link reentryPrior}), never from any one signature.
 *
 * OUT OF SCOPE — deliberately: (a) the standing ARITHMETIC stays signature-agnostic pure math. {@link standingUnder}
 * counts distinct signers over a log it TRUSTS, exactly as wax-stamp's `classifySeal` trusts its injected
 * `verifySig` — but that trust is EARNED upstream, never assumed. The palace `witness` gate runs
 * {@link verifyWitnessSig} deny-by-default on EVERY edge BEFORE it enters the log (a MANDATORY gate, not an
 * optional courtesy: an absent or bad signature → do not append). So the dial only ever reads verified edges,
 * and verification lives at the gate, never inside the arithmetic. (b) carrying this string
 * THROUGH the dumb python store (persistence_io) so a re-loaded edge still verifies is an owed cross-language
 * fixture (the parity manifest already names the debt) — the sovereign keel mints and checks the seal; the
 * store need not understand it. (c) WHO may witness (authorization) is the caller's policy, not the

/* ════════════════════════════ THE ADMISSION GATE ════════════════════════════
 *
 * A claim earns its place iff THE STORE'S OWN CODE CANNOT BEAT IGNORANCE ON IT.
 *
 * ── WHY `−log2 p(c)` IS NOT BITS ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * For a continuous density, `−log2 p(x)` reads a DIFFERENTIAL entropy, never a code length: a tight
 * density exceeds 1 and the "bits" go NEGATIVE, and no one spends −6.5 bits. A real code length needs a
 * quantization step Δ — Cover & Thomas, *Elements of Information Theory* 2e, Thm 8.3.1 (§8.3): for a
 * Riemann-integrable density, H(X^Δ) + log Δ → h(X), so coding x to precision Δ costs
 * `−log2 p(x) + d·log2(1/Δ)` bits. Δ never cancels against a disk figure (dims × 32 for an f32), so
 * "surprisal > storage cost" compares two DIFFERENT KINDS of quantity and the verdict moves with Δ.
 *
 * ── WHAT DOES CANCEL ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Δ cancels EXACTLY between two codes for the SAME object at the SAME precision. So the gate compares two
 * CODES, never a code against a disk figure:
 *
 *     bitsSaved(c) = [−log2 p₀(c) + d·log2(1/Δ)] − [−log2 p₁(c) + d·log2(1/Δ)]
 *                  = log2( p₁(c) / p₀(c) )              ← Δ gone; a real, signed bit-count
 *
 *     ADMIT  ⟺  bitsSaved(c) ≤ 0  ⟺  the store's code prices c WORSE than ignorance does.
 *
 * Zero names no threshold anyone chose: it names the TIE between two code lengths, and taking the shorter
 * code IS the MDL rule (Grünwald, *The Minimum Description Length Principle*, MIT Press 2007; tutorial
 * arXiv math/0406077). The gate carries no dial, and `PersistencePolicy` offers none.
 *
 * ── THE TWO CODES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * p₀ — IGNORANCE: the UNIFORM density on the unit sphere S^(d−1). It carries ZERO parameters and knows
 *      nothing whatever about the store. True ignorance, not a simpler fit.
 * p₁ — THE STORE: a von Mises–Fisher density, `f(x; μ, κ) = C_d(κ)·exp(κ·μᵀx)`, whose log-density runs
 *      LINEAR in the cosine the store already measures. μ and κ come from the mean resultant length
 *      r̄ = ‖Σuᵢ‖/n in closed form — κ̂ ≈ r̄(d − r̄³)/(1 − r̄²) — Banerjee, Dhillon, Ghosh & Sra,
 *      "Clustering on the Unit Hypersphere using von Mises-Fisher Distributions", JMLR 6:1345–1382 (2005).
 *
 * Both densities integrate against the SAME surface measure, so the ratio collapses to
 *
 *     bitsSaved(c) = [ ln(C_d(κ)·Area(S^(d−1))) + κ·cos(c, μ) ] / ln 2
 *
 * and the decision boundary reads as an INFERRED cosine:  cos* = −ln(C_d(κ)·Area) / κ. The store MEASURES
 * its own similarity threshold from its own concentration. Nobody types 0.5.
 *
 * ── WHY THE SPHERE, AND WHAT IT COSTS US ──────────────────────────────────────
 * A diagonal Gaussian is the WRONG family here, and not merely imprecise. Embeddings ride the unit sphere
 * in a narrow anisotropic cone (Ethayarajh, EMNLP 2019; Gao et al., ICLR 2019), so a Gaussian's radial
 * variance reads ~0 and its per-dim scales carry almost no shape signal at d≈384 — a Gaussian-vs-pooled-
 * Gaussian ratio then measures the two codes' DEGREES OF FREEDOM (heavier tails price outliers cheaper)
 * rather than novelty, and MEASURABLY INVERTS: it refuses genuine novelty and admits near-duplicates. The
 * vMF ratio carries no such term because ignorance has no parameters to differ in.
 *
 * The gate therefore reads DIRECTION. It L2-normalizes both the store and the candidate, so two claims
 * differing only in magnitude read as one claim. For an embedding store (already unit-norm) that discards
 * nothing. For a store of unnormalized readings it names a real narrowing, and it names it out loud.
 *
 * ── NEVER A NEIGHBOURHOOD — AND HUBNESS IS THE REASON ──────────────────────────
 * A k-NN population makes p₁ a FUNCTION OF THE CANDIDATE: it then normalizes to nothing, stops being a
 * probability distribution over the claim space, and log2(p₁/p₀) stops being a difference of code lengths
 * at all. Worse, in high dimension a k-NN list is not even local: k-occurrence skews hard, points near the
 * data centroid enter almost every list (hubs) and far points enter none (antihubs) — Radovanović,
 * Nanopoulos & Ivanović, "Hubs in Space", JMLR 11:2487–2531 (2010) — so a distance-based gate admits
 * ANTIHUBS on geometry alone (the swamping effect: high-dim distance outlier detection yields false
 * positives, not false negatives). This gate reads NO neighbours. It reads one running vector sum over the
 * admitted store, which no candidate can steer.
 *
 * ── COST ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * {@link StoreCode} carries (n, Σ unit-vectors). An admitted claim folds in at O(d). An admit costs O(d)
 * plus one Bessel evaluation. NO store read, NO O(n) scan, NO index probe.
 *
 * ── PREQUENTIAL HONESTY (the anti-manufacture law) ────────────────────────────
 * A model fitted to a store and then asked whether a member of that store looks novel manufactures its own
 * finding. Here a candidate is ALWAYS priced by a code built from claims strictly BEFORE it — Dawid's
 * prequential principle (JRSS-A 147:278–292, 1984; Grünwald 2007 ch. 6). {@link prequentialBits} replays
 * that and returns the cumulative ledger: if the store's code does not beat uniform over its own history,
 * the store learned NOTHING and every verdict it issued read as a coin-flip. The instrument reports its own
 * blindness — measured, on a directionless store, it does exactly that.

/**
 * THE PREQUENTIAL CALIBRATION — the gate's own honesty check, and the only certification it accepts.
 *
 * Replay a claim stream through the LIVE gate: each claim priced by a code built from the claims admitted
 * strictly BEFORE it, and folded in only if it was admitted. Accumulate the ledger. A positive
 * `bitsSaved` says the store's code genuinely beats uniform on its own history — it learned a direction, and
 * its refusals stand on that. A `bitsSaved` at or below zero says the store learned NOTHING uniform did not
 * already know, and every verdict it issued read as a coin-flip on noise. Run this before trusting a gate on
 * a new corpus; a gate that cannot beat ignorance has manufactured its finding.
