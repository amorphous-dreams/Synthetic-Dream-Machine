/**
 * worldline-trajectory — the PERMAINAN SUBSTRATE: the Turn→Trajectory functor (worldline-TIME ×
 * form-SPACE = the path through the jurus). Pure, IO-free; the node-side holder feeds it.
 *
 * The QA-Lab flow-lens reads a *permainan* — a trajectory through move-space. The form-graph
 * (.formpalace) maps each turn's *jurus* (its form-vector = a position in move-space, the two-planes
 * CONTINUOUS plane). This module orders those positions by the worldline HAPPENED-BEFORE (the
 * rhythmic clock / ITC edge-DAG, mesh/worldline-clock), so a handle's turns become a PATH — the
 * thing the flow-lens instrument (CRQA · Fisher-Rao · the null test) will measure NEXT loop.
 *
 * THE FUNCTOR (Turn→Trajectory): a handle's captured turns → its worldline-ordered form-vector
 * sequence. Within ONE worldline the happened-before is TOTAL (an agent runs sequentially), so the
 * order rides the node-monotonic `tickCounter` (the WorldlineEvent order, mesh/worldline-clock);
 * the rhythmic `clock`/address rides along for display. Cross-handle concurrency is the ITC registry's
 * job (worldlineCompare) — the flow-lens reads ONE handle's path at a time.
 *
 * NULL-READY (the paper's non-negotiable): {@link shuffleTrajectory} rides cheaply alongside — a
 * scale-graded order-scramble (window-banded Fisher-Yates over a SEEDED rng) so a real trajectory can
 * be measured against a shuffled baseline. This module builds the SUBSTRATE (the measurable path +
 * the shuffle primitive), NEVER the null TEST itself (that is the flow-lens instrument, deferred).
 *
 * Also here: {@link worldlineCausalFromEdges} — project the in-memory ITC registry (WorldlineCausal,
 * the Well-1 causal foundation) from the durable edge-DAG (worldline-edge triples), per the
 * worldline-clock note "the ITC verdict re-projects from those triples when they land."
