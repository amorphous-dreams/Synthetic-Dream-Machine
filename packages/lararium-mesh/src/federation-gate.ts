/**
 * FederationGate — the deny-by-default relay-share decision (the V5 socket).
 *
 * A vessel's Automerge `sharePolicy` decides which docs it VOLUNTEERS to a sync
 * peer. In-process island peers (MessageChannel workers) are house members and
 * share freely; a WS *relay* peer (LarWSClientAdapter) reaches the wider Nexus,
 * so the vessel must NOT blanket-share every doc with it — the private planes
 * (catalog, personal, draft, wikis, corpus bags) stay home, only the public
 * federation surface crosses.
 *
 * This gate names that decision behind ONE narrow, deny-by-default shore, shaped
 * deliberately like `IdentitySlot.verifyCapability(docUrl, "read")`: the alpha
 * allow-set fork and the V5 capability-check fork are the SAME gate at two
 * capability resolutions — the deterministic allow-set IS a degenerate cap set.
 * So the V5 `KeyhiveIdentitySlot` swaps in behind this interface with no
 * call-site churn.
 *
 * HONEST BOUND: `sharePolicy` is ADVISORY. This gate closes the ACCIDENTAL leak
 * (the repo stops VOLUNTEERING private docs to the relay), and the private
 * planes' random 16-byte document ids give effective confidentiality against a
 * peer that cannot guess an id. TRUE crypto read-control — denying a *guessed*
 * id and hiding the bytes — is the V5 KeyhiveIdentitySlot / BeeKEM path, out of
 * this shore's scope. This gate IS that shore's alpha socket.
 *
 * SECOND HONEST BOUND — THIS GATE OFFERS NO PROBE RESISTANCE, and nothing here should read as
 * though it did. It decides what a peer may PULL; it never conceals that a lararium answers at
 * all. An adversary that connects and speaks the opening move learns what a passive observer
 * could not — the move a national censor has run for over a decade, at a measured median
 * half-second, from prober addresses too numerous and too short-lived to block.
 *
 * What probe resistance would require, none of which this shore holds: the CLIENT authenticating
 * BEFORE the responder emits a byte (else the responder itself serves as the oracle) · SILENCE on
 * failure rather than a rejection, since a rejection confesses that something understood the
 * question · and a PER-VESSEL gating secret, because a mesh-wide one hands a single infiltrator a
 * universal probe key. That belongs to the transport, not to a share-policy shore — named here so
 * a later reader never mistakes this gate's deny for a mesh that stays unobserved.

 * are both in scope at the sharePolicy shore. TODAY neither vessel has that at its
 * main-thread sharePolicy: the live KeyhiveProvider runs INSIDE the daemon-island
 * worker (bootDaemonKeyhive over the worker composite), and the bag↔docId registry
 * lives there too — the founding ceremony DISPOSES its transient provider before
 * returning, and LarVessel (whose `identity` field would carry the slot) is not on
 * the live factory path. So both vessels pass `identity = null` and this degenerates
 * EXACTLY to federationShareDecision (zero behavior change, deny-by-default intact).
 * The BRIDGE and the MAP both stand already, and conflating their absence with the ring's absence
 * mis-sizes the work: `daemon:verify-request`/`-result` runs worker-side and the node vessel arms it for
 * its peer gate, while the worker's provider holds the docId→bagUrl map. What is missing sits between
 * them — no message carries that map across, and `verify-request` already takes a bagUrl, so it assumes
 * a caller who knows one while a sharePolicy shore holds only a documentId. One message, then the ring.
 *
 * Lighting it CLOSES A DOOR: a bag URL gets hashed to seed the Document it names, so a name that has
 * passed through a live ring costs a re-founding to change. Naming fusions resolve BEFORE, never after

 * ── THE SAFETY KEYSTONE (proven in cap-tier.test) ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Because `resolveTierForDoc` returns a tier ≤ the STRUCTURAL floor, and the base verdict already encodes
 * that floor, this layer can only ADD a deny — it is mechanically impossible for a declared datum to grant
 * a doc MORE openness than `carrierShareDecision` already permits. A bag that DECLARES itself PUBLIC but
 * whose structural floor is PERSONAGROUP resolves to PERSONAGROUP and never reaches a stranger.
 *
 * DEGENERATION (the read-lane-untouched proof): with `capTiers = null`, this returns EXACTLY
 * `carrierShareDecision(...)` — the tier layer adds tightening, it never widens the floor, and it stays
 * INERT until a bag actually carries the datum.
 *
 * ── HONEST BOUND (the not-yet-wired shore) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The `CapTierRing`'s `floor` oracle IS wired on the live path (it reads the SAME federatable-set + seal
 * oracles the carry-split consults — see cap-tier.ts `structuralFloorFor`). The `declared` source is the
 * SHORE not yet lit: no daemon recipe / BagTiddler carries a `capTier` datum in the tree TODAY, so a live
 * `declaredTierForDoc` returns null for every doc → the floor governs → zero behavior change. Lighting it
 * needs the recipe surface to seat the datum + a doc→bag resolver over the bag registry (the same bridge
 * `identityShareDecision`'s bound names). This fn is that shore's tested socket; it never fakes a verdict.
