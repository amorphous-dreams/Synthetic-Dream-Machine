/**
 * persona-scope — the per-group NAME of a PersonaGroup's private plane.
 *
 * ── THE PROBLEM ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `persona` names ONE PersonaGroup's private plane: its multitude, signer DID, KEL prefix, device
 * delegation. A human runs SEVERAL PersonaGroups across one set of devices — a work compartment and a play
 * compartment on the same laptop and the same phone — so one laptop needs one plane per group. A constant
 * bag id gives it one shelf where the model wants a family, and the second group has nowhere to stand.
 *
 * ── WHY A MAP WOULD HAVE BEEN THE WRONG ANSWER ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The obvious cure — one vessel-level index that lists a person's PersonaGroups and points each at its
 * plane — builds the thing canon forbids. The persona-circle ruling: a human's collection of compartments
 * is a private VAULT, and NOTHING stands above them that links them, because a layer above the vaults would
 * BE the Nymwars root. SDSI says the same from the naming side (RFC 2693; Stiegler): a petname system is a
 * NAMESPACE, not a super-key — a key placed over the compartments becomes a presentable root that
 * correlates them. So the answer must let a vessel FIND each plane without ever holding a thing that
 * ENUMERATES them.
 *
 * ── THE ANSWER, AND THE FOUR BLIND DOMAINS THAT ALREADY AGREE ON IT ─────────────────────────────
 * DERIVE the name from the group's OWN material, one-way, with nothing above it. Each PersonaGroup's
 * plane is named by a domain-separated MAC over that group's own doc id: hold the group, name its plane;
 * hold no group, name nothing. There is no root to present because there is no root.
 *
 * Four unrelated fields converged on this shape long before we met it:
 *   · HD wallets / Monero — one view secret RECOGNISES a thousand subaddresses that observers cannot
 *     join. Recognition without a published index.
 *   · anonymous credentials (Chaum 1985; Camenisch–Lysyanskaya 2001) — one master secret, per-verifier
 *     pseudonyms, and the verifiers cannot link them.
 *   · SDSI/petname naming (RFC 2693) — local names bind locally; no global name authority sits above.
 *   · group crypto (RFC 9420; Keyhive) — co-members cannot hide co-membership, so the same key MUST NOT
 *     appear in two groups. Canon's own words: "the deck stays one deck; the face it wears differs per
 *     handle, and no roster carries a key that appears on another."
 *
 * ── AND THE HOUSE ALREADY STOOD THE PRIMITIVE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `persona-identity.circleScopeIndex` does exactly this one level down: a domain-separated HMAC over a
 * circle's doc id yields a hardened index, so the same persona presents a DIFFERENT key to each circle it
 * joins. This module carries that convention up one level — from the KEY a persona presents to a circle, to
 * the NAME a PersonaGroup's own plane answers to. One convention, two levels, so neither invents a second law.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The tag hides nothing from someone who already holds the group's doc id — it is a NAME, not a secret,
 * and canon's single-bit test is about what gets PUBLISHED, not about what a holder can compute. What it
 * buys is that the name carries no vessel material: two PersonaGroups on one laptop produce two bag ids
 * with nothing of the laptop, and nothing of each other, inside either one.
 *
 * A peer may still ask a vessel whether it resolves a given bag, and a vessel that answers two probes has
 * told the asker it holds both compartments — canon's Janus interactive-receipt probe
 * (persona-circle#honest-scope). That surface rides the transport, not the name, and it stays named here
 * rather than quietly assumed away.
 *
 * ── WHAT A DERIVED NAME DOES AND DOES NOT REACH ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The persona TIDDLER paths (`SIGNER_DID_TIDDLER`, `PERSONA_SELVES_PREFIX`, the binding prefixes) keep
 * their `persona/...` spelling under any plane, and they keep resolving: a store answers a title by
 * looking it up verbatim in its own document, and the composite finds a title by WALKING its layers — a
 * layer's bag id labels the change events it emits, and namespaces nothing. So every plane's document
 * carries the same internal shape whatever its bag is called.
 *
 * What a bag id DOES reach is everything keyed by the bag itself: the composite's own layer lookups, the
 * `catalog` registry entry, the admit payload's read of that entry, and the capability check — which
 * resolves the bag URL verbatim and hashes it to seed the Keyhive Document. So a plane's name must stay
 * ONE string across all of those; `register-bags` carries which string a given plane answers to.

 * another's follows, and anything reading that document correlates the faces the multitude exists to hold
