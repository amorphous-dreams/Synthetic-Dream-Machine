/**
 * cap-compose — the composable-keel engine: a vessel = a #has-cap-stack (DECLARE) composed by a
 * transient capability-routing root (WIRE). Declare ⊥ wire, the same shore as INFRA⊥WHO / map⊥territory.
 *
 * The `#has-cap-stack` is an ECS declaration — a flat, dependency-blind set of cap-modules a vessel
 * HAS (what it *is*). It carries no edges (the retired-typed-edge ruling holds). Each cap-MODULE
 * declares the deps IT needs; `composeVessel` reads the stack and topologically WIRES the live
 * components — building each in dependency order, handing it a LEAST-AUTHORITY resolver that reaches
 * only its DECLARED deps (POLA / Genode default-deny / Granovetter "only connectivity begets
 * connectivity"). A missing mandatory dep or a cycle = the vessel REFUSES TO BOOT, loud — never a
 * runtime flag. The composer is transient: it builds the graph, then the boot extracts the few
 * entry-points it needs and drops broad authority (the powerbox guard — no god-object retained).
 *
 * So a Herm is not "a node with wiki=false" — it is a cap-stack that never declares the wiki cap, so
 * nothing routes to it: blind by structure, not by flag.
 *
 * Rhymes: ZLayer (provide-the-graph, topological, build-or-fail) · Genode `init` (capability-routing,
 * default-deny) · OSGi-DS (declared cardinality) · the ocap powerbox (transient broad authority).
