/**
 * sealed-box — the ONE X25519-ECDH → HKDF-SHA256 → XChaCha20-Poly1305 seal-to-a-recipient primitive.
 *
 * THE SUBTRACTION. Two protocols hand-rolled this same assembly independently: the persona-admit grant seal and the
 * keyring envelope. Their ECDH, their HKDF call shape and their AEAD ran byte-for-byte alike, differing only in what
 * they salted with and which domain they derived in. This module holds the assembly once; the DIFFERENCES that
 * carried meaning ride as required parameters, so composing here can never quietly erase them.
 *
 * THE DOMAIN RIDES REQUIRED AND UN-DEFAULTED (`info`). The HKDF `info` is what keeps a grant-seal key and a
 * keyring-seal key from deriving IDENTICALLY out of one ECDH output — and both protocols run between the same device
 * pair at admission time, so that separation carries real weight. A defaulted or optional `info` would invite a call
 * site to omit it and fuse two protocols' key material; this signature refuses to let that happen silently.
 *
 * THE SALT IS A SUPERSET, NEVER A REPLACEMENT. It binds `senderPub ‖ recipientPub` ALWAYS, then appends whatever
 * session challenges the caller carries. That strictly dominates both prior salts: the pubkey pair pins the
 * derivation to this exact pairing, and `extraSalt` pins it to this exact session (so a repeated ephemeral key still
 * derives a fresh key). Nothing a caller previously bound gets dropped.
 *
 * SEAL THROWS, OPEN WITHHOLDS. Sealing to a malformed recipient THROWS — a caller must never believe it delivered
 * something to nobody. Opening returns `null` on ANY failure (wrong key, tampered ciphertext, malformed frame) —
 * withhold, never forge, and never leak WHICH check failed.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT THE SEALED VALUE. A sealed value (`sealed-chunk`) seals under a symmetric content key a bag's readers
 * share, binds a bag, a key version, a role and a reference, and takes an address over its ciphertext. This
 * primitive seals to ONE recipient's public key under a fresh ephemeral and a fresh AEAD nonce, and binds a
 * protocol domain and a session. Both draw fresh randomness on every call (semantic security); they differ in who
 * may open and in what they bind, so neither stands in for the other and no flag folds them into one seal.
 *
 * BYTES IN, BYTES OUT. No hex, no base64url, no JSON — every carriage encoding stays caller-side, so the wire shapes
 * (`SealedGrant`, `KeyringEnvelope`) keep their own guards and never fuse.
