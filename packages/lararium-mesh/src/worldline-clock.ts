 *
 * LOCALITY: an agent/subagent's memories-of-work — handles,
 * edges, clocks — are a LOCAL causal island (the mempalace). They MUST NOT enter the
 * mesh/federation. So this clock rides a LOCAL `WorldlineLog`, never the mesh social
 * `SessionEventLog`.
 *
 * GRAIN: L0 Pulse = one generation SEGMENT (a `stop_reason` /
 * tool_use round — the OTel span, the finest durably-addressable unit); a content-block is a
 * sub-Pulse OFFSET (an index, not a tick — blocks in one inference share one emission instant).
 * The tick reads the HARNESS transcript's deterministic events, never the rendered grammar
 * (lose the HUD, keep the clock). Address = Theme.Arc.Measure.Beat.Segment[.block],
 * prefix-truncatable. Meme: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/mesh/ffz-clock#/rhythmic-address
