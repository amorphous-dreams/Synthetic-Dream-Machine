/**
 * deterministic-doc — per-Nexus doc addresses every island member computes ALIKE, so a shared board needs no
 * advertisement and no mint-race.
 *
 * The oracle plane already proves the shape (genesis-doc: oracleGenesisDocUrl derives an automerge: URL from
 * a well-known seed, so every vessel materializes the SAME doc under one stable id). The WHO plane reuses it:
 * a Nexus's crossroads doc and its WHO board each derive a deterministic URL from the nexus-pubkey, so two
 * browsers on one island resolve the identical board WITHOUT any node advertising its URL — and because the
 * board's id is a pure function of the nexus, no two vessels ever mint two competing boards (the pointer
 * write-back becomes idempotent: every vessel writes the same URL).
 *
 * Pure address derivation + a find-or-materialize helper. No key, no HTTP. The rare cross-version residual is
 * the same one the oracle doc carries (genesis-doc): a peer SYNCS an existing board far more often than it
 * re-materializes, and a blank board merges trivially.
