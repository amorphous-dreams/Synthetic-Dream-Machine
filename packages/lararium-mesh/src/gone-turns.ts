/**
 * gone-turns — the REWIND detector primitive (pure, dependency-free).
 *
 * The harvest index (`<state>/harvest/<wing>.ndjson`) is append-only, keyed by turn-uuid, with NO
 * gone-turn reconciliation: once a turn is recorded it stays, even if the operator later REWINDS the
 * transcript (an edited message, a branch abandoned) so that turn-uuid no longer appears. A turn the
 * index still holds but the current transcript no longer carries is a GONE turn — a rewind.
 *
 * Kapae (rewind = set-aside, never erase) closes the worldline edges keyed to a gone turn
 * (mempalace/worldline-kg `kapaeTurn`). This primitive only DETECTS; the caller scopes the comparison
 * (per-session, so a partial harvest never false-positives a session absent from the run) and fires
 * the close.
 *
 * ## The current-branch refinement
 *
 * The FORK-family transcript (Claude Code, Codex, Aider, Gemini, Copilot-CLI) ORPHANS-not-deletes: a
 * `/rewind` re-parents new turns off an earlier node, leaving the rewound tail in the `.jsonl` as an
 * orphaned branch. A FLAT file-read (every record) therefore finds NOTHING gone — the orphaned tail is
 * still physically present, so the naive `index − allRecords` set-diff misses every rewind. The cure:
 * reconstruct the CURRENT BRANCH (walk `parentUuid` from the live leaf back to the root) and diff the
 * index against THAT leaf-chain — the orphaned tail is off-branch, so it reads gone.
 *
 * Two non-rewinds MUST be filtered so kapae never fires on them:
 *   - SIDECHAINS (`isSidechain`) — worker-swarm sub-agent turns, kept separate, never main-branch.
 *   - STREAM-SPLITS — a branch point whose divergent children are DIFFERENT types (an assistant
 *     parent carrying both an `assistant` and a `user` child = the normal continue→reply flow, or a
 *     partial stream fragment). Only SAME-TYPE siblings sharing a parent = a real re-issue (the
 *     operator edited a user turn / regenerated an assistant turn).
 *
 * Meme: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/api/agent-worldline#/time (rewind = set-aside)

/**
 * The turn-uuids present in `prev` (the index) but absent from `current` (the live set) — the GONE
 * turns (rewound). Order follows first appearance in `prev`; duplicates and empties are dropped. SCOPE
 * is the caller's: pass the index-keys and the live-keys for ONE session, so a turn merely absent from
 * this harvest run (a different session) never reads as gone.
 *
 * The PURE set-diff floor — backward-compatible with the live kapae tail. The current-branch
 * refinement rides in the `current` set the caller passes ({@link liveKeysForRewind}): pass the
 * branch-live keys (orphans excluded) and this diff surfaces the rewound tail unchanged.
