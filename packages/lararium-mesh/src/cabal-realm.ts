/**
 * cabal-realm — the platform-blind mesh FLOOR for a CabalGroup modeled as a
 * virtual REALM: named-not-ruled (content-addressed), LIVED by its own
 * epoch-lease, DISSOLVED by cooling to anu when the members stop feeding it.
 *
 * Canon: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/cabal-realm — "a hearth beside, not a
 * category above." A group never holds you the way a container does (a noun, a
 * membership-list needing a root admitter); it runs as a thing you continuously DO
 * (a verb): members do not BELONG to the cabal, they MAINTAIN it. The relationships
 * define the realm, and it dissolves when they break.
 *
 * THIS MODULE COMPOSES EXISTING PRIMITIVES and mints none of its own:
 *   · epoch-lease.ts      — the realm's OWN liveness lease (coordinator-free
 *                           max-register), keyed by the realm's sentinel DocId.
 *   · bag-residency.ts    — the realm's substrate doc cools to anu when unfed;
 *                           feeding it (touch / hoʻowela) keeps it alive.
 * It builds the shore and NOTHING more. It does NOT call Keyhive, does NOT run
 * the found/join/evict CGKA ceremony, and does NOT bake any legitimacy answer.
 *
 * TWO-EPOCH DISTINCTION (canon #the-tie-break) — do not fuse these:
 *   · THIS lease (epoch-lease)  — LIVENESS. The collective-maintenance
 *                                 heartbeat: rolls forward on churn, heals
 *                                 honest re-key, guards no authority.
 *   · Keyhive CGKA / BeeKEM re-key — the AUTHORITY tie-break (concurrent
 *                                 add-while-remove, remove-wins by
 *                                 blank-on-merge). NOT here — that rides the
 *                                 Keyhive membership graph, which stays gated on
 *                                 the operator's forks. Malice rides Plane-B
 *                                 convergent-removal, also not here.
 *
 * THE UNSWEPT CORNER (canon #the-unswept-corner) — persistence ≠ legitimacy.
 * Soft-state rewards whoever keeps feeding, NOT who legitimately holds the
 * realm; a small hostile faction can out-maintain an apathetic majority. The
 * cure (a quorum-of-vouchers / fork-and-leave) stays the operator's OPEN shore.
 * The join shore below stays INERT by design — it bakes no legitimacy signal.
 *
 * Platform-blind: rides ./epoch-lease + ./bag-residency only. NO node: imports.

 * admission fence — it bounds outstanding invites, and rolling it stales every one at once, so it
 * belongs to the vessel that admits. This addresses the REALM'S feed, the heartbeat its members keep
 * together, which has to take a peer's write. They share a key BY CONSTRUCTION, not by debt: a cabal IS
 * the shared relation over its realm's resources, so identity-as-relation names it by that realm's doc.
 * One name is correct; one SLOT was not.
 *
 * Addressed alike they are ONE SLOT, and each drives the other: feeding a realm stales its own invites,
 * and revoking an invite reads as somebody maintaining it.
 *
 * Both fold by MAX and neither verifies a seal before folding, so one slot carrying a large number is
 * enough to stale a resource. A shared board carrying both senses would hand any peer that reach. These
 * slots therefore carry no daemon root — they are relative to whichever board holds them, and no fence
 * scan reaches them.

/**
 * The realm's liveness, read FROM the residency temperature of its substrate:

 *                                    (#the-realm DISSOLVED-by-cooling), and scoped bilaterally:
 *                                    `carry-contract` reads it "you are out, BETWEEN US".
 *   · anu, RECLAIMED
 *            or cause unknown → "unread" — this vessel took the memory back and holds no reading.
 *                                    An LRU trim fires the moment residents pass `hotCap`, and an
 *                                    evict request arrives from the daemon; both are blind to how
 *                                    well the realm is fed. Reporting either as a dissolution
 *                                    answers a question about a polity with a resource decision.
 *   · no reading    → "unread"     — THIS vessel has not synced the substrate.
 *
 * ── WHY ABSENCE TAKES ITS OWN STATE ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * Temperature is a fact about a PLACE — whether a bag stands loaded in this vessel's
 * memory. Liveness is a fact about a PRINCIPAL — whether a polity still stands. Reading
 * the second off the first is legitimate only where the vessel HAS a reading; where it
 * has none, "I never fetched it" and "it ended" generate identically under no-global-now,
 * and defaulting the gap to cold answers a question about a polity with a fact about a
 * cache (canon: one-name-one-relation#one-vocabulary-four-axes).
 *
 * So absence rides as its own state rather than as a default, and it names the VESSEL's
 * condition rather than the realm's: `unread` says this replica has not seen it. A caller
 * that must have a verdict decides what to do with that; nothing here decides for them.
 *
 * "cooling" rides the type as the future intermediate, since the residency engine exposes
 * only the two settled states through its public surface (the `warm` middle tier never
 * landed, and the transient `evicting` flag stays private to BagStowage). A higher layer
 * that can observe an in-flight cool may report it.

 *
 * ── WARMTH IS EVIDENCE; COLD IS ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A realm is a COLLECTIVE BOUND BY INTERACTION — group identity carried as relations, with several
 * realms living inside one Nexus. Residency temperature cannot see a collective: every warming act
 * is LOCAL (`feedCabalRealm`, wiki activation, composite-store), and replication is not wired to
 * residency at all. A remote face feeding this realm never warms this replica.
 *
 * So the two directions carry different weight, and this reading is asymmetric on purpose:
 *   · `alive`     — this vessel holds a synced substrate it is actively working. Weak evidence, but
 *                   evidence: something stands here to interact with.
 *   · `dissolved` — this vessel stopped feeding it. `carry-contract` scopes that bilaterally — "you
 *                   are out, BETWEEN US" — so it reports a DEPARTURE, never an ending. The collective
 *                   may be humming without this replica, and other meshes stand out of view.
 *   · `unread`    — this vessel never looked.
 *
 * ⚠ NO INSTRUMENT HERE SEES THE COLLECTIVE, and `realmStanding` does not either. Its per-writer lease
 * slots ride `bags/daemon/lease-epoch/`, whose bag URL each vessel reads off its OWN social bootstrap,
 * so a contracted peer's offering never arrives — measured on two hearths through a live relay, where
 * the founder counted her own faces and never her partner's. Both readings answer for the vessel
 * holding them; they differ in WHAT they answer about, never in how far they see.
