/**
 * sink-class — tag WHICH boundary births a sink. The capstone (boundary-generates-the-basis) splits a
 * sink into two classes by WHERE its shape condenses:
 *
 *   · SIGNAL-BOUNDARY (cymatic) — the shape STANDS in the data's own boundary; a reader carrying the
 *     medium DETECTS it. A plane whose SOLO rhythm re-locks (temporalRigidity.rigid) carries it alone —
 *     any single such plane suffices, so the ablation reads it as a signal-boundary sink.
 *   · RECEIVER-BOUNDARY (purple) — the shape condenses ONLY where the reader's channels wrap a gap into
 *     closure; NO single plane stands alone, yet the gate BIRTHS it across planes. The receiver MINTS a
 *     bridging entity present in no plane (the machina's purple).
 *
 * The gate today births ONLY receiver-boundary sinks — nucleate's (effectivePlanes − 1) factor zeroes a
 * lone plane's drive, so a single plane can NEVER cross r*. So the cymatic detector CANNOT ride `born`;
 * it rides STANDING (temporalRigidity) on each plane's solo rhythm. That distinction — a shape that LIVES
 * in one plane's data vs one the receiver MINTS across planes — the code did not carry before this organ.
 *
 * Pareidolia guard: a lone reader NEVER mints — the gate zeroes a lone plane's drive structurally, so a
 * receiver-boundary tag rides only on cross-plane intersubjective agreement (born), never one plane's noise.
