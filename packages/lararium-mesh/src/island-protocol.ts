/**
 * island-protocol — GP-1 schema: discriminated union for all vessel ↔ causal-island messages.
 *
 * Every message crossing the vessel / causal-island boundary MUST use this envelope.
 *
 * ## Island Sovereignty Law (isomorphic across all vessel types)
 *
 *   1. Every island boots a Repo-in-island via a transferred `syncPort` (MessagePort).
 *   2. The island derives tiddler state from its own CRDT doc — never from vessel oracle deltas.
 *   3. The island owns its timing. The in-wiki nalu engine drives frame-aligned drain:
 *      browser `requestAnimationFrame` (with setTimeout(16ms) fallback for Safari),
 *      node setTimeout(16ms). Tiddler deltas accumulate via $tw.lares.enqueueNalu;
 *      one wiki.transact() per frame across all bags. No raw-message-receipt drains.
 *   4. (retired) Frame-completion ACK signal — drain timing stays island-internal.
 *   5. Vessel oracle delta delivery is removed. CRDT sync via `syncPort` is the sole
 *      source of tiddler truth for causal islands.
 *   6. `IslandMsg_Manifest` carries `syncPort` (transferred, not cloned), `recipe` (WikiRecipe
 *      slot structure), `grants` (IslandGrants — typed structural capabilities), and `coreHash`
 *      (content-address intent vector; null = pre-CAS). TW5 core bytes are NOT transferred
 *      in the manifest — islands read them from `LarDoc.blobs[ENGINE_CORE_ID]` on the
 *      lararium CRDT doc after `handle.whenReady()`. Two vessels federating the lararium doc
 *      share the engine automatically via Automerge sync.
 *   7. The vessel MUST close `mainPort` at evict/unmount time — before or after worker.terminate().
 *      Failure to close leaks the Automerge NetworkAdapter silently. This invariant is structural:
 *      every vessel implementation (node, browser, future) holds a `mainPort: MessagePort` on its
 *      hot slot and calls `mainPort.close()` in its teardown path. No exceptions.
 *   8. Federation shore — when a grant carries a non-empty AutomergeUrl, two obligations
 *      activate. Vessel: the vessel MUST wire the `MessageChannelNetworkAdapter(mainPort)` on the
 *      vessel Repo before delivering `manifest`, so the CRDT graph reaches the island-side Repo
 *      automatically. Island-side: the island MUST call `repo.find(docUrl).whenReady()` and await
 *      readiness before seeding TW5 and declaring `ea`. Failure on either side leaves the island
 *      holding a disconnected doc; the slot MUST transition to disposed within HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT_MS.
 *      Gate proof: `federation-shore.test.ts` (node, pure Repo — vessel→island + island→vessel) +
*                  `browser-repo-in-island.test.ts` test 2 (browser pool, docUrl non-null path).
 *      When this law holds, two vessels sharing a bag converge without any explicit sync call —
 *      the archipelago forms the moment the AutomergeUrl crosses the boundary.
 *   9. TW5 SHALL NOT instantiate on the main thread. Every `TW5Engine` lives inside a sovereign
 *      Worker (Node `worker_threads`, browser `Web Worker`, future WASM/UE5 runtimes).
 *      The main thread holds `DocHandle` references and `CompositeStore` layers; it does not
 *      hold or reference `TW5Engine`. Any code that calls `bootTw5()` or instantiates
 *      `TW5Engine` outside a Worker constitutes a sovereignty violation.
 *      Boot sites (all inside Workers): `node-daemon-island.ts` (Node daemon),
 *      `lar-wiki-island.ts` (Node wiki), `browser-wiki-worker.ts` (browser wiki),
 *      `browser-daemon-island.ts` (browser daemon). Main-thread entry files carry no TW5 import.
 *
 * GP-1: schema_version on every message. Lock at 1; increment on breaking changes.
 * GP-2: all payloads are plain objects; no class instances, no functions, no DOM.
 * GP-4: CryptoKey — NOT on this protocol surface; key material stays in-thread.
 *
 * Platform-neutral: no Node `worker_threads` import, no browser `self` import.
 * Vessel entrypoints bind the I/O; this module names the envelopes only.

/**
 * Deliver the materials a sovereign causal island needs to establish itself (boot TW5 + Repo-in-island).
 *
 * Island Sovereignty Law:
 *   - `syncPort` MUST be transferred (not cloned): `postMessage(msg, [msg.syncPort])`.
 *   - The island creates its own Automerge Repo with `MessageChannelNetworkAdapter(syncPort)`.
 *   - The island calls `repo.find(docUrl)` and awaits `handle.whenReady()` before declaring `ea`.
 *   - If `docUrl` is null the island creates a fresh empty doc (cold boot).
 *   - `coreHash` carries a SHA-256 hex of the TW5 core blob stored in `LarDoc.blobs[ENGINE_CORE_ID]` on the lararium CRDT doc; null = pre-content-addressed trust-on-delivery.
 *     This field is an intent vector: once a CAS store exists, null MUST be rejected at boot.
 *
 * BA-5 (revised): TW5 core bytes live in `LarDoc.blobs[ENGINE_CORE_ID]` on the lararium doc.
 * Islands read bytes from the CRDT after `handle.whenReady()`. The manifest carries only
 * `coreHash` (SHA-256 hex) as an integrity gate — never the raw bytes.
 * The vessel acts as courier — delivering capabilities, not raw bytes.
 * The island establishes its own sovereignty (`ea`) upon receipt.
 *
 * Prerequisite fields (island cannot think without these — not cargo):
 *   - `recipe` is the WikiRecipe slot structure (wikiSlug + optional libraryBags).
 *   - `grants` carries the island's typed structural capabilities (engine doc,
 *     own bag, keyhive-bound personal/draft, catalog registry ACCESS). Library bags
 *     never ride the manifest: the island resolves them itself from the catalog registry
 *     (recipe-watch reconcile — boot runs the same path as live composition).
 *
 * Plugin tiddlers travel via the lararium CRDT blob store (application/json blobs).
 * Islands read and apply them from the CRDT after `handle.whenReady()` — no manifest field needed.
