/**
 * handle-card — a self-certifying published FACE, recognised by its own key, never by a registry.
 *
 * PUBLISH A FACE, NEVER A SELF. A human keeps many unlinkable handles in a private vault (persona-circle
 * #the-vault); a HANDLE-CARD is what ONE handle shows the world so others can recognise it again. It carries
 * the handle's public key, a display glamour, and pointers to where its standing lives — and NOTHING that
 * reaches the vault or the human's other faces. Publishing Guru-Josh's card reveals nothing about Telarus-KSC,
 * because they share no key and the collector that knows they are one human is never published.
 *
 * RECOGNITION IS SELF-CERTIFYING. The card is signed by the handle's OWN key, and that key rides IN the card
 * (`nym`). So a recogniser verifies the signature against the embedded key and needs no directory to trust —
 * the name contains the key (Mazières' self-certifying names; did:key; a Nostr npub). Zooko's triangle
 * resolves: the identifier is secure-and-decentralised because it IS the key, and memorable because each
 * recogniser keeps a LOCAL petname for it. There is no SIN, and no global registry to capture.
 *
 * MONOTONE, LEASED, LINEAGE-LINKED — the same discipline `oracle-substrate` proved. A card carries a
 * monotone `version` (a stale card cannot roll a fresh one back), a `prev` link (the recogniser can follow
 * one face's history), and an `expiry` (a lease read against the LOCAL clock — an unfed card goes stale on
 * its own, since a negative fact cannot be made to arrive). The identity of a card is its CONTENT, never its
 * signature: re-signing the same face with a fresh expiry keeps the same lineage across heartbeats.
 *
 * Pure and isomorphic, like oracle-substrate: this module holds no I/O and no key. The vessel supplies the
 * signer; the caller carries the bytes; the read-open oracle plane serves the published blob.
 *
 * Design-of-record: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/persona-circle#the-vault (publication model).
