/**
 * cabal-realm-clock — the CAPTURE-CLOCK: make a realm's maintenance VISIBLE, so the
 * majority can SEE a minority out-feeding it WHILE it happens (while exit is still
 * cheap). A pure, verdict-free read over the realm's lease slots.
 *
 * The persistence ≠
 * legitimacy gap is a HARD-BOUND — legitimacy cannot live in the join-gate without the
 * gate becoming the captured object, so the gate STAYS INERT. The buildable answer is
 * not prevention but ESCAPE (fork-as-exit) + SIGHT. This module is the SIGHT half: it
 * instruments who feeds the realm and how hard (free — it reads the liveness signal the
 * epoch-lease already keeps), turning Hirschman's failure case (silent capture under
 * apathy) into a readable surface (canon: api/pono/cabal-realm#the-unswept-corner).
 *
 * THE BOUNDARY — this clock SURFACES, it never JUDGES. It reports per-maintainer
 * standing + the spread + the leading-set concentration as raw numbers; it emits NO
 * "captured" verdict and holds NO threshold. WHAT spread or concentration counts as
 * capture is the operator's calibration — the legitimacy call cannot be mechanized
 * without recreating a root. The lens is here; the reading stays
 * the operator's seat (OPEN).
 *
 * What it can and cannot see: the lease is a coordinator-free MAX-REGISTER (current
 * epoch per writer, no history), so this reads a STANDING at a point in time — who
 * maintains + how deep each has rolled — not a time-series. Capture shows as a small
 * leading set far ahead of a trailing majority; repeated reads let the operator watch
 * the trend. A richer fed-since-when history stands unbuilt.
 *
 * Platform-blind: rides ./epoch-lease + ./cabal-realm only. NO node: imports.
 *
