/**
 * carrier-type — the media type a `.mem` carries, declared once.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS COLLAPSES AND THE PATTERNS AROUND IT DO NOT ────────────────────────────────────────
 * Four mechanisms dispatch on this string, each a different one: the TW5 parser module exports under
 * it, the deserializer module exports under it, `registerFileType` binds an extension to it, and a
 * record's stored `type` field is compared against it. A fifth reads it back off disk from a carrier's
 * own meta block.
 *
 * They agree only by hand. Spelled five ways, a change lands in four of them and the fifth refuses
 * quietly — a record whose type does not match simply stops projecting, with no throw and no
 * diagnostic. So the STRINGS collapse here; each mechanism keeps its own binding.
 *
 * ── ONE SPELLING, EVERYWHERE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `+tiddlywiki` is an RFC 6839 structured syntax suffix: it states that this syntax is BUILT ON TW5
 * wikitext, in the form a media-type registry already understands. The registration-track name —
 * no `x-`, RFC 6838 deprecates that prefix — is the one spelling read and written.
 *
 * A `type` outside CARRIER_TYPES surfaces as an unadmitted type, loudly, and the record does not
 * project — the correct fate for a spelling this grammar does not mint. Admitting near-misses would
 * trade that loud surface for a silent guess about what the author meant.
