/**
 * cas-transit — the REMOTE leg of `cad` resolution: a member FETCHES a sealed ciphertext body it does not hold
 * locally, across the mesh, and VERIFIES it secret-free before it ever returns.
 *
 * THE SHAPE (modeled, not libp2p). A minimal Bitswap-style exchange over our OWN member↔relay transport — the
 * five messages, no dependency pulled: `want-have` / `have` / `dont-have` (discovery) and `want-block` / `block`
 * (fetch). A member broadcasts `want-have(cid)` to its session peers + the bag-tracker relay; holders answer
 * `have`, the rest `dont-have`; the member then `want-block`s a holder and receives the ciphertext `block`.
 *
 * DHT-FREE DISCOVERY (canon: hint → peers → bag-tracker). Discovery rides the EXISTING member↔relay connections
 * plus the relay's bag-tracker index (`cid → holders`) — NEVER a global DHT. Stock Bitswap falls to a DHT when no
 * session peer answers; HERE the bag-tracker IS that fallback authority, so the path stays inside the Nexus causal
 * island. A DHT, if ever added, sits BEHIND an `oracle`-plane rendezvous (its own causal-island boundary) — never this
 * path.
 *
 * SECRET-FREE VERIFY (verify-cap ⊥ read-cap). The relay serving the block AND the fetcher receiving it BOTH run
 * `verifyCiphertextCid(bytes, cid)` — `BLAKE3(bytes) == cid`, holding NO key, NO per-Nexus secret, NO read-cap.
 * The cid IS the integrity check (no auth tag — an immutable content-address). A tampered byte fails the recompute
 * at both ends. Only AFTER verify does the member decrypt with the read-cap it holds on the private keyhive lane —
 * the transit layer carries ciphertext and reads nothing.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED: bytes failing `BLAKE3(bytes) == cid` are REJECTED — never cached, never returned (a corrupt/hostile
 * relay cannot poison the local CAS). `dont-have` from every peer + the tracker resolves to `null` (an explicit
 * miss) — never a partial or unverified body. The relay holds only ciphertext + cid, so it cannot leak plaintext.
 *
 * DEFERRED (follow-on): the bao/BLAKE3 outboard tree for INCREMENTAL / range verification (Iroh's model — verify a
 * sub-range without the whole blob). Whole-blob `verifyCiphertextCid` is correct and sufficient today; bao is the
 * streaming upgrade, wire-compatible, and lands when large-body range-fetch needs it.
