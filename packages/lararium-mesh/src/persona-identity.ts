/**
 * persona-identity — the persona master-seed lifecycle + the two-key atom.
 *
 * Doctrine (canon: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/persona-circle, #the-atom +
 * #composition):
 *
 *   The base atom carries TWO keys, a real two-axis substrate ≠ sovereignty:
 *     · vessel-key       — the device/substrate identity. DEVICE-MINTED on its
 *                          own device, the private half never leaving
 *                          (vessel-identity-core). It is NEVER derived from the
 *                          persona seed — deriving it would collapse the two
 *                          into the copy-the-key antipattern that dissolves
 *                          per-device revocation (Veilid/SSB).
 *     · veiled-user-key  — the sovereign pseudonym presented through the veil.
 *                          The persona side: it AND the whole persona
 *                          constellation derive from ONE seed via ed25519
 *                          HD-derivation, all-hardened paths (persona-hd,
 *                          SLIP-0010 — structurally immune to the xpub-linkage
 *                          trap). Recover the seed → re-derive the constellation.
 *
 * This file carries the persona TREE: the path convention, the veiled-user-key
 * derivation, and the per-circle scope-pseudonym that extends it one level.
 *
 * RETIRED FROM HERE, and where each went:
 *   · the seed LIFECYCLE  → `persona-vault` holds the live root machinery.
 *   · the two-key ATOM    → `dyad` holds it, and holds it as a RELATION rather than
 *     as a struct of two public keys. That difference carries the ruling: identity
 *     ENACTS a relationship, so the pair was never the thing — the hold between them was.
 *
 * Platform-blind: rides ./persona-hd + ./crypto only. NO node: imports. The
 * randomness arrives through an injected `randomBytes` shore (platform supplies
 * globalThis.crypto.getRandomValues) — NEVER a hardcoded crypto source.
 *
 * DEFER (a later cut — NOT built here): advanced seed CUSTODY + RECOVERY (DKMS,
 * social/trustee recovery, rotation-under-unlinkability). This cut carries the
 * basic lifecycle + derivation + atom assembly only.

/**
 * nexusScopeIndex — the per-ISLAND hardened index for a Nexus scope leaf.
 *
 * Canon states the shape: "the name DERIVES from the compartment's own material. Each plane answers to
 * a domain-separated MAC over that PersonaGroup's own doc id." An island carries its own material —
 * the genesis epoch AID, content-addressed over the seated key-set and threshold — so a leaf derives
 * from that and from nothing a vessel owns.
 *
 * SEPARATE FROM `circleScopeIndex` BY DOMAIN, and deliberately. A circle names a human's own
 * compartment; a Nexus names an island several operators share. One MAC domain across both would let a
 * leaf derived for a compartment collide with a leaf derived for an island — the collision the two
 * levels stay apart to forbid.
 *
 * Same island → same index → same leaf, so a face rejoining an island presents the key it presented
 * before. Different islands → different leaves, so an observer reading two islands finds no shared key.
 * The 31-bit space bounds a human's own islands far below a birthday concern, and a collision would
 * link only two of ONE human's own islands — a floor-tier leak rather than a break.
 *
 * IT NORMALISES CASE WHERE `circleScopeIndex` DOES NOT, and the difference follows the material rather
 * than an inconsistency. An AID carries hex, where two spellings name one value, so folding case keeps
 * one island from deriving two leaves. A circle answers to a doc id in base58, where case CARRIES —
 * two spellings name two documents — and folding it there would merge distinct circles.
