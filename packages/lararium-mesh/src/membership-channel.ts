/**
 * membership-channel — the shore the WHO-plane ceremony crosses (the Herm's OPEN ceremony transport).
 *
 * The membership ceremony (contact-card exchange · join-request · admit · invite) is
 * bidirectional; the transport under it is swappable. This interface is the trunk both live impls ride:
 *   · Impl-1 — file/POST (FileMembershipChannel, node-side): the Herm's ceremony carriage over a shared dir.
 *   · Impl-2 — live-WS (over lar-ws-client-adapter): the same carriage over live sockets, behind THIS SAME
 *     interface — chosen by deployment, not a migration. The shore is why either transport costs nothing above it.
 *
 * The channel carries OPAQUE ceremony envelopes — it never interprets the payload (a
 * contact card, an admit payload, an invite token). Routing only: address vessel→vessel
 * (or broadcast to a place), deliver-once per recipient.
 *
 * Platform-blind: no node: imports. The in-memory impl here is the reference + the unit
 * substrate; the file/WS impls live node-side behind this interface.
