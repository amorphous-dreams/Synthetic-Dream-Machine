/**
 * worldline-causal — the worldline's CAUSAL partial-order, an in-memory ITC registry keyed on
 * (handle × FRONTIER). SEPARATE from the rhythmic clocks (worldline-clock.ts) by the PATH-B cut:
 * causal rides ITC / the edge-DAG, the FfzClock stays purely rhythmic.
 *
 * Happened-before projects from the spawn/inject/handback structure, so the order is
 * concurrent-capable: siblings of one spawn with no join between them read "concurrent"
 * (agent-worldline #time, #attribution). Keyed turn-DAG (the operator's C-cut) — handles
 * survive rewind/fork because the turn-DAG node does.
 *
 * ## The (handle, frontier) address (slice-3)
 *
 * The registry key is `${handle}@${frontier}` — address = handle × FRONTIER, the frontier keyed
 * BY the handle, never smuggled INSIDE it. The handle stays a RIGID designator (baptized-fixed at
 * spawn); the frontier is the MOVING antichain — a short hash of the ITC event heads (the causal
 * history), so it advances on every inject/handback and holds across a bare fork. This fixes the
 * same-session-fork collision: two spawns of one child handle across a rewind carry DIFFERENT
 * re-projected histories → different frontiers → distinct keys, so `worldlineSpawn` no longer
 * throws when a handle re-appears on a rewound-then-re-forked branch. The frontier is DERIVED from
 * the stamp — never authoritative state, so the composite key holds only because causal-order rides
 * a re-derivable projection (else the global-now sneaks back in).
 *
 * NOTE — the edge-DAG home LANDED (slice-2): the same spawn/inject/handback persist as
 * mempalace-KG triples (prov:Delegation + prov:Communication via kg_add / `kg_io.py`), and
 * kapae (rewind) closes them via kg_invalidate (valid_to set, never deleted). This in-memory
 * ITC registry stays the live causal READ; the persisted edge-DAG is the durable home, and the
 * ITC verdict re-projects from those triples via worldline-trajectory's worldlineCausalFromEdges.
 *
