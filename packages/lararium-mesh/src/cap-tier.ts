/**
 * cap-tier — the bag's sharing-posture as SELF-DESCRIBING DATA (operator-ruled 2026-07-21).
 *
 * A bag's cap-tier answers ONE question — WHO holds the read-cap — as a CHAIN by set-inclusion:
 *
 *     VEIL{this-vessel} ⊂ PERSONAGROUP{your-fleet} ⊂ CONTRACT{your-fleet ∪ a-cabal} ⊂ PUBLIC{world}
 *
 * Sealing-on-the-wire stays UNIVERSAL (everything leaving a vessel travels ciphertext); cleartext
 * lives ONLY inside a vessel (VEIL) or is world-readable (PUBLIC). PERSONAGROUP and CONTRACT ride
 * the SAME mechanism — keyring-delivery to a recipient set — differing only in WHICH set.
 *
 * ── ISOMORPHIC TO FederationPosture (by composition, not interface) ──────────────────────────────
 * `FederationPosture` (federation-gate.ts) models a per-Nexus stance as a self-describing datum: a
 * closed string union, a `DEFAULT_…` fail-closed constant, a `…FromDoc` parser that fail-closes on a
 * torn value, and a pure fold (`answersStrangers`) that reads it. This module models the
 * cap-tier the SAME way — a closed union, `DEFAULT_CAP_TIER = "veil"` (fail-closed), `parseCapTier`
 * that fail-closes any torn value to VEIL, and a pure `resolveTier` gate. The tier only carries MORE
 * structure than a posture: a TOTAL ORDER + a `meet` (a posture is a two-valued special case).
 *
 * ── THE SAFETY KEYSTONE (the load-bearing invariant) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The declared datum only DECLARES; the GATE ENFORCES `declared ∧ structural-floor` — the meet toward
 * the MORE-restrictive tier. A self-describing datum can therefore only ever self-TIGHTEN: it is
 * MECHANICALLY impossible for the quine to grant MORE openness than the crypto floor allows, because
 * `resolveTier` NEVER returns a tier more-open than its `structuralFloor` argument. The gate never
 * trusts the declared datum to loosen.
