/**
 * ffz-project — the `lar_ffz` rhythmic address as a NESTED-MEMBERSHIP CONTAINMENT PATH.
 *
 * `lar_ffz` names WHERE a drawer's rhythm sits in a rooted membership tree — it is NOT
 * a projection of wall-time and NOT a clock. The FFZ tree is a meet-semilattice: each
 * band is a containment layer (coarse→fine), an address is a node, and the "distance
 * between two drawers' rhythms" is the co-depth of their lowest common ancestor — the
 * length of their longest common prefix (an ULTRAMETRIC, order-free).
 *
 * The five bands (coarse→fine, FFZ_ADDRESS_ORDER):
 *   - Theme   — thread cluster        (ARC-CLOSE trigger + MDL guard BUILT; the
 *               community-detection compute — igraph/leiden — stays deferred)
 *   - Arc     — the session = source_file (the session-island; given FREE)
 *   - Measure — topic-shift           (SERVO-DRIVEN — the Schmitt-trigger quorum gong)
 *   - Beat    — the turn (a grounding act, per-island; null-graceful where no clean
 *               turn label exists at the call site)
 *   - Pulse   — the drawer / inscription atom (the finest cell)
 *
 * Each segment is a MEMBERSHIP LABEL (a cell id), never a modular phase — so there is
 * NO bound, NO modulo, NO cycling here. The prior wall-time anchor ({capturedTime,
 * sessionPosition}) is REJECTED as un-pono (it imputed a global now); this module reads
 * only the containment labels a drawer already holds.
 *
 * RHYTHM-ONLY (the PATH-B cut): `lar_ffz` carries ZERO causality. Co-depth paces the
 * grain (how near two rhythms sit); it never orders history — causal order rides the
 * edge-DAG / itcCompare (itc.ts) / worldlineCompare (worldline-causal.ts), which this
 * module does NOT touch.
 *
 * Address shape — `"<profile>/<Theme>.<Arc>.<Measure>.<Beat>.<Pulse>"`, ordered
 * COARSE→FINE so a coarser read drops trailing bands cleanly (prefix-truncatable; see
 * {@link ffzTruncate}). An absent/fluid cell renders as the sentinel {@link FFZ_ABSENT}
 * (`_` — presence-of-the-band acknowledged, the cell unclaimed); trailing absent cells
 * are omitted entirely. A partial address still addresses.

// MEASURE (multivariate) — the THREE-PLANE quorum-servo (a Schmitt-trigger gong
// fused over content · form · structure plane-drifts).
//
// The one servo above reads a SINGLE plane (content cohesion). The Measure gong
// the schema actually wants fuses THREE plane-drifts into one wavefront. The
// load-bearing warning: the planes are NOT independent — form co-moves with
// content — so a naive max-OR or additive pool DOUBLE-COUNTS a single shift that
// shows on two planes. The quorum-servo guards against that in four moves:
//
//   1. COMMON CURRENCY — each plane's raw drift (arbitrary scale) is standardized
//      to a unit-free EWMA-z against its OWN running baseline (the FAST loop of the
//      one servo, generalized to N named planes). Raw-scale differences cannot leak:
//      a plane drifting in 0..0.01 and one in 0..1000 read the same z for the same
//      relative spike.
//   2. WHITEN — the standardized z-vector is decorrelated by a running EWMA estimate
//      of its cross-plane correlation (≈ corr matrix, since z is ~unit-variance),
//      via a ZCA (symmetric) inverse-sqrt transform {@link symInvSqrt}. A content+form
//      co-move that is really ONE shift collapses along the high-variance correlated
//      axis, so the joint surprise (Σ wₚ²) counts it ONCE, not twice.
//      SIMPLIFICATION FLAG: a RIDGE term (cfg.ridge, default 0.05) regularizes the
//      correlation matrix before inversion — the lightest honest guard against the
//      near-singular block a perfectly-correlated pair produces. This is the full
//      online-covariance whitening (N is tiny: 3), not the correlation-discount
//      fallback; the only simplification is the fixed ridge (a per-eigenvalue floor
//      could replace it, deferred).
//   3. SPARSIFIED FUSION (threshold-then-sum, Cho-Fryzlewicz; never max-OR) — each
//      plane clears its OWN noise-gate (cfg.gate, on the unit-variance whitened
//      scale) before contributing. Survivors pool MULTIPLICATIVELY as a log-opinion
//      pool / shared-hazard factorized Gaussian likelihood: the fused log-evidence
//      is Σ rₚ·(±wₚ²) — super-additive on agreement (squares add), self-vetoing on
//      conflict (a plane that strongly DENIES a boundary, wₚ < −vetoGate, SUBTRACTS,
//      driving the multiplicative likelihood toward a near-zero factor).
//   4. CONFIDENCE LADDER + CO-FIRING WINDOW — planes that fire within a co-firing
//      window (cfg.coFireWindow steps) are counted: 1 plane = provisional · 2 = firm ·
//      3 coincident = the gong. Reuses the one servo's Schmitt arming + FLOOR/CEIL/MDL.
//   5. CONFLICT GUARD (Signal-Jam) — one plane screaming with the others silent (or a
//      live positive/negative disagreement) flags `conflict` and NEVER fires the gong;
//      per-plane reliabilities precision-weight the pool so a low-SNR plane cannot
//      manufacture confidence on its own.
//
// PURE: like the one servo, every function returns fresh state and mutates nothing.
// This is the FUSION math over GIVEN per-plane drifts — the live 3-plane vector feed
// (content embeddings · form/structure signals) rides the node-side orchestrator
// (mempalace `ffz-orchestrator`), BUILT and tested; it runs live as a daemon verb

 * baselines AND the cross-plane correlation EWMA, so the road-not-taken (a rewound/forked
