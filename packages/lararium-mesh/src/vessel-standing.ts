/**
 * vessel-standing — HOW a vessel comes to stand, and how many faces it may hold.
 *
 * Two questions one model answers, because they turn out to be the same question asked twice: a vessel that
 * may hold no human face also cannot self-sign its own founding, and a vessel that self-signs its founding
 * necessarily holds one.
 *
 * ── THE TWO FOUNDING MODES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * SELF-STOOD — the vessel MINTS a persona root and signs its own device-delegation with it. A human's own
 * hearth or leaf: they stand present, they hold their own face, they bind their own device.
 *
 * CONTRACTED — the vessel mints NO root. A trusted operator, already contracted with the kahu, signs the
 * device-delegation ELSEWHERE and the vessel carries only the EDGE. This enacts bind-by-edge in its purest case:
 * such a vessel cannot cheat by holding a seed, because it never holds one.
 *
 * A Herm stands CONTRACTED, always, and that holds as law rather than as setting. A crossroads holds no local
 * human keys to steal — so its legitimacy runs kahu quorum → the operator's carriage contract → the
 * operator's persona root signing its edge, and it holds a Place DID and nothing of anybody's person.
 *
 * ── WHY THE SLOT CEILING IS PART OF THE SAME ANSWER ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The Herm's ceiling reads 0 STRUCTURALLY: no dial raises it, because raising it would put a human's key on
 * a crossroads, the one thing the class exists to prevent. Every other class carries an operator
 * DIAL — a human holds a multitude, and the code has no business deciding how large a multitude may be.
 *
 * The default bounds a device that has not been told otherwise; it bounds OPERATION (each root
 * implies a vault slot, a KEL, and sync traffic), never a legitimacy signal, so unlike the admission dials
 * it may safely carry one. Raising it rides an operator turn; it can never raise a Herm.
 *
 * Platform-blind: rides ./persona-vault's index ceiling only. NO node: imports.
 * Meme: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/mesh/identity-classes

 *
 * Every other class reads the operator's declared ceiling, or the default when they have declared none. A
 * torn or nonsensical declaration falls back to the default rather than to zero: a mis-typed config must not
 * silently lock a human out of their own faces (that failure grants no safety, it locks a human out).

// ── THE WAKING FLOOR — one floor, and caps that arrive by recognition ──────────────────────────────────

/**
 * standAs — every vessel stands first at the FLOOR; caps arrive afterward, by recognition.
 *
 * ── ONE FLOOR, NOT TWO KINDS OF HERM ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A crossroads nobody has raised and a hearth whose archive holds shut stand in the SAME state, and naming
 * them apart would freeze a difference that does not survive contact: any vessel at the floor may be raised
 * when someone who can raise it arrives. A wayside herm gets a building raised over it and a hearth fire lit
 * when somebody comes to dwell; the marker was never a different KIND of thing from the house.
 *
 * ── THE FLOOR IS THE HARDENED STATE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A vessel here has lost its CAPS, never its FLOOR: it carries, it serves the public shelf, and it holds
 * every sovereign act closed. Calling that "degraded" reads the safety backwards — the field inverted our
 * first vocabulary (Android's Direct Boot ships this shape; forensics treats before-first-unlock as the
 * HARDENED state and after-first-unlock as the liability, and Google now FORCES the return).
 *
 * So nothing is ever lowered. A vessel that cannot open simply never rose, and a raise that stops being
 * renewed simply stops standing — no party exercises a lowering act, here or anywhere in this house.
 *
 * ── AND THE CEILING LAW SURVIVES THE RAISE, WHICH IS WHY BOTH CAN HOLD ──────────────────────────────────
 * `personaSlotCeiling("herm") === 0` bars a SEATED persona root — a human's key resting on a crossroads,
 * the one thing the class exists to prevent. A raise puts no key there: caps arrive WITH a recognised
 * operator, ride their own keys, and leave when the recognition stops being renewed. The vessel's at-rest
 * state never changes, so a stolen disk still yields nothing of anybody's person.
 *
 * SEATED ⊥ RAISED. The first is storage and stays barred; the second is presence and stays welcome.

 * A Nexus's current lease epoch — the SAME max-register the rest of the house already rolls.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT A THIRD MECHANISM ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A draft of this carried a rolling WINDOW of markers, and a window is a set: it answers //is this listed//
 * and cannot answer //is this newer//, so a partitioned island cannot reason about it locally, and whatever
 * falls off the far end encodes a retention policy nobody wrote down. It also enumerates — a list of valid
 * markers is a roster of moments, and this house holds no rosters.
 *
 * A raise is a capability grant that goes stale by NON-RENEWAL, which is exactly what `epoch-lease` already
 * does for every other grant: a per-resource max-register held as per-writer slots, folded by max, rolled
 * forward by whoever renews. `device-delegation` binds to it with `boundEpoch`. The raise binds the same
 * way, so the mesh carries ONE fencing mechanism rather than one per surface.
 *
 * Read it as: the Nexus is the resource, and its lease epoch is the fence.

/**
 * Whether a raise still stands, read against its Nexus's own lease epoch.
 *
 * ── NO DURATION, NO CLOCK, NO GLOBAL NOW ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A first draft took a wall-clock `now` and an interval, and that form is the one the house forbids: two
 * islands with different clocks disagree about whether a raise stands, and a vessel AT THE FLOOR holds no
 * trustworthy wall time at all — precisely the vessel this law governs.
 *
 * So a raise stands while the Nexus's epoch has not rolled past the epoch it bound to, and stops the moment
 * it has. Supersession and expiry come from one mechanism, driven by the Nexus's own renewals rather than by
 * a duration anybody must agree on. A paused, forwarded or replayed raise self-revokes at the next roll: no
 * global broadcast, no clock, and a returning holder stays fenced whether or not anyone suspected it.
 *
 * The comparison is `>=` because a grant issued AT the current epoch stands until the next roll — the same
 * reading `device-delegation` gives `boundEpoch`, so a reader who knows one knows both.
 *
 * ── AND THE ENDING RIDES A SECOND WIRE, DELIBERATELY NOT FOLDED IN HERE ──────────────────────────────────
 * Deciding "stop waiting for a renewal" cannot be done from safety alone — under asynchrony nothing tells a
 * slow recogniser from a departed one. That decision belongs to the LIVENESS wire: local, monotone,
 * suspicion-accruing, never leaving its island as a timestamp anyone else must agree on. It feeds SUSPICION
 * and never ordering, and acting on a wrong suspicion stays safe because this fence still holds.
 *
 * Fusing the two wires is how a global now gets smuggled back in. They stay apart.
