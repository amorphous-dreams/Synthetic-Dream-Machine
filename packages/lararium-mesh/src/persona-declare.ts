/**
 * persona-declare — what a persona DECLARES about itself outward: its Handle name, and whether it stands
 * for a Kahu seat. The third own-side store, and the one that keeps the other two from welding together.
 *
 * WHY A THIRD STORE. The pet-name (persona-petname) names a compartment to its keeper and their own fleet;
 * the published record (persona-glamour) remembers a face this vessel ALREADY announced. Between them sits a
 * gap: a name the human INTENDS to wear outward, chosen and not yet announced. Reading that intent off the
 * pet-name would weld the private label to the public name — a human whose compartment reads "the-burner"
 * could then never stand under a different declared Handle, and every private label would silently become a public
 * commitment. So the intent gets its own store and its own act.
 *
 * THE BINDING LAW HOLDS ABOVE THIS MODULE (persona-policy#the-binding-law). A declaration DECLARES; only a
 * publicly announced Handle BINDS a PersonaGroup to a public glamour. Nothing here reaches a board — a
 * declared Handle that never announces stays a private intent, and the announce (persona-glamour) remains the
 * separate, deliberate act it always was. The declared string and the pet-name MAY read word-for-word
 * identical; two acts, two owners, and the DECLARING act — never the characters — makes a name public.
 *
 * A SEAT CLAIM ANSWERS TO ITS CHAIR LABEL. `handle` names what a persona answers to outward; `seat` says this
 * persona stands for a Kahu chair on THIS node. A Handle stays an independent, optional outward act.
 *
 * NEVER PUBLICLY FEDERATES — like the pet-name, it fleet-syncs among the human's own vessels. A seat is a
 * local claim about a chair label on a node, and the node's own document records who actually sits (nexus-seal-seed);
 * this store only carries what the human declared, so a peer reading it would learn an intent, never a fact.
