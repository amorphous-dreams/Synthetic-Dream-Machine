/**
 * credit-gate — TWO-SIDED (end-to-end) backpressure: the receiver's drain advertises credits, the
 * producer consumes them. Closes the Nalu canon's explicitly-stated gap (`projection-nalu#network-
 * ring`: "the RECEIVER's gate signals the SENDER — our servo is one-sided today") and cures the
 * BULLWHIP the one-sided AIMD dial generates (a producer reacting to a
 * LOCAL signal without end-to-end sink visibility amplifies oscillation).
 *
 * THE LAW (convergent across credit-based flow control · ant entrance-encounter-rate ·
 * Frank-Starling preload · HPA product-feedback · quorum-sensing): the upstream admission rate is a
 * function of a DOWNSTREAM signal measuring PROVEN DRAIN — never the producer's own guess. Here the
 * downstream signal is the drain-ledger's `uncommitted` backlog (staged-but-not-yet-committed); the
 * true sink (the single-writer committer) drains it, and each commit RETURNS a credit.
 *
 *   credits = maxInFlight − uncommitted     (available admission room)
 *   admit while credits > 0; at 0 → SHED    (reject the sender, not merely slow it)
 *
 * The TWO-LOOP composition with the AIMD dial (concurrency-dial):
 *   - SLOW loop = the AIMD dial discovers `maxInFlight` from latency (slow-start/BDP estimate).
 *   - FAST loop = credits gate each admission on the ACTUAL uncommitted backlog (per-cycle).
 * AIMD alone oscillates (bullwhip); credits pin admission to real drain, damping it.
 *
 * THE SHED (Frank-Starling descending-limb guard): matching outflow to inflow works only to a
 * ceiling; past `maxInFlight` uncommitted, a purely-reactive committer decompensates. So credits ≤ 0
 * must BLOCK/reject the producer (the coagulation threshold / credit-zero-blocks), giving an upper
 * safety valve the one-sided dial lacked.
 *
 * PURE: functions over (maxInFlight, uncommitted). The caller reads `uncommitted` from the
 * drain-ledger's `backlog().length` and `maxInFlight` from the dial's `limit`. Meme:
 * lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/mesh/credit-gate · api/pono/servo
