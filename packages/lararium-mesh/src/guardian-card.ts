/**
 * guardian-card — the shared "Recovery-card" 2-of-3 primitive: ONE card shape, ONE handshake, MANY uses.
 *
 * Two keels split a secret 2-of-3 across the same three custodian slots and hand the operator printable
 * cards to place BY HAND (web3-pure — no cloud/email/API coupling): the CHARTER RESERVE splits the
 * pre-rotation's reserve seed (seal-reserve), and PERSONAL IDENTITY RECOVERY splits the PersonaGroup
 * root (recovery-keel-core). This module holds the piece they share — the card layout, the confirmation
 * handshake, and the split/reconstruct bridge — so BOTH issue the IDENTICAL card:
 *
 *   · "Recovery-card mine"        → custodian "device"       (the operator's copy, vessel-sealed at rest)
 *   · "Recovery-card guardian-A"  → custodian "guardian"     (a guardian holds it, off-device)
 *   · "Recovery-card guardian-B"  → custodian "escrow-peer"  (a second guardian holds it, off-device)
 *
 * The three custodian tags stay DISTINCT so EVERY two-card subset — including {guardian-A, guardian-B} —
 * forms a ≥2-distinct-custodian quorum (recovery-share's impersonation-quorum wall): the two guardians
 * rebuild WITHOUT the operator, and an operator-full-compromise reveals exactly ONE share → nothing. The
 * guardians who hold a citizen's reserve cards hold the SAME card shape that helps recover their identity —
 * one pattern integrity, two uses (isomorphism by composition).
 *
 * WHAT THE CARD RECONSTRUCTS stays the caller's concern, NOT this module's: the reserve rebuilds a reserve
 * seed, identity recovery rebuilds a root the caller uses transiently to sign a re-admit edge then zeroizes
 * (recovery-keel-core). This primitive shares the CARD + HANDSHAKE + 2-of-3 split; it makes NO claim about
 * what the rebuilt secret authorizes.
