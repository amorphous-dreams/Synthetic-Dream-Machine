/**
 * domains — THE REGISTRY. Every domain-separation tag this house mints, in one place, as `lar:` URIs.
 *
 * ── WHAT A DOMAIN TAG IS, AND WHY IT LOOKS LIKE A MAGIC STRING ──────────────────────────────────
 * A signature or a derived key is meaningless without the domain it was made in. The tag rides inside the
 * signed bytes (or the HKDF `info`) so that a signature minted for one purpose can never be replayed as
 * another, and two derivations from one secret can never fuse. Its ONLY job is to differ.
 *
 * That is why it reads opaque, and every serious protocol does the same: HKDF's `info` (RFC 5869), TLS
 * 1.3's `"tls13 "`-prefixed HkdfLabel (RFC 8446 §7.1), MLS's `SignWithLabel` / `EncryptWithLabel` under
 * `"MLS 1.0 "` (RFC 9420), BIP-340's tagged hashes, the Noise protocol NAME hashed into the handshake
 * state, EIP-712's domainSeparator. The constant is protocol identity, never a magic number.
 *
 * ── WHY A TABLE, AND NOT JUST THE STRINGS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Scattered, they cannot be checked. Thirty-two of them once sat across twenty-five files in TWO
 * spellings — `lar-<name>/v<N>` for signing, `"lares <name> v<N>"` for HMAC keys — and nothing could say
 * they differed. A typo in a domain tag does not fail loudly: it silently mints a SECOND protocol whose
 * signatures verify against nothing. Multiformats sets the sharpest prior art, and its whole value rides
 * on THE TABLE AS THE ARTIFACT rather than on the prefixes.
 *
 * ── THE ONTOLOGY: a domain is a NAME, so it takes the house's naming form ───────────────────────
 * `lar:` names and does not fetch (RFC 4151's `tag:` precedent), which is exactly a domain tag's nature:
 * pure bearing, never a fetchable location, never carrying a per-use value. So every domain reads
 *
 *     lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/domain/<name>/v1
 *
 * — the stable `ha.ka.ba` root, one path for the whole family, and the version IN BAND so a v2 can never
 * collide with the v1 it replaces. Versions all read v1: early alpha, no outside consumers, and a `2`
 * that records a past migration encodes archaeology into a protocol string.
 *
 * ── AND A VERSION MUST NEVER DO A DOMAIN'S JOB ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A version digit that carries separation fuses on the first reset. `keyring-envelope` carried `/v1` as
 * its SIGNING domain and `/v2` as its HKDF `info` — two purposes told apart by a digit, so a naive reset
 * to v1 would have fused them; `persona-admit/v2/grant-seal` sat the same way. Each carries its own NAME
 * instead: separation belongs to the name, and the version belongs to the protocol's own history.
 *
 * ── HOW TO ADD ONE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Add it HERE, exported, and use the export. `tools/domain-registry-witness.sh` refuses a duplicate, a
 * malformed address, and any domain literal written outside this file.
 *
 * Canon: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/lar-uri
