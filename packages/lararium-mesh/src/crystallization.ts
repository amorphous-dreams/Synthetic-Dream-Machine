/**
 * crystallization — the memetic crystallization cap: it READS whether a recurring pattern FIXES into shared
 * grammar. A pattern crystallizes when it does two things at once, mirroring how a solid condenses out of a
 * melt: it NUCLEATES across strata (born past r* — cross-coordinate corroboration, never lone-plane frequency)
 * AND it re-LOCKS its recurrence rhythm (rigid — a time-crystal beat that survives a perturbation). STANDS =
 * born ⊕ rigid. The cap reuses the machinery whole: `nucleate` decides birth, `temporalRigidity` decides
 * standing; this file only WIRES a lens onto their inputs.
 *
 * THE LENS (the tunable part). The nucleation PLANES become the lens STRATA — a decomposition of the
 * occurrence stream by a coordinate the block ALREADY carries (a #has cap; the lens presupposes no schema).
 * `stratumOf` names the grouping coordinate, so the lens stays TUNABLE, never hardwired:
 *   · role ∈ {operator, agent}   — the operator|agent lens (ONE instance);
 *   · stream-id                   — comparing two+ captured streams (another instance);
 *   · any spatial/temporal axis   — "spoken from role XYZ at turn ABC".
 * A pattern crossing ONLY one stratum yields ONE plane → the gate's `(effectivePlanes − 1)` factor zeroes the
 * drive → never born. So single-coordinate frequency can NEVER crystallize; only cross-stratum agreement can.
 *
 * WHY NO OUTPUT-CORRELATION COLLAPSE (the shore vs the Sink). The Sink passes `planeCorrelation` so DERIVED
 * detectors reading one signal collapse to ~1 effective plane. This lens does the OPPOSITE on purpose: its
 * strata name genuinely DISTINCT speakers/streams (different roles, different captures), so two strata moving
 * in lockstep read as the STRONGEST crystallization — real cross-speaker consensus — not a derived echo. The
 * lens therefore treats distinct coordinate values as independent corroborating strata and omits the
 * collapse matrix; the caller who wants echo-collapse groups by a coordinate that already separates sources.
