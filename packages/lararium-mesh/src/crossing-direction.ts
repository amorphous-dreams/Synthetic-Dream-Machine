/**
 * crossing-direction — which way a transfer runs, and what that costs.
 *
 * ── ONE DIRECTION RELAXES CONFINEMENT; THE OTHER RAISES IT ──────────────────────────────────────
 * Copying a tiddler from a public bag into a more private one leaves it reaching FEWER readers than
 * the original does. TW5's recipe stack runs on that shape — a user takes a public tiddler and keeps a
 * shadowed copy they may alter — and federation hands every user a public shelf to take from. Nothing
 * leaves, so nothing needs a ceremony.
 *
 * Copying the other way makes material held for few into material held for many, and publication
 * admits no return: no reverse crossing exists, and new residency gets granted outward instead.
 * Information-flow work restricts exactly this direction and permits the inward one freely.
 *
 * ── SO THE COST SITS ON THE OUTWARD CROSSING ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A user may copy and alter a public tiddler into a more private bag. Moving anything from a private
 * bag toward a public one belongs to the kahu quorum's seated signers, whose threshold carries the integrity that
 * the decision to relax demands — a per-vessel `admin` cap answers for one hand, and a crossing that
 * cannot be walked back wants more hands than one.
 *
 * ── CHEAP DIFFERS FROM UNGATED ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * An inward crossing still answers for its source at `read`. A caller reaching a bag it may not read
 * stays a confused deputy whichever way the copy runs, and the direction changes the price rather than
 * removing it.
 *
 * This names the cost and collects none of it: it holds no keys, verifies no quorum, and reaches no
 * bag. The gate reads it and does the asking.
