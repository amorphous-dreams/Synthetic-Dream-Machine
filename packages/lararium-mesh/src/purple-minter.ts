/**
 * purple-minter — mint a RECEIVER-BOUNDARY (purple) sink at the cross-plane closure. A cymatic sink gets
 * DETECTED (it sits in the data); only a purple one — present in no single plane, bridged where the
 * planes cross — the receiver MINTS. The mint carries a UUID-first pet-name (named before understood), a
 * closure-vector (the metameric-basin key — many event-logs collapsing to the nearest basin within radius
 * become ONE sink), and the co-attesting planes the ring wrapped. The crucible-before-binding floor (commit-dial)
 * rides in the mint: a PROPOSED mint stands minted-but-unbound until it crosses the floor.
 *
 * The pet-name generator arrives INJECTED (mintId) — a runtime passes crypto.randomUUID; a test passes a
 * counter, so the mint stays deterministic. The Ki-plane bridging node rides back as data (the planes it
 * joins), never a side-effect — the caller wires it into the reaction-graph.
