/**
 * carriage-caps — the ISOMORPHIC carriage machinery, on the mesh floor where every vessel reaches it.
 *
 * These caps wire a vessel's PUBLIC FLOW-map (the meshpalace doc) and the blind relay that carries it across
 * the astral space — platform-blind by construction (no node http Server, no tw5 wiki). A hearth, a
 * crossroads and a browser leaf compose the SAME pair through `carriageStack` (below) and differ only

 * Layer law: `@lararium/mesh` is the LOWEST package — it CANNOT import `@lararium/tw5` (circular). So the
 * substrate cap-id rides here as a WIRE-STRING (`SUBSTRATE_CAP_ID`), matched by VALUE to tw5's
 * `CORE_CAP.substrate` at handshake time — cap-ids are handshake strings, matched by value, not by import.

 * browser leaf composing the SAME carriage rather than three hand-copied config blocks that drift.
 *
 * `self` carries the vessel's mesh standing (`deriveMeshSelf` at an anchor, `deriveMeshLeaf` in a
 * browser). PRESENT → the vessel self-announces its dial(s), seeds a routing slot, and re-ranks
 * against its own coord; a self with no `endpoint` announces no dial and rides as a leaf that
 * carries-in only. ABSENT → an empty FLOW-map and a carriage with no peers: the map still stands, so
 * a cap that requires it (the Herm's public read-face) composes on a vessel that has met nobody yet.
 *
