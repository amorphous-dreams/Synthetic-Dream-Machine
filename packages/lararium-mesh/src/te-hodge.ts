/**
 * te-hodge — the coupling plane's OWN co-consistency instrument: a discrete Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition
 * of the directed transfer-entropy flow, read for its CIRCULATION. This re-founds the ki (cosheaf)
 * co-restrictions on the flow BETWEEN streams — retiring the MODWT-MRA wavelet scaffold that answered a
 * change-point question (a regime turnover) with spurious low-frequency power (a bandpass reports where
 * energy at its scale concentrates; a regime turnover is not a period the signal ever held).
 *
 * THE FLOW carries no presupposed name. It arrives as `MeshCoupling.te` — a directed nagare between the
 * children (`te[i][j]` = TE i→j bits), gathered by the coupler, not asserted here. The decomposition hands
 * the flow's parts working handles by what they DO, never by an essence:
 *
 *   • the GRADIENT part — the flow a single node POTENTIAL carries: `grad(i,j) = s(j) − s(i)`. A flow that
 *     reduces to such a potential collapses to one stream's "who-leads-whom" ranking and holds NO fact a
 *     coarsening of one stream could not already reach — the reducible part.
 *   • the ROTATIONAL part — the residual `r = w − grad`, whose CIRCULATION around a cycle admits no
 *     potential. This is the part that stays a relation between two streams: the irreducible coupling the
 *     ki-radius reads.
 *
 * The net flow rides the COMPLETE graph on the children (a χ²-gated edge carries net flow 0, a legitimate
 * "no significant asymmetry" reading — not a missing edge), so the HodgeRank potential closes in one line:
 * `s = div / n` (the graph Laplacian of K_n acts as `n·s` on the mean-zero divergence, and the net flow's
 * divergence is mean-zero by antisymmetry). On K_n there is no harmonic part — the residual is pure curl.
 *
 * WHAT THIS READS, PRECISELY: on the complete graph the circulation is LOCAL curl (`im δ¹`), cohomologically
 * TRIVIAL (`H¹ = ker Δ₁ = 0` — the filled clique complex of K_n is contractible; Jiang–Lim–Yao–Ye 2011,
 * arXiv:0811.1067; Lim, SMETA Review 2020, arXiv:1507.05379). So the read certifies the COUPLING signal — the
 * flow content NO lead-lag potential explains — NOT a topological cocycle. A genuine harmonic `H¹` would need
 * an INCOMPLETE flow graph (some triangles unfilled, `ker Δ₁ ≠ 0`) and a projection onto `ker Δ₁`; that is a
 * separate reading, and it stays a DIFFERENT obstruction from the li∘ki cross-cover square's sheaf `H¹` (a
 * different complex — the cover nerve — with sheaf coefficients). This organ never certifies that square.
 *
 * The circulation around each triangle `(i,j,k)` is `w(i,j) + w(j,k) + w(k,i)` (the gradient telescopes to
 * 0 around any cycle). {@link teFlowHodgeCoRestrictions} carries the two Hodge parts as cosheaf faces over
 * the triangle cofaces — the gradient face reads circulation 0 everywhere (a theorem), the rotational face
 * reads the actual curl — so {@link kiCoConsistency} co-extends (radius 0) exactly when the flow is
 * curl-free (a pure lead-lag potential, no irreducible coupling), and localizes any residual circulation to
 * the offending triangle. Drop-in for the retired MODWT-MRA co-restriction shore, zero call-site change.
 *
 * Whether the convergence this reads estimates one real quantity (inflationary) or grows wherever any
 * instrument imposes structure (deflationary) stays LIVE — this organ files the flow's parts by what they
 * carry and lets the aperture (the triangle cofaces) narrow them; it names no quantity it then hunts for.

 * INCOMPLETE flow graph — the genuine harmonic reading (`ker Δ₁ ≠ 0`)
 *
 * The closed form `s = div/n` above rides the COMPLETE graph K_n, where every triple fills a triangle
 * and the clique complex contracts (`H¹ = 0`). Here the caller hands an EXPLICIT present-edge set: a pair
 * `(i,j)` carries a real edge, and any absent pair reads as GENUINELY missing — a hole the flow may
 * circulate, NOT a χ²-gated "no asymmetry" zero. Absent edges leave triangles unfilled, so `ker Δ₁` can
 * stand nonzero and the residual splits into a curl part (bounded by present triangles) PLUS a harmonic
 * part (a cycle that bounds no filled triangle). The read hands each part a handle by what it DOES:
 *
 *   • the GRADIENT part — the flow a node potential carries, `w(i,j) = s[i] − s[j]`, recovered by solving
 *     the PRESENT-edge graph Laplacian `L0 · s = div` (matrix-free conjugate gradient, s kept mean-zero).
 *   • the CURL part — the residual content the present triangles EXPLAIN, `im(B2ᵀ)`, reached by projecting
 *     the residual onto the triangle up-image (CG on the triangle up-Laplacian `B2·B2ᵀ`).
 *   • the HARMONIC part — the residual NO gradient and NO present-triangle explains: `harmonic = r − curlProj`,
 *     a divergence-free curl-free cycle. Its ENERGY `‖harmonic‖²` reads the irreducible topological content,
 *     and `β₁ = E − N + C − rank(B2)` counts the holes carrying it.
 *
 * HONESTY (the load-bearing distinction): this harmonic `H¹` reads the FLOW GRAPH's first cohomology
 * (`ker Δ₁` of the 1-skeleton-plus-filled-triangles complex on the children). It stays a DIFFERENT
 * obstruction from the li∘ki cross-cover square's SHEAF `H¹` — a different complex (the cover nerve) with
 * sheaf coefficients (Hansen–Ghrist 2019). This organ never certifies that square; it reads only the flow.
