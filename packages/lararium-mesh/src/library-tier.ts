/**
 * library-tier — the ACQUIRED tier: bodies a human did not author, kept readable, verifiable, and out of
 * every tracked tree.
 *
 * WHY IT STANDS APART FROM `cas`. The runtime CAS holds DERIVED blobs — engine builds, plugin bundles —
 * which regenerate from the plain-data genesis seed, so `reset` pares them freely and its own comment licenses the
 * pare on exactly that premise. An ACQUIRED body regenerates from nothing. Housing the two together would
 * put a corpus nobody can rebuild inside a directory documented as safe to destroy. Two names, two
 * durabilities, and the difference visible in the path — the same cut the Nexus seal took when it left the
 * bags tree, for the same reason.
 *
 * ── WHY NOT THE SEED SURFACE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `bags/` carries what an operator AUTHORS: it round-trips because a human edits it, and the projection law
 * tests that with a parse∘render fixed point. An acquired book has no fixed point and no author here — it
 * sits in `bags/` by accident of arrival. Left there it enters git history, and a shelf that grows with
 * every book grows the history with it. So the bytes leave, and the bag keeps the HANDLE.
 *
 * ── THE LAYOUT, AND WHAT EACH LEVEL BUYS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *     <library>/<collection>/<cid>/<the real filename>
 *     <library>/<collection>/<cid>/meta.json
 *
 *   · COLLECTION on top so a reference names a WALKABLE root — a pour points at `library:mark-twain` and
 *     `os.walk` finds the books, with no index consulted and no symlink to break on a foreign platform.
 *   · CID beneath it so identity stays content-addressed: the directory name IS the digest, so integrity
 *     audits with `sha256sum` and no tooling.
 *   · THE REAL FILENAME inside, so the store reads as a library rather than as a heap of hex. `cat` works,
 *     `grep` works, and a human browsing it recognises what they are looking at.
 *   · meta.json beside it, so a body self-describes IN ISOLATION — origin, licence, media-type, anchor.
 *     A blob that needs an index to say what it is cannot be audited alone, and audit alone is the point.
 *
 * ONE HONEST COST: a body in two collections stores twice. Dedup would want hardlinks, and hardlinks break
 * across filesystems and read poorly on Windows. Paying bytes to keep the layout portable and link-free
 * reads as the better trade at this scale; a `by-cid` index can reclaim it later without moving anything.
 *
 * ── A REFERENCE NAMES, IT NEVER PATHS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `library:<collection>` travels; a directory does not. Same law the repo registry runs and the `lar:` URI
 * before it — the artifact names WHAT, each vessel resolves WHERE. A bed manifest carrying an absolute path
 * would pour on one machine and refuse on every other.
 *
 * Meme: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/mesh/content-resolution
