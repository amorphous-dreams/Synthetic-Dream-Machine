/**
 * realm-admission — the SHORE that admits INTO A REALM, composing the two signals into one verdict.
 *
 * It gates ONE realm (`realmDocIdHex`), never the super-mesh: a crossing cleared here buys standing in the
 * cabal-realm that priced it, and nothing beyond. DreamNet names what realms federate INTO, never a thing
 * anyone crosses into by admission.
 *
 * ── WHICH PLANE THIS SITS ON ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A REALM is a cabal's shared CRDT and resources. A CABAL is the collective holding them. A NEXUS is the
 * federated mesh of hardware. Admission is a fact about the COLLECTIVE — who joins — and reaching the
 * realm is what joining grants. Canon #112 rules those apart: "Two managements wear one word, and a
 * reading that fuses them mis-sites every seat it names… those seats sit on the vessel and the charter,
 * never in the realm."
 *
 * So `realmDocIdHex` here names the cabal by its realm's doc, and that is CORRECT rather than a missing
 * name: a cabal IS the shared relation over its realm's resources, so identity-as-relation gives it no
 * other name to have. What a reader must not conclude is that the realm therefore owns the ACT.
 * `cabal-invite`, `vouchEntryKey` and `cabalAdmissionEpoch` all sit on this side of that line; the realm's
 * own epoch is its maintenance feed, addressed separately (`realmFeedPrefix`).
 *
 * The two gates stand apart and complete: `cabal-invite` answers the STRUCTURAL question (does a licensed
 * member vouch for this joiner, into THIS realm, unexpired?) and `admission-price` answers the MARGINAL one
 * (what does this crossing cost, given the applicant's lineage rank and the vouching cluster's
 * concentration?). Admission runs both, in that order, and reports the FIRST that refuses.
 *
 * WHY THE INVITE COMES FIRST. The structural check runs cheap, offline, and decisive: no invite under an
 * invite-only policy ends the crossing before anything walks the lineage. Pricing an applicant nobody vouched for
 * would compute a number no one can pay and call it a refusal — the invite gate says the same thing sooner,
 * and names WHY (no-invite / wrong-realm / wrong-joiner / expired / bad-signature) where a bare price cannot.
 *
 * WHY THE VOUCHER ANCHORS THE PRICE. The invite already names the voucher who staked their standing; that
 * same voucher IS the cluster whose concentration the convex wall reads. So the two gates share one fact —
 * the co-pay falls on the hand that signed the invite — and the caller never has to name the cluster twice.
 *
 * REFUSAL IS ANERGY, END TO END. Neither gate bans, remembers, or writes anything down. An applicant refused
 * for want of an invite, or priced out by a cluster nearing the ceiling, stays at the floor and may return
 * with a stronger vouch. This composition adds no memory of its own.
 *
 * VERDICT-BEARING, NOT VERDICT-DECIDING. It returns whether the crossing clears and what it cost; it admits
 * no one and mints no membership. The keyhive ceremony (`runApplyAdmitPayload`) runs BEHIND a cleared verdict,
 * one layer up, where the platform lives — this module holds no key and touches no store.
 *
 * Platform-blind: rides ./cabal-invite + ./admission-price only. NO node: imports.
