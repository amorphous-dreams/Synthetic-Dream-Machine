/**
 * worldline-inject-detect — the RHIZOME'S BRANCH-POINTS: detect a mid-flight INJECTION (a
 * SendMessage-continue reaching a RUNNING spirit) in a spirit's transcript, and turn each into a
 * `prov:Communication` edge (the rhizome's merge-where-messages-land leg, mesh/worldline-edge).
 *
 * ## Feasibility (the slice-2 flag, confirmed)
 *
 * The current Claude-Code subagent model is mostly ONE-HANDOFF / run-to-completion: a spirit's
 * transcript carries one initial task prompt then its own assistant turns + tool-result echoes, and
 * worldline-observe (lararium-mempalace) reads only spawn→handback from it. A `SendMessage`-continue
 * — re-entering a spawned agent with its context intact — appends a SECOND top-level USER prompt
 * AFTER the spirit had produced output. THAT is the one distinguishable mid-flight signal.
 *
 * So the DETECTABLE injection point = a `user` turn AFTER the first that is NOT a tool-result echo
 * (tool results also arrive as `user`-type turns, but carry `tool_result` content blocks). Each such
 * turn is a re-entry → a Communication edge: the injector (the parent/root that sent the message)
 * `wasInformedBy`-reaches the target spirit's handle, turnKey = the injected turn's uuid.
 *
 * WHAT ISN'T DETECTABLE (flagged, not built): WHO injected (operator vs parent) is not in the spirit
 * transcript — the caller supplies the injector (the parent handle is the safe default; a parent
 * SendMessage and an operator-relayed one both land as a parent-origin re-entry from the spirit's
 * vantage). The CONTENT/bearing of the injection is unread (full ticks beat a lossy parse — the
 * worldlineInject D-cut). And whether the harness even writes a continuation as a distinguishable
 * user turn needs a real SendMessage-continue transcript to confirm — this detector stands READY for
 * that signal, tested against the transcript SHAPE.
 *
 * PURE / IO-free: classification takes raw jsonl lines (strings); the fs walk + the KG persist stay
 * node-side (worldline-observe's shore), which composes these functions over real transcript files.
