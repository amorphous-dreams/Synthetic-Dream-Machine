/**
 * compose-follow — the ONE gesture that composes the three LOCAL identity stores into a follow.
 *
 * "Adding to a circle IS the follow" (social-seed). A follow reaches for THREE local stores and NEVER a
 * board: it RECOGNISES a nym in the handle-book (TOFU — the recogniser's private memory of others' keys),
 * optionally SETS the recogniser's private label for it (the local petname, per-nym, never on the wire), and
 * ADDS the nym to a circle (the IoC social graph, private to the owning node). All three writes land locally;
 * NOTHING crosses to the crossroads plane. The ONLY federated surface a human ever presents stays the glamour they
 * DELIBERATELY publish (who-face / handle-announce) — a separate, conscious act this module never performs.
 *
 * NEVER-FEDERATES, STRUCTURALLY. The proof is not a runtime check but the SHAPE of the shores: composeFollow
 * consumes a HandleBook (pure, I/O-free, holds no key and touches no network) and a `CircleStore` (a LOCAL
 * membership store — node-fs / IDB / a future PRIVATE-bag adapter). No board, announce, or crossroads shore
 * is injectable here, so no follow can reach the wire. `FollowResult.federated` reads the literal `false` —
 * the type says the follow left no central trace. A user leaves no roster entry; the graph stays home.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED on recognition. A follow of an UNKNOWN nym with no card to admit it REFUSES (a designation must
 * carry its authority — you cannot name-into-a-circle a handle you have never met). Carry a self-certifying
 * HandleCard to TOFU-admit the nym first; a garbled card draws the book's named verdict, never a silent add.
 *
 * Platform-blind: rides ./handle-book + ./handle-card only. NO node: imports — the CLI and the browser both
 * consume this, each supplying its own local CircleStore adapter.
