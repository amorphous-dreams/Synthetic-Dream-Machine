/**
 * lar-event-bus — Verse-shaped event subscription interface for the Lararium tick loop.
 *
 * Adopts the SHAPE of Verse structured concurrency (subscribable<T> / listenable<T>,
 * race / branch scope-bound tasks) without coupling to UEFN's fixed global tick rate.
 *
 * Concurrency constraints that differ from Verse:
 *   - CRDT merges are always-commit — no STM rollback across Automerge boundaries.
 *   - Automerge operates on wall-clock async I/O time (irregular); the simulation
 *     tick runs on a configurable fixed rate. These are TWO time bases with explicit
 *     bridging, not one unified clock.
 *   - `branch` tasks scope to session lifetime, not UEFN actor lifetime.
 *
 * Runtime implementation lives in @lararium/node (LarEventBusImpl).
 * This file carries only the interface contracts and supporting types.
 *
 * Prior art: Verse subscribable<T>/listenable<T> (Epic UEFN), Nakama MatchLoop,
 * Flecs RateFilter, Akka timer+mailbox, structured concurrency (Kotlinx/Swift).
 *
 * Meme: lar:///ha.ka.ba/@lararium/mesh/v0.1/lar-event-bus
