/**
 * flow — the FlowTiddler schema + the curated flow-set.
 *
 * A Flow is a PET-NAMED, composed cap-stack + targeting: the human/AI-facing unit a single
 * verb calls against one or more sensoria. Flows exist to KILL verb sprawl — the low-level
 * instruments (phase · crystallize · ki · li · whiten · couple · gate · mismatch · …) stop
 * being the SURFACE and become the building blocks a Flow composes. The surface becomes a
 * small, learnable flow-set: one verb (`lares flow <petname>`), one MCP command, each flow
 * pet-named by its own `lar:` URI tiddler-title.
 *
 * A Flow tiddler lives in the sovereign `daemon` bag; the daemon dispatcher (the verb-tiddler
 * protocol) reads it, runs its `capStack` against the target(s), and lands the outcome in
 * `bags/daemon/outcomes/`. Composition rides the EXISTING Verb protocol — no new plumbing: a flow
 * invocation is a Verb with `action="flow"`, `args.petname`, and `targets = [sensorium URIs]`.
 * The daemon is the one seat that reaches both hulls, so it routes each cap-step by its `hull`.
 *
 * Meme: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/mesh/flow
