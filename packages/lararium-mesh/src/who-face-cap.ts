/**
 * who-face-cap — the isomorphic vessel cap that wires the WHO plane (identity federation).
 *
 * The identity sibling of meshPalaceCap: where the carriage cap wires the meshpalace FLOW-map (WHERE to
 * dial), this wires the per-Nexus WHO board (WHO a veiled-user is) — the two-key atom's two planes, two caps.
 * A vessel composing this cap resolves its Nexus's WHO board through crossroads (the public plane),
 * layers the board WRITABLE so the relay syncs it, and NEVER announces a face of its own. Pulling
 * peers' cards into a HandleBook rides the returned component's `ingest`.
 *
 * Isomorphic and platform-blind, exactly like meshPalaceCap: a browser vessel composes the very same cap a
 * node does. The board carries no write-ACL — the self-certifying card is the trust (who-face), so an
 * openly-synced board stays forgery-proof. Requires the substrate (the composite to layer the board into).
 *
 * Canon: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/docs/crossroads · lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/persona-circle#the-vault
