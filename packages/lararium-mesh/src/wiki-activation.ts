/**
 * wiki-activation — the ACTIVATION-ON-REFERENCE capability (a base mesh #has cap).
 *
 * A reference to a wiki grain ACTIVATES it (Orleans virtual-actors: the grain
 * wakes on reference; the caller need not know it slept). The vessel HOLDS this
 * cap; the resolver READS it — so verb routing calls `ensureActive(wikiId)` and
 * only then places the verb, instead of rejecting a cold grain outright. A
 * cold→wela activation is a LOCAL-FIRST act on the vessel's own island (no global
 * now): it heats the grain through the ONE residency collector, which mounts a
 * cold grain (onHydrate → pool.ensureWiki) and enforces the wiki cap (onEvict →
 * pool.unmountWiki the LRU wiki), all single-flight (one sovereign body per stream).
 *
 * ONE cap, a SPECTRUM of grants (the vessel gradient): a resource-rich vessel
 * (node) advertises a high `activationCap` + `pinBudget` (concurrent multi-wiki);
 * a constrained vessel (browser) advertises a minimal grant (the daemon bag always + a
 * small active set), degrading gracefully — the resolver honors whatever grant the
 * vessel carries. The daemon bag's always-there pin holds on every grant level; the user
 * MAY hold up to `pinBudget` further rotatable wiki pins (vessel-resource scaled).
