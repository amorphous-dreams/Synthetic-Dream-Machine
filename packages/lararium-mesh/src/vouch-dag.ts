/**
 * vouch-dag — fold issued invites into the seed-rooted vouch DAG the lineage price walks.
 *
 * THE FEEDER. `admission-price` prices a crossing against a vouch DAG; nothing produced that DAG from the
 * invites the mesh actually issues. This shore carries it: an accepted `CabalInvite` RIDES as a directed edge
 * (voucher → joiner), and a run of them folds into the `VouchEdge[]` that `rankLineage` scores. Each
 * admission adds an edge, so the graph the NEXT admission prices against carries the trace of every crossing
 * before it.
 *
 * CANONICALISE AT THE BOUNDARY, OR THE FOLD SILENTLY SEVERS. A principal appears twice in a lineage — once
 * as the JOINER of the invite that admitted it, once as the VOUCHER of an invite it later signs — and the
 * seed-rooted fold connects the two ONLY when both read as the same vertex. Transitivity IS the composition
 * "j vouches i ∧ i vouches k" over one `i` (EigenTrust, personalized PageRank, Advogato all require it;
 * UCAN makes it the `aud`=`iss` rule). Our identifiers arrive in two forms — a DID `0x<key>` and a raw
 * `<key>` hex — so the SAME principal would mint two vertices, its subtree would detach from the seed, and
 * its score would collapse to the ε-floor. The cure runs one canonicaliser over EVERY endpoint before it
 * touches the graph: connectivity becomes a byte-equality test on the raw key.
 *
 * CAP THE OUT-DEGREE, BECAUSE THE ATTACK EDGE IS THE CHOKE. By mass conservation a voucher's score SPLITS
 * across everyone it vouches for, so minting sybils downstream only re-divides the mass that already crossed
 * the voucher's own edge — a node cannot raise its impact by issuing more vouches (Appleseed's bottleneck
 * property; Levien's Advogato min-cut). The remaining lever counts the attack EDGES, so a per-voucher
 * out-degree cap bounds the mass any one hand can inject. The cap never silently truncates — the fold reports
 * every edge it dropped.
 *
 * KEY SEPARATION IS A PRIVACY PLANE, NOT A SYBIL ONE. The `vouchKeyOf` resolver maps a joiner's
 * join-identity to the identity it will later present as a voucher. Its DEFAULT holds identity — the
 * sybil-strong, privacy-weak baseline where a member vouches under the key it joined with. A non-identity
 * resolver enacts the persona key-separation (join under A, vouch under B), which buys UNLINKABILITY and
 * NOTHING for the sybil bound: a derived key never manufactures a second human, so the bound must already
 * hold at the join gate. A separated resolver additionally needs a common-origin proof to keep the graph
 * connected without publishing A↔B — that proof, and who anchors it, live on the privacy plane above this
 * module, never here.
 *
 * Platform-blind: rides ./cabal-invite + ./lineage-rank only. NO node: imports, no key, no I/O.
 * Meme: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/lararium-identity#/the-siege-gate
