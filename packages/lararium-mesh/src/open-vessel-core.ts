 *
 * VM-FREE by design — this owns the substrate-level keel (composite cascade,
 * genesis island layer, social plane, daemon doc, wiki-slot layers), so it lives in
 * mesh, NOT tw5. The VM-focused pieces (daemon-VM spawn, primary-wiki mount, island
 * pool) stay in the platform keel / tw5. The one tw5-class the keel needs — the
 * volatile temp store — injects as `tempStore`, so mesh holds zero tw5 dep.
 *
 * NO `if (platform)` enters here. A capability the keel omits simply does not run.
 * The shore for every capability stays open on both substrates so the browser SHALL
 * grow into init/PersonaGroup/genesis/corpus/residency.
