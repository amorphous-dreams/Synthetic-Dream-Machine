/**
 * spectral-keel-cap — the ocap capability line over the spectral keel (Sprint-2 R3). The READ/WRITE verb-
 * split IS the capability boundary: an island composes `project` always (read the frozen anchor), and gains
 * `track` (drift the live subspace) ONLY when the `capture-island` write-authority cap rides its
 * #has-cap-stack. Miller's facet pattern (Robust Composition, 2006) on the existing composeVessel present-
 * optional: the keel cap-module mints the full keel ONCE (parenthood, the powerbox — the handle never leaves
 * the build frame), reads the write grant at COMPOSE time (not a call-time `if (!hasCap) throw`), and hands
 * out the attenuated facet. A capless island's reference simply LACKS `.track` — blind by composition, the
 * poisoning surface closed by structure. `freeze` + the anchorFacet (re-anchor cap) ride the next sprint.
 *
 * Confused-deputy ward (two levels): compose-time POLA (the resolver reaches only declared deps) + call-time
 * direct closure (each verb closes over ITS keel's own state — no ambient keel registry, no Π-by-id lookup).
