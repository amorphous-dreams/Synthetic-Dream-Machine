/**
 * signer-class — which of a human's keys may stand on an artifact that travels.
 *
 * ── THE THREE KEYS ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A vessel-key is device-minted, its private half never leaving, and it "MUST NEVER co-surface" with
 * the layer above. A PersonaGroup root binds one human's OWN DEVICES into an overlay. A veiled-user
 * key is "the sovereign pseudonym presented through the veil" — the public Handle, and the only one
 * of the three meant to be seen.
 *
 * ── AND A TRAVELLING ARTIFACT PUBLISHES WHATEVER IT CARRIES ─────────────────────────────────────
 * A charter must travel before a joining operator can consent, because its seated keys are the
 * material she verifies a quorum against. A shared members board carries the stamps that contracted
 * into a Cabal. Both are public by construction, so whichever key class they name is published, and a
 * key published once cannot be unpublished.
 *
 * Publishing a PersonaGroup root puts a human's device-overlay on the artifact; publishing several
 * from one vault correlates them to each other, which is what a founding seat does by drawing every
 * chair from one identity home. The public Handle carries the same verification and none of that.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS DOES, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It READS a key's class against material this vessel already holds. It moves no key, seats nothing,
 * and decides no policy — re-keying an artifact that is already sealed changes its epoch, which is a
 * founding act rather than a wiring one.
 *
 * An unrecognised key reads UNKNOWN rather than safe. A travelling artifact is the wrong place to
 * guess, because the cost of a wrong yes is permanent, and a vessel legitimately cannot classify a
 * key belonging to somebody else.
