/**
 * mesh-coupling-mv — the DEFAULT multivariate mesh coupling (the locked keel), the
 * continuous-vector twin of mesh-coupling. Each child is a CONTINUOUS signed-innovation VECTOR
 * series; each directed edge is a native Gaussian conditional-TE, conditioned on ALL the other
 * children JOINTLY (the full-N-way conditioning that keeps the read synergy-aware and kills the
 * common-driver phantom for any N, not just three).
 *
 * This is the default path; the discrete-symbol `coupleMeshChildren` stays as the dependency-light
 * hot-path read, and KSG-multivariate (nonlinear escalation) rides the IDTxl holder behind a
 * linearity gate — neither is here. The wire carries continuous reals; discretization never touches
 * this path (it would break the Gaussian covariance the same way it breaks kNN geometry).
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATION: total conditional-TE reports that an edge
 * exists, never whether it is synergistic vs redundant — a purely 3-way (XOR) coupling stays
 * invisible to any pairwise-conditioned matrix; separating synergy needs PID, a separate instrument.
 *
 * Platform-blind: composes ./gaussian-cmi + reuses ./mesh-coupling's MeshCoupling shape. NO imports.
