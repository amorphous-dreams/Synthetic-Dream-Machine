/**
 * who-face — resolve the per-Nexus WHO board through the crossroads public plane, then announce onto it.
 *
 * This is the wiring glue between three pieces already built: the crossroads public oracle plane (the
 * pointer home, lar-uris), the satellite-pointer protocol (resolveOracleDoc, base-doc), and the card↔doc
 * bridge (handle-announce). A crossroads-plane tiddler at the nexusHandlesUri key holds the WHO board's automerge:
 * URL; a vessel resolves that pointer (open-or-mint, write-back on first mint) and gets the shared board a
 * stranger can reach without standing in any operator's grant graph.
 *
 * The board carries NO write-ACL, by design: a handle-card is self-certifying (valid only if signed by its
 * own nym), so an openly-appendable board stays trustworthy — forgery is structurally impossible, and a
 * recogniser's acceptHandleUpdate vets every card. Trust rides the card, never a per-writer capability (the
 * Nostr-relay model: validity lives in the signature). "Public" grants an anonymous principal read; the gate
 * still holds (pull ≠ read) — a garbage or unsigned tiddler is simply ignored at ingest.
 *
 * Pure and platform-blind: the caller supplies the repo `resolve` strategy (node races whenReady, browser
 * reads progress through `findWithProgress`, since `allowableStates` no longer has any effect),
 * exactly as resolveOracleDoc already splits. Holds no key, mounts no HTTP.
 *
 * Canon: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/docs/crossroads (the public plane); persona-circle#the-vault (the WHO model).
