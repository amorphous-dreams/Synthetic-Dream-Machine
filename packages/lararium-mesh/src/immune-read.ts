/**
 * immune-read — the danger-model as code (Matzinger; swarm-confirmed). A defensive response
 * against an actor is licensed by CONTEXT — a bad signal-pattern corroborated by a neighbor —
 * NEVER by identity or persistence. The default is TOLERANCE; the response is ANERGY (the
 * veil disarmed but persisting, re-presentable at the anon floor after its lease decays),
 * NEVER a ban/delete. Per-vessel-veil; a standing, lossy process, never "solved".
 *
 * Two proven guards ride here:
 *   · TWO-SIGNAL costimulation — anergy fires only on the actor's OWN threat-signal (Signal-1)
 *     AND an INDEPENDENT neighbor's corroboration (Signal-2). One flag alone never anergizes —
 *     that is the guard against AUTOIMMUNITY (a single false accusation can't disarm a healthy
 *     veil).
 *   · CONTEXT, not identity — persistence≠legitimacy in the immune layer too: a pledged
 *     Handle is NOT immune. If its pattern reads threat and a neighbor corroborates, it
 *     anergizes exactly like a throwaway. Presence proves nothing; behavior-in-context licenses.
 *
 * The DIALS (what rate/flag count reads as threat, how long anergy holds) are the operator's
 * fairness settings — parameters here, never baked.
 *
 * Platform-blind: rides ./veil-ladder types only. NO node: imports.
 * Meme: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/the-veil-ladder
