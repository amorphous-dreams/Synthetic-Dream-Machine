 * sensory-shore — the GENERIC child-clasp, generalizing who-sensory-shore to any mesh child

 * events into the sensorium's frames via a modality-specific signal (+ optional content) map;
 * corroboration + the two-signal immune read are already target-parameterized (immune-read /
 * who-sensory-shore), so they compose unchanged.
 *
 * Each child's SIGNAL is its own domain's numerics — the bands + coupling planes read them, and
 * `mesh-coupling` couples the three streams (phantom-guarded). Content (a name) rides the
 * content-embed plane when the event carries one.
 *
 * Platform-blind: rides ./stream-adapter (their contract) + ./immune-read + ./mesh-coupling.
