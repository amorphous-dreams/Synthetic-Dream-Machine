/**
 * capture-engine — the ISOMORPHIC telemetry-VM worker: a self-regulating DUAL-FAMILY cell.
 * The pure capture core, composed from injected substrate shores; the SAME cell runs in every
 * vessel, only the shores differ by capability (role = capability ≠ platform).
 *
 * BOTH gate families ride this ONE substrate (the projection-nalu pattern integrity — the neuron
 * that is graded on its dendrites AND spiking on its axon):
 *   - IN = accumulate (the axon) — {@link CaptureNalu}: every raw turn conserved, WAL-backed,
 *     batch-flushed to the SINK on the server tick.
 *   - OUT = coalesce (the dendrite) — a {@link CoalesceGate} projecting live engine state: a
 *     burst of changes collapses to ONE frame via the injected `post` shore (the twin of `flush`),
 *     newest wins, intermediates fade (a dropped intermediate is correct, not a loss).
 *   - SELF-REGULATION (the breathing threshold) — the `flush` is timed; when a `servo` is
 *     composed, each flush nudges the gate toward a latency set-point (gate-tuning's adaptGate),
 *     so the IN threshold tracks load instead of holding a guess. The cell servos ITSELF — no
 *     external valve (the subak rhyme: local-first regulation).
 *
 * Per-vessel shores:
 *   node daemon  : flush=spawn(mine --source ndjson) · reserve=fs-WAL  · post=parentPort
 *   browser spore: flush=idb/relay               · reserve=idb-WAL · post=main-thread
 *   cli          : flush=relay-to-daemon         · reserve=fs-WAL  · post=relay
 *
 * Add a vessel = implement the shores, never rewrite the cell. Pure: zero substrate imports (no
 * node:fs, no child_process) — `now`/timers are universal globals, injectable for tests.
