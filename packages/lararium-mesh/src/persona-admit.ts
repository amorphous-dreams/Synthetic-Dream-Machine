/**
 * persona-admit — the type-blind PERSONA-ADMISSION ceremony: an airgapped, device-to-device capability handoff
 * that admits a PERSONA onto a target vessel, isomorphic to how a hardware wallet moves signing authority.
 *
 * THE RUNG ABOVE DEVICE-ADMIT. `ceremony-core.runDeviceAdmitEdge` admits a DEVICE into a persona-group fleet;
 * this admits a PERSONA onto a VESSEL — one rung up, and TYPE-BLIND: a `PersonaRef` is a prefix + its current
 * key-material, and NOTHING here branches on operator / user / kahu. One code path admits any of them.
 *
 * DUAL-ADMISSION, PER-VESSEL, NEVER-FEDERATES. The ceremony ends with BOTH vessels holding the SAME
 * mutually-signed `JoinRecord`, each written to its OWN per-vessel multitude-view — a conscious hand-composed
 * join, never an automatic sync. This module MINTS and VERIFIES the records; it never writes a store and never
 * touches a wire. The load-bearing invariant lives at the WRITE site (the caller): the admitted-persona list is
 * per-vessel and MUST NOT fleet-sync — a synced "all my faces" record would be almost a global-now-of-the-self,
 * and a captured vessel must spill only the faces actually admitted TO IT. Separation is composed by WHERE a key
 * is admitted, never dissolved by a convenience sync.
 *
 * THE 3-HOP ECDH-SEALED CHOREOGRAPHY (a photographed tabletop stays inert):
 *   1. ENROLL  (B→A, inert)   B mints a FRESH ephemeral X25519 keypair and shows {B_device_id, B_eph_pubkey,
 *                             nonce_B}. No authority — just a pubkey + a challenge. B keeps the ephemeral
 *                             SECRET on-device; no QR ever carries it.
 *   2. GRANT   (A→B, inert)   A mints a persona→vessel delegation transcript, SIGNS it with A's persona PREFIX
 *                             current op-key (rotate-not-resurrect), then ECDH-SEALS it to B's ephemeral pubkey,
 *                             binding nonce_B + a fresh nonce_A. Inert: only the LIVE B holding the
 *                             ephemeral secret opens it; nonce-pinned (no replay onto another offer);
 *                             consume-once + withdrawal-bound (see NO-GLOBAL-NOW below); and even opened it
 *                             delegates ONLY to B's specific device key. NO key-at-rest, no bearer grant — a
 *                             delegation edge, exactly as device-admit ("no secret crosses").
 *   3. ACK     (B→A, inert)   B decrypts, verifies A's signature against the persona's PREFIX head + that nonce_B
 *                             echoes + target, accepts, and SIGNS the JoinRecord with B's device key. A
 *                             verifies the ACK → both hold a matching mutually-signed join record. The 3rd hop is
 *                             load-bearing: dropping it would silent-drop the join from A's log (anti-pono).
 *
 * NO-GLOBAL-NOW (§2a gate-removal v3; the carried `expiry` field itself retired): no step compares a wall
 * clock to anything any more — that read of a cross-party `now` against the OTHER party's stamped field
 * was the gate itself, and it is gone. What actually bounds this ceremony's liveness:
 * CONSUMPTION (an enrollment secret / sent-grant memo is used exactly once, then dropped), WITHDRAWAL (the
 * holder's own causal act drops its own pending state before anything stale can answer it), and the HELD
 * SESSION's own monotonic patience (the CLI process's own `setTimeout` duration, racing a next-hop paste
 * against a SIGINT/SIGTERM — never a `Date.now()` compare, and never read by anything in this file). A "good
 * until" display, if wanted, derives from the held session's own patience, never from a signed field. The
 * prefix-head check reads the caller's LOCAL persona-KEL replica as-of-last-sync. WAX-SEALS-ONLY: the grant is a
 * signature by the persona's own key, never a registrar row. TRACK-CONTRACTS-NEVER-IDENTITIES: a JoinRecord
 * carries key-material + prefixes + nonces only — no name, no email, no device inventory.
 *
 * CRYPTO: X25519 ECDH (ephemeral↔ephemeral) → HKDF-SHA256 → XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD for the seal; Ed25519 for the
 * persona-prefix grant signature + the device ACK signature. All @noble, pure-JS, offline, no wasm, no node-gyp.
