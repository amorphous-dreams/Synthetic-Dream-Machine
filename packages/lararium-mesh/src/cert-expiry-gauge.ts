/**
 * cert-expiry-gauge — how far through its life is a certificate, and when should someone hear about it?
 *
 * WHY THE MESH CARRIES ITS OWN WITNESS. A browser vessel mints its identity key only in a secure context,
 * so a household's glass depends on a live certificate; when that certificate expires, every phone in the
 * house stops booting its vessel at the same moment. And nothing outside this stack will say so first —
 * Let's Encrypt ended expiration notices in 2025 and deleted the stored subscriber addresses, so a renewal
 * that fails quietly produces no warning from anyone until a browser throws an interstitial at a family.
 * The mesh therefore watches its own certificates or nobody does.
 *
 * ── WHY A FRACTION AND NEVER A DAYS-REMAINING COUNT ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The industry's habit is "alert at 30 days left", which was sane while certificates lived 90 days and
 * becomes nonsense as they shorten: at a 45-day lifetime, thirty days remaining means the certificate was
 * issued two weeks ago. A threshold written in days silently turns into a permanent alarm the day validity
 * drops beneath it — the worst failure a monitor has, since a warning that always fires stops being read.
 *
 * So this gauge measures ELAPSED FRACTION of the certificate's own lifetime. That threshold survives a
 * validity change without anyone remembering to revisit it, which matters here because the ground moves
 * on a published schedule: default lifetimes step down, and both day-counts below step down with them —
 * to different places. A fraction reads the same at every step.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * No clock of its own and no I/O. `now` arrives as an argument, so a caller in a causal island supplies
 * the reading it actually holds rather than inheriting a global present, and every band below is a pure
 * function a test can pin exactly.

 *
 *   · the RENEWAL CADENCE — how often the internet must be reached at all. Renewing at two-thirds of a
 *     90-day certificate means touching the network every 60 days, and a household is fully offline in
 *     between. This is the figure that answers //how connected must we be//.
 *   · the GRACE WINDOW — how long after renewal SHOULD have happened before the door actually shuts. On
 *     that same certificate it runs 30 days. This is the figure that answers //how long do we have once
 *     the alarm sounds//, which is the one the witness above exists to protect.
 *
 * Both shrink as lifetimes shorten, and they shrink to different places. Reporting them separately keeps a
 * reader from budgeting a month of slack that was never there.
