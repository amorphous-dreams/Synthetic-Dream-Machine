/**
 * projection-nalu — the pattern integrity behind the three nalus.
 *
 * A sovereign SOURCE's state, carried by a gated wave, FLUSHED to a substrate SINK:
 *   `SOURCE → forward-pass → NALU gate → SINK`
 * `role = capability ≠ platform` — the engine is fixed; the SINK is the injected capability.
 * Three live instances: node lararium → disk · browser lararium → DOM · chat → mempalace.
 *
 * TWO GATE-FAMILIES — CONSERVED, not arbitrary. A three-domain rhyme (
 * physiology · earth-systems · human-systems) shows both families running TOGETHER in one
 * substrate everywhere: a neuron is graded(coalesce) on its dendrites + spiking(accumulate) on its
 * axon; a hydrograph is baseflow(coalesce) + stormflow(accumulate); a ledger zeroes its temporary
 * accounts(coalesce) while rolling permanent ones forward(accumulate). KEEP THEM DISTINCT:
 *
 *   • ACCUMULATE (durable) — heterogeneous, every item conserved, buffer → batch-flush, durable
 *     RESERVE under load, a refractory lockout buying ordering + no-backflow. Biology's name:
 *     "integrate-and-fire". Engine: {@link CaptureNalu} (capture-nalu.ts) — ceiling + spill-to-
 *     reserve + backoff + dead-letter + RRP←reserve refill (latched, demand-mobilized — the
 *     synaptic vesicle-pool rhyme). LAW: whoever holds the reserve holds the backpressure risk.
 *   • COALESCE (transient) — homogeneous frames, NEWEST supersedes, the unflushed FADES (the
 *     decay-envelope — the bell), no reserve (a dropped intermediate is the correct dual of
 *     accumulate's every-one-delivered, NOT a weakness). The refractory lockout must NOT apply
 *     here — it would stall the freshest frame. Engine: {@link CoalesceGate} (below).
 *
 * FACETS the survey named — held as shared vocabulary, NOT all built (YIN; grow on demand):
 *   - flush-REDUCER: deliver | fold/net (settlement netting) | zero (the accounting close) |
 *     supersede-decay (the bell).
 *   - flush-TRIGGER: threshold/pressure | periodic | nested-periodic (= the Aperture ladder, a
 *     colotomic hierarchy of flush-clocks) | incremental/min-viable-chunk | event | deferred-low-load
 *     (sleep consolidation = off-peak compaction).
 *   - fill-adaptive batch (Frank–Starling) · deferral-is-a-priced-trade · negotiated-schedule-
 *     under-contention (subak water-temple — local-first, no global valve).
 * Guards the rhymes named: SUPERCOOLING (full buffer, no nucleation trigger → metastable, work
 * undrained — a gate needs an explicit trigger, never just a full buffer) · HIATUS (the sink is a
 * lossy projection — dropped writes are intrinsic, surface them).
 *
 * Spine vocabulary (biogeochem): pool · flux · reservoir · residence-time (τ = X/I fixes latency).
 *
 * Canon: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/api/lararium/projection-nalu
