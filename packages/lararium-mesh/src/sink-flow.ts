/**
 * sink-flow — compose the CONNECTED half of the gate into one call: feed an event-log through the Sink,
 * tag its class, mint the purple ones. verdict → classifySink(rhythmByPlane, birth) → mintPurpleSink, the
 * crucible floor deriving standing-vs-waived from the feed's own atemporal truth. A cymatic (signal-
 * boundary) candidate DETECTS and mints nothing; a receiver-boundary (purple) one mints at the closure.
 *
 * The residual half — couplingBoundary → project → residual → birth — NOW rides `runBoundaryResidualFlow`
 * below: a directed coupling builds the smooth boundary W*, each frame's residual off it feeds the sink,
 * the ONE dial (ARL₀) calibrates Qα. Still deferred beneath it: the streaming/online pass (track/WRITE)
 * and the operator's rank-k cut.
