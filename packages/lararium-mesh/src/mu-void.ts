/**
 * mu-void — the ONE indistinguishable response the carry shore draws for BOTH "you are caught up"
 * (sync-complete) AND "you are Kapae'd" (denied). Information-minimal by construction: an adversary
 * reading the wire cannot tell nothing-more-to-extract from nothing-more-permitted, because the two
 * paths return BYTE-IDENTICAL Mu (RAW's Chapel-Perilous exit — unasked, void, next question).
 *
 * A Kapae'd presenter draws Mu, NEVER a denial: a denial leaks information (it confirms the ban, names
 * the antigen, opens an argument surface). Mu closes the surveillance shore at the same stroke it closes
 * the immune one. This module is the wire-level artifact of that indistinguishability + the shore a test
 * pins byte-for-byte (mu-void.test.ts).
 *
 * Platform-blind: rides ./crypto only. NO node: imports.
