/**
 * vouch-board — the DOC face of the JOIN axis: the issued `CabalInvite`s a realm has minted, from which the
 * seed-rooted lineage folds. Sibling to `carriage-board` (who carries) and `antigen-board` (who stands
 * banned) under one nexus-pubkey; this board answers WHO VOUCHED FOR WHOM.
 *
 * A vouch RIDES a board precisely because it carries attribution — a cabal-invite names its `voucherDid` in
 * the clear, and an invite nobody can attribute holds nobody to anything. The hosting invite draws the
 * deliberate contrast: it names no voucher, manufactures no social graph, and never gains a board record.
 *
 * ── THE VERIFY RIDES MANDATORY, WHICH IS WHY NO UNVERIFIED READ EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────
 * `vouchDagFromInvites` states its precondition plainly: the invites arrive ALREADY VERIFIED. A reader that
 * handed back whatever tiddlers a board carried would break that precondition silently — and the break cuts
 * deeper than cosmetics: every invite reaching the DAG becomes a VOUCH EDGE, so anyone able to write the
 * board could mint unbounded lineage mass and price their own crossing to nothing. The carriage board can afford a
 * permissive extractor because its forgeries die at a quorum fold downstream; a vouch has no such second gate.
 *
 * So this module exposes ONE read, and that read takes a verifier. No `invitesFromBoard()` stands beside it
 * to reach for by mistake — designation carries authority, the same discipline the rest of the mesh
 * holds. A signature that fails against the `voucherDid` the invite itself names DROPS, and a
 * dropped invite reads as one that never arrived (withhold, never forge).
 *
 * STORAGE CONVENTION (mirrors carriage-board): each invite rides ONE tiddler whose `text` carries the invite
 * JSON. Keyed by realm/voucher/joiner, so distinct vouchers vouching the SAME joiner accrete as the distinct
 * edges they carry, while one voucher re-issuing to one joiner stays idempotent — a voucher cannot inflate its
 * own out-degree by re-minting, which would otherwise dilute its other children for free.
 *
 * ── INVARIANT: NO READ HERE MAY EVER CLAIM COMPLETENESS ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Under no-global-now a replica reads only as-of-its-last-sync, so a tie WITHHELD and a tie merely UNSYNCED
 * generate identically. That equivalence does load-bearing work rather than merely describing a limitation:
 * a custodian who declines to write a tie performs no detectable act, because nobody can distinguish the
 * absence from ordinary partition. Every trust network that survived hostile pressure kept that discretion —
 * to enter a false record, refuse a true one, or silently fail to write — and a board that vouched for its
 * own completeness would hand it away in one sentence.
 *
 * So: no read in this module, and nothing built on one, may report a count as TOTAL, a set as COMPLETE, or a
 * board as current "as of epoch N". `verifiedVouchesFromBoard` hands back what THIS replica happens to hold
 * and vows nothing whatever about what exists. The property costs nothing to keep and no later hand recovers it
 * once spent — a single completeness claim anywhere downstream makes refusal legible again, everywhere.
 *
 * Platform-blind: rides ./base-doc + ./cabal-invite only. NO node: imports — the repo resolution of the board
 * handle lives in the node holder, which hands a read `LarDoc` in.
 * Meme: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/admission-on-a-lineage#/the-standing
