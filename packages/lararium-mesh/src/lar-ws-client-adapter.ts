/**
 * LarWSClientAdapter — the V3 peer transport for a sovereign LEAF actor (platform-blind).
 *
 * The stock `WebSocketClientAdapter` opens its socket and immediately speaks Automerge — no shore for
 * a pre-sync handshake. This subclass interposes the lar:challenge → lar:auth → verdict handshake
 * (operator-peer #actor-parity) on the SAME socket the gate authenticates, THEN hands that
 * authenticated socket to the parent's Automerge machinery. It mirrors the server side, where
 * DaemonAuthGate runs the handshake on the raw socket before emitting "connection" to the adapter.
 *
 * Composition, not a fork: the handshake half (`runPeerHandshake`) and the leaf IDENTITY
 * (`LeafIdentity` — bare-Ed25519 signer + cached ContactCard, no keyhive) inject; the transport
 * composes them. One core, every platform that holds a leaf identity reuses it — node CLI, the
 * always-on relay's leaf legs, AND the browser vessel (the global `WebSocket` + automerge's
 * isomorphic `WebSocketClientAdapter` carry it unchanged across the worker/window boundary).
 *
 * Wire-format note: the handshake speaks JSON text frames; Automerge speaks CBOR binary frames. The
 * two never overlap — the handshake completes (a temporary text pump) before the parent's binary
 * `onMessage` attaches and `join()` fires.
 *
