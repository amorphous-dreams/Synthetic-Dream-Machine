/**
 * delegation-edge — ONE primitive for "a signer vouched for this subject, at this epochCid".
 *
 * The shape kept re-appearing under different names. A fleet-proof binds a published face to the persona
 * root that speaks for it; a dyad-binding binds a vessel×veil relationship into a fleet. Both carry a
 * signer, an epochCid, and a signature over a canonical subject — the same act, twice named, with two
 * byte-builders and two verify paths that could drift apart without anyone noticing.
 *
 * They differ in exactly one thing: WHAT the signature covers. So the subject rides as a caller-supplied
 * record and a DOMAIN separates the uses, which keeps an edge minted for one purpose from verifying at
 * another. One primitive, many bindings, no drift.
 *
 * WHAT AN EDGE DECLINES TO CARRY stays as load-bearing as what it holds. No member list, no device key,
 * no roster — a verifier learns that the named signer vouched for this subject and nothing else, because
 * nothing else was ever put in. The privacy rests on absence rather than on a proof system, which keeps
 * the whole instrument one signature-verify wide.
 *
 * THE EPOCH ORDERS IT, NEVER A TIMESTAMP. A binding roots on a content-addressed epochCid, walkable from a
 * local replica; a wall-clock reading would assert a global instant that a causal island cannot hold.
 *
 * Platform-blind: rides ./crypto only. NO node: imports.
 * Meme: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/mesh/attestation-plane
