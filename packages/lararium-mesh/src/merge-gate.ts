/**
 * merge-gate — the fan-in merge acts as a GATE, not a funnel. Where parallel embedders converge on
 * the single-writer commit, the merge does three jobs at once (the shape secretory-pathway QC ·
 * venous one-way valves · coagulation threshold · ATC point-merge all share): it VALIDATES before
 * the irreversible step, ASSIGNS one-way order, and RECYCLES rejects to a dead-letter lane — it
 * never drops a reject nor blocks the whole stream.
 *
 * It also carries the CONSUME-LICENSE-ON-COMMIT flow (DNA-replication licensing · kinetic
 * proofreading): a fresh content-key holds a license the commit consumes exactly once; a key already
 * consumed skips idempotently (the store's content-hash upsert is the ground-truth backstop, this
 * the fast-path). "Consume-license-on-commit" and the trailing watermark name ONE mechanism — the
 * watermark advance IS the license removal — so this composes capture-drain rather than re-storing
 * licenses (YIN: the drain's resolved-set is the license registry).
 *
 * The PROOFREAD-BEFORE-IRREVERSIBLE law (kinetic proofreading): validation runs BEFORE the commit,
 * so a wrong item leaves the pathway (dead-letter) before the point of no return. The cost is honest
 * — a validation step buys fidelity at a throughput price (named, not free).
 *
 * PURE: functions over (item, licensed-set, validate-shore). The caller draws `licensed` from the
 * drain's committed keys and routes each verdict (commit → the single writer · dead-letter → the
 * ERAD sink · skip → nothing). Meme: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/mesh/merge-gate ·
 * api/projection-nalu (the accumulate family's merge point).
