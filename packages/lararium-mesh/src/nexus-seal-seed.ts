/**
 * nexus-seal-seed — the founding kahu quorum + the ROSTER-FROM-DOC read.
 *
 * ⚠ ONE WORD, SIX JOINTS — and this file holds four of them. `charter` names a FOUNDING ACT, a SEAL
 * LINEAGE (`sealLineage`), a COMPACT, a PRACTICE (`federationPosture` · `joinPolicy` ·
 * `admissionDials`), a FACE, and a ROSTER (`kahu`) — six entities separated not by content but by
 * DIFFERENT CEREMONY, THRESHOLD, RATE and AUTHORITY. A quorum that rotates keys can silently move the
 * admission price, because four amendment costs sit behind one write authority.
 *
 * THE NAMING RULING LANDED (canon `cabal-realm#six-joints`): the word retires to the FOUNDING ACT, and
 * the other joints hold their own names — `SealEpoch`/`verifySealLineage` for the lineage, `RealmGlamour`/
 * `projectRealmGlamour` for the published face, `KahuRoster` for the seats. Two joints collapsed as a gain:
 * the NAME reads as the content-address of the founding act, and the evidentiary MUNIMENT collapses whole,
 * since content-addressing makes a record self-proving natively.
 *
 * SO WHERE `charter` SURVIVES IN AN IDENTIFIER HERE, IT NAMES THE SEATS AND THE SEAL — never the published
 * face, which excludes them by definition. A reader who takes the two for one word publishes a muster roll
 * while meaning to publish a device.
 *
 * WHAT REMAINS FUSED IS AUTHORITY, NOT STORAGE. The disk doc now carries seal · kahu · practice in three
 * fenced blocks at three cadences, so no write clobbers a joint it never meant to touch. But no threshold
 * gates any of those writes, and one operator command still moves kahu and seal together — so the warning
 * above stands undischarged: four amendment costs, one hand.
 *
 * The `bags/nexus` charter DOC carries the AUTHORITY HOME (data-as-authority): the operator SEATS the roster
 * into that doc, and the pure `kapae-antigen` fold/verify read it back through here. This file names the
 * founding quorum's SHAPE (three PersonaGroups, 2-of-3) and folds a loaded doc into the `KahuRoster`
 * the antigen consumes — FAILING CLOSED whenever the doc is absent, unseated, or short of a quorum.
 *
 * THE FOUNDING QUORUM — three founding kahu cryptographic-individuals (persona-policy: each PersonaGroup
 * a cryptographic individual), 2-of-3:
 *   · the founder's declared Handle
 *   · a second declared Handle
 *   · a third declared Handle
 *
 * THE DOC IS THE AUTHORITY. `foundingRoster`/`rosterFromNexusDoc` read a loaded `NexusDoc`, never
 * a hardcoded key-set. Each kahu's ed25519 verifying key is that PersonaGroup's own root-derived key — the
 * operator SEATS it into the doc from the vault (`lares nexus seal seat`), never invents it here. An
 * absent doc, an unseated doc, or a doc short of `threshold` seated keys folds to an EMPTY key-set: any
 * threshold ≥ 1 fails, so the multi-sig verifier IGNORES every antigen entry. That is the correct
 * fail-closed floor — the immune system stays inert (never allow-all) until the founding quorum is
 * cryptographically real in the doc.
 *
 * Platform-blind: rides ./kapae-antigen types + ./crypto only. NO node: imports (the DISK read/write of
 * the doc lives in the node adapter `nexus-doc`, which hands a parsed `NexusDoc` in here).
 * Meme: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/mesh/carry-contract#/the-honest-edges
