/**
 * bag-manifest — a bag's own `meta` declaration: what it carries, who may read it, and where it belongs.
 *
 * THE GAP THIS CLOSES. Three self-describing axes stood defined and none stood SPOKEN: `CapTier` shipped a
 * `DeclaredTierSource` interface that only tests ever implemented, so every bag in production declared no
 * tier and the whole layer read inert; `BagHome` landed with no way for a bag to name its own; and residency
 * lived purely at runtime. A bag knew nothing about itself, and every answer came from whichever call site
 * asked — which is how a Nexus seal ended up in a repository nobody chose.
 *
 * ONE MANIFEST, THREE ANSWERS, and the bag holds them. It rides the same `toml meta` block every meme already
 * carries, at the bag's own root, so a human reads it with the grammar they already read — the manifest is a
 * meme about the bag, which is what a bag's self-description should be.
 *
 * ── NO PATHS, EVER (operator ruling, 2026-08-08) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `repository` names an ID the operator registered, never a directory. A declaration carrying a path would
 * carry one operator's disk layout into an artifact meant to travel: a second operator receiving that bag
 * would inherit a directory naming nothing on their machine. The bag names WHAT; each vessel resolves WHERE.
 * Same split the `lar:` URI law already runs — a name that does not fetch.
 *
 * ── WHAT A DECLARATION CANNOT DO ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It only ever TIGHTENS the cap-tier: `resolveTier` meets the declared value against the structural floor and
 * never returns anything more open, so a manifest that LIES open changes nothing. The home carries no such
 * keystone and cannot — a home names a substrate rather than a permission, and nothing beneath it can check a
 * claim about where bytes ought to rest. So a wrong home is a wrong home, caught by a reader and not by a
 * gate, which is why the parse fail-closes to the one home whose failure recovers.
 *
 * Meme: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/mesh/cap-tier
