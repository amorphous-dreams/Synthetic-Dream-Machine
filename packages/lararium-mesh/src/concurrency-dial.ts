/**
 * concurrency-dial — the self-tuning parallelism limit for the parallel-ingest pool. The AIMD
 * dial the capture research swarm (Loom-Diver) named: let MEASURED LATENCY drive the pool size,
 * never a hardcoded worker count that's wrong on every machine and corpus (Netflix
 * concurrency-limits, TCP congestion control, Little's law).
 *
 * SIBLING to gate-tuning's `adaptGate` (both AIMD around a latency set-point) but the OPPOSITE
 * direction: adaptGate tunes a COALESCE INTERVAL (overload → grow the interval = flush less);
 * this tunes a CONCURRENCY LIMIT (overload → SHRINK the limit = admit less). Same AIMD safety
 * asymmetry — additive-increase probes gently, multiplicative-decrease retreats fast on the first
 * latency signal — different scalar, different sign. Kept its own module so neither dial's
 * direction leaks into the other.
 *
 * THE LAW (AIMD): the set-point is the no-load latency × a tolerance (queue forming = latency
 * risen past it). Below → additive-increase (probe for more parallelism); above → multiplicative-
 * decrease (back off before the latency-collapse cascade). The limit finds itself; no operator
 * knows the true number.
 *
 * PURE + immutable: every observe() returns a new dial. The caller feeds it (latency, inflight)
 * samples from the real pool; the dial owns only the control law.
