/**
 * handle-carriage — decode a carried, self-certifying `HandleCard` (the recogniser's front door).
 *
 * THE CARD IS CARRIED, NEVER FETCHED. A HandleCard is self-certifying — its `sig` verifies against the `nym` it
 * names — so it needs no trusted channel and no reachable authority: a carrier may WITHHOLD it, never forge it.
 * The bytes ride anything a human can hand over — a paste, a QR code held to a screen, a `#card=…` URL fragment,
 * a file on a stick. This is the SAME posture as the boot-invite / device-admit carriage, applied to recognition:
 * it lets a follow admit an unmet nym without the CLI's `--card <file>`, the card arriving by paste instead.
 *
 * The fragment earns its place because a browser never transmits one — the card reaches the vessel and no relay
 * or issuer sees it in transit. This module touches no platform: no `location`, no clock, no network. Same string
 * in, same card out — which is what lets the recognition be tested without a transport.
 *
 * `parseHandleCardCarriage` takes the carriage as a STRING and returns a card or `null`. It only SHAPES the card
 * (domain + the load-bearing fields present) — it does NOT verify the signature or the lineage. That trust gate
 * stays where it belongs: `HandleBook.ingest`, which runs the full TOFU/monotone reader rule and returns a named
 * verdict. WITHHOLD-not-forge: a garbled / absent / wrong-domain carriage returns `null` (the card DID NOT
 * ARRIVE — the operator re-carries it), never a throw, so a human's typo never reads as an attack.
 *
 * Platform-blind: rides ./crypto (base64url) + ./handle-card (the card shape) only. NO node imports — the CLI and
 * the browser both consume it.
