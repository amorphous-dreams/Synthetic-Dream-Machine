/**
 * me-circle — the "me" as a SINGLE-PRINCIPAL REALM: a locus in l-space where a human's
 * multiple Personas (handle-Circles / PersonaGroups) OVERLAP, where ONE Persona takes
 * the blame at a time, and which the embodied human carries through space-time with
 * itself (body + environment).
 *
 * A "me" composes as a single-principal
 * cabal-realm — the SAME realm machinery (cabal-realm.ts), with the multi-principal
 * complexity DEGENERATE to trivial because a single ordering authority holds: you.
 *   · COMPOSITION (the Circle names who counts as me) ⊥ the optional shared substrate (the realm).
 *   · The cabal-realm tie-break (BeeKEM blank-on-merge) orders CONCURRENT DIFFERENT-
 *     principal ops — a me-realm has no different principals, so it never engages.
 *   · The capture-clock detects a minority out-feeding a majority — you cannot capture
 *     your OWN me, so a me-realm resists capture by construction.
 *   · The legitimacy gate (persistence≠legitimacy) dissolves — no contested authority
 *     stands for legitimacy to attach to.
 * So the "me" reuses the cabal-realm keel with the hard parts collapsed to nothing.
 * This module proves the degeneracy carries load (test it with the infrastructure).
 *
 * "One Persona at a time takes the blame" — at any moment EXACTLY ONE PersonaGroup stands
 * ACTIVE / accountable (the Voice-house pattern: one Voice surfaces, named). Switching
 * costs NOTHING — single-principal, you hold the authority over your own slices.
 *
 * The DISCLOSURE dial rides per-persona (composition⊥disclosure): a constellation
 * persona may sit VEILED (no petname) or KNOWN (a petname surfaced for that
 * PersonaGroup — the slice-of-human, never the human). The me-Circle itself carries the
 * human's private constellation: NO global self, disclosed edge-by-edge.
 *
 * Platform-blind: rides ./cabal-realm only. NO node: imports.
 *
 * Meme: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/persona-circle
