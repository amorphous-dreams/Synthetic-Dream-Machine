/**
 * boot-invite — the TRACELESS alpha boot capability: a sealed, single-use token spent-on-boot that leaves NO
 * record on any board and names NO voucher. It gates invite-only alpha the way cabal-invite gates a cabal, but
 * it is the deliberate CONTRAST to it (membership-doctrine #the-invite): a cabal-invite names its `voucherDid`
 * in the clear (attributable, reputation-priced, board-tracked) BECAUSE a cabal is a mutual, consented graph; a
 * boot-invite manufactures NO social graph, so it carries no inviter identity and writes no who-invited-whom
 * edge anywhere.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS, AND IS NOT:
 *   · CARRIED, never fetched — the recipient holds it; no relay and no issuer sees it in transit (admit-carriage's
 *     discipline). It verifies OFFLINE against the Nexus pubkey, so it needs no reachable authority (an isolated
 *     mesh is the only kind that ever really needs an invite).
 *   · SEALED by the NEXUS, not by a person — the signature is the charter/Nexus authority's, IDENTICAL in shape
 *     for every invite it mints, so two invites reveal nothing about who minted which. A random `nonce` makes each
 *     token unique (and is the local burn key); the nonce carries no meaning, only freshness.
 *   · SINGLE-USE, burned LOCALLY. Spend-on-boot: the receiving vessel records the invite's fingerprint in its OWN
 *     local spent-set and refuses a second spend. There is deliberately NO federated burn-registry — a mesh-wide
 *     "which invites are spent" list would re-introduce exactly the tracking the doctrine forbids (and it would
 *     demand a global now the mesh does not have). The burn is a causal-island-local fact.
 *   · WITHHOLD, never forge. A garbled / absent / expired / already-spent invite does NOT throw and does NOT
 *     admit — it means the invite DID NOT ARRIVE, and the vessel then founds its OWN group and stands at the anon
 *     floor (a correct outcome, never an attack; a human's typo must not read as a breach).
 *
 * ── AUTHN ⊥ AUTHZ, AND THE EXPIRY SITS ON THE WRONG SIDE (operator ruling) ────────────────────────────
 * A signature does not expire. What bounds a capability is not its token's age but the SCOPE of the act it
 * authorizes — a specific space, a specific deed, spent once. This invite already carries that scope: it
 * binds to ONE nexus and spends SINGLE-USE, and those two facts do the work the wall-clock `expiresAt` was
 * hired for. The clock adds nothing the binding lacks, and it adds a dependency on an instant that a device
 * owner sets freely — more freely still if they operate the box, since skew is a testing FEATURE there.
 *
 * The expiry therefore reads as DEBT, not design. Retiring it wants the scope stated explicitly enough to
 * stand alone; until then it rides, named.
 *
 * Platform-blind: rides ./crypto only. NO node: imports — the LOCAL spent-set (the burn) lives in the boot host
 * (node: boot-invite-burn; browser: an IndexedDB/localStorage sibling), which this module consults through an
 * injected `isSpent` shore and never reaches itself.
