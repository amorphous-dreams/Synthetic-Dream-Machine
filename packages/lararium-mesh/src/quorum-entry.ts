/**
 * quorum-entry — the ONE canonical byte-image every quorum-signed steward entry signs over.
 *
 * THE SUBTRACTION. The Kapae antigen (`kapae-antigen.ts`) and the members set (`membership-registry.ts`) stand the
 * SAME structure: a causal per-nym CRDT of quorum-signed steward acts. Their signed bytes carry the identical five
 * fields in the identical order — only the `kind` DOMAIN separates them. This module holds that common image once, so
 * the two boards can never drift a field apart while both claiming a quorum verified them.
 *
 * THE DOMAIN STAYS FIRST AND STAYS REQUIRED. `kind` rides as the first canonical field and every caller supplies its
 * own domain constant — that value IS the cross-board separation. An antigen signature and a membership signature
 * cover different bytes because they cover different domains, so no signature raised on one board can ever be
 * re-presented on the other. A shared image with an optional or defaulted domain would dissolve exactly that
 * guarantee; this signature keeps it un-defaultable.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE REFUSES. It carries the BYTES ONLY — never a verdict. The two boards gate differently on purpose:
 * the members set additionally requires the operator's OWN accepts-carriage contract token (`carriageContractBytes`),
 * and the antigen requires no such consent. A shared verifier that forgot that token would turn admission into
 * conscription. The fold and the quorum verdicts stay board-local, deliberately.
