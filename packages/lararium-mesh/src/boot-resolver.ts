/**
 * boot-resolver — tideline-class-aware boot-time required-doc resolver.
 *
 * The split-brain-safe replacement for a create-blank fallback on CANONICALLY-
 * ADDRESSED required docs. It NEVER mints a fresh id for a doc that already
 * carries a canonical url (that births a ghost documentId no peer ever syncs —
 * a fork on the causal island). It branches on which side of the tideline the
 * doc lives, read from automerge-repo's own availability signal (findWithProgress
 * state), never a blind wall-clock race used as an existence oracle:
 *   - hearth-private: never crosses the tideline (social plane, catalog) — no
 *     peer will ever carry it, so an UNAVAILABLE ANSWER is terminal -> FAIL LOUD.
 *     A DEADLINE is a separate verdict and says nothing about the store: the
 *     library never answered, so nothing established damage (`bootFaultVerdict`).
 *   - mesh-shared: rides the magically-federated mesh (base canon, wikis) —
 *     UNAVAILABLE may just mean "not delivered yet" -> WAIT for READY up to
 *     scale-graced patience, then surface a typed StillJoining (never a blank).
 *
 * Stable-bytes origins (the genesis island — reconstructable locally with a
 * shared id) keep their own genesisHandle fallback; they do not route here.
 *
 * Lives in @lararium/mesh so the vessel keel (open-vessel-core) AND both vessel
 * openers reach it — mesh cannot import the node package.

 * the moment a vessel asks for a doc IT JUST WROTE, and a cold founding puts real work in that window:
 * keypair generation, a pre-rotation inception, keyhive wasm init, the ContactCard and the bootstrap,
 * all in one process before the daemon doc is read back.
 *
 * MEASURED: at 3s a relay founding on a cold volume failed to resolve the very doc id it had just
 * seeded — on an idle machine, with no peer involved — and exhausted eight container restarts doing
 * it. The budget was sized for a warm read and spent on a cold found.
 *
 * A local doc that stays unready past this is broken rather than slow, so the ceiling stays low enough
 * to keep failing usefully. `LAR_HEARTH_READY_MS` moves it for a constrained host without a rebuild.

 * THIS VESSEL JUST WROTE: a founding seeds the daemon doc, writes a bootstrap, initialises a wasm
 * module, and asks for the doc back, and an in-flight local write looks exactly like an absent one at
 * the moment of asking.
 *
 * Measured: a hearth died on that reading for the very doc id it had just seeded, on an idle machine
 * with no peers — and a wider deadline could not touch it, because the terminal path never reaches the
 * deadline.
 *
 * So a first sighting buys a grace and a persistent one gets believed — but ONLY where the caller says
 * it expects the doc to be there. A caller that mints on absence treats absence as ordinary and pays
 * nothing for it. A mesh-shared `unavailable` was never terminal and stays that way: the mesh may
 * still deliver.
