/**
 * cabal-invite — the SECOND SIGNAL, and the dial that decides whether a realm demands it.
 *
 * A DreamNet grows from spores in a hostile field (lar:///…/lararium-identity #the-siege-gate). A
 * capability alone reads as SIGNAL-1: cheap, and forgeable at scale by anyone who can mint keys. The
 * VOUCH rides as signal-2, gatekept by an already-licensed member — `rb > c`, the voucher supplying
 * the `r`. Two signals, because a Sybil flood already holds one.
 *
 * THE DIAL, NOT A WALL. The cost of crossing runs MARGINAL, never absolute: a fixed toll reads too cheap
 * for a funded attacker and too dear for an honest newcomer. So this carries a POLICY the operator sets,
 * never a legitimacy answer baked into the code — `cabalRealmJoinGate` stands fenced for exactly that reason,
 * and the fence holds: the answer arrives as a parameter, and the operator turns it.
 *
 *   invite-only — signal-2 REQUIRED. The DreamNet's opening setting: no invite, no crossing.
 *   open        — signal-1 suffices. A later setting, and the same shore.
 *
 * REFUSAL IS ANERGY, NEVER A BAN. A joiner without a vouch does not get destroyed, blacklisted, or
 * remembered as an enemy — it STAYS AT THE FLOOR, hyporesponsive, free to re-present later WITH a vouch.
 * Fail-closed reads stay-at-the-floor. That lets an agent survive a hostile field long enough for
 * someone to vouch for it.
 *
 * THE INVITE IS CARRIED, NEVER FETCHED. A member signs it; it verifies on its own; a carrier may withhold
 * it and can never forge it. It therefore crosses any channel — and needs no reachable issuer, which keeps
 * an invite usable in a mesh cut off for five hundred years.
 * ── THE LEASE ASKS A TENDING QUESTION AND A CLOCK ANSWERS A DIFFERENT ONE ─────────────────────────────
 * The comment below states the intent exactly: a vouch lapses so it can be withdrawn from a mesh the
 * voucher can no longer reach. That question reads WHETHER THE VOUCHER STILL TENDS THIS — and a calendar
 * cannot tell a hand that feeds its vouch daily from one that abandoned it, since both age identically.
 *
 * The honest instrument decays along the GRAPH: has this voucher acted since. A wall clock stands in for
 * it, and stands in badly — worse because a device owner sets that clock freely, and an operator more
 * freely still. Held as DEBT, named here so the next hand sees the substitution rather than inheriting it.
 *
