/**
 * crossroads-cry — what stands on a Nexus crossroads, and what takes it down.
 *
 * ── ONE SHAPE, THREE CONTENTS, TWO AUTHORITIES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Everything that reaches a crossroads arrives as a KŪKALA — a public cry pinned to the board. Nothing is
 * ever removed from it; the board only grows, and what a reader sees is a FOLD over everything cried.
 *
 *   · a NOTICE      — "this name stands here", the ordinary posting (a Handle, a heraldry, a body index).
 *   · a TOMBSTONE   — "I take mine down", the author withdrawing their own cry. Still a cry: withdrawal is
 *                     as public as posting, because a board where things vanish quietly cannot be read.
 *   · a KĀPAE       — "this does not stand here", the Nexus refusing. Remove-wins, and it shadows the
 *                     SUBJECT rather than one cry, so re-pinning does not resurrect it.
 *
 * The two authorities never blur. An author governs only their OWN cries — a tombstone over someone else's
 * notice does nothing at all, and the fold says so by ignoring it rather than by trusting the writer. The
 * Nexus governs the board: a kāpae outranks any cry, before or after.
 *
 * ── WHY KĀPAE MUST DEFEAT A LATER CRY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Two islands with no shared now cannot agree on which act came first. If a later cry could outlive a
 * kāpae, anyone refused at the Gate re-pins from a partition and stands again — the refusal would hold only
 * against people who accept it. Remove-wins is what makes a Gate a Gate rather than a request, and canon
 * already rules it this way for membership (kāpae: remove-wins, and re-linking a cut reads irreversible).
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY LEAVES OUT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * No act is performed here and no authority is checked against a key — this folds a board that has already
 * been written. Who may sign a Nexus kāpae is the charter quorum's business, and a cry's signature is the
 * board writer's; the fold reads the record and reports what stands.
 *
 * ── ▶ SUSPENDED, AND FURTHER OUT THAN IT LOOKS ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Nothing calls this fold either, and here the gap is larger: NOTHING WRITES A CRY. The board this reads
 * has no producer at all — a Handle announce is ruled to land as a kūkala (persona-policy#the-announce-is
 * -a-kukala) and the announce does not yet write one. So the work ahead is the BOARD, never the wiring;
 * a fold over an empty board reports an empty board, correctly and pointlessly.
 *
 * Kept standing rather than deferred, because the fold is the part with the subtle law in it — two
 * authorities that never blur, and a kāpae that must defeat a later cry — and that reasoning is cheaper
 * to hold in code with its tests than to re-derive when the board arrives.
