/**
 * mesh-coupling — WIRES the mesh sensorium's child sensoria (who · authority · flow) together:
 * the "transfer-entropy read on demand" the FLOW coupling-lobe reserves (sensorium.ts — coupling
 * is a BASE cap: dumb child-edges, the TE read elsewhere; THIS is elsewhere). It computes the
 * directed coupling matrix between the children's signals + reads whether they stay SOVEREIGN.
 * R informs (never drives); the partition is watched (never declared).
 *
 * THE PHANTOM GUARD, native to a THREE-child mesh: with exactly who/authority/flow, each ordered
 * pair conditions on the THIRD child — conditional TE that removes the common-driver phantom (if
 * FLOW drives both WHO and AUTHORITY, conditioning on FLOW dissolves the spurious WHO↔AUTHORITY
 * edge). For n≠3 it falls back to effective (pairwise) TE — multivariate-TE for larger meshes is
 * a flagged refinement, not silently pretended.
 *
 * Platform-blind: composes ./transfer-entropy + ./partition-monitor. NO node: imports; the node
 * side reads each child's aggregate signal from its dir and hands it here.
 * Meme: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/mesh/who (the mesh sensorium tree)
