/**
 * sink — the feed-it-emerges Sink accumulator: one event-log per candidate that COMPOSES the three sink
 * order-parameters (birth ⊕ standing ⊕ clock) into one living organ. "Just feed it" — ingest (plane,
 * agreement, value?) events (ordered by island ordinal, NEVER a wall-clock timestamp) and the Sink derives:
 *   · support        — accreted event count (the nucleus "size");
 *   · planeSignals   — per-plane mean agreement (the cross-plane drive);
 *   · rhythm         — the agreement FIRST-DIFFERENCE v_i = a_i − a_(i-1) (v_0 = 0) by default, an explicit
 *                      `value` overriding it; the marquee signal that feeds the clock + rigidity;
 *   · supersaturation — recent-window agreement ÷ a BASELINE (EMA), the ratio self-calibrated against a
 *                       BEAT-DERIVED window; a default window applies only in holdover. A burst reads > 1
 *                       (lowers r*), a lull reads < 1.
 *
 * The clock drives the rest (C1): recoverClock({rhythm}) recovers the beat ONCE; that beat sizes the
 * supersaturation window, and rides into temporalRigidity as knownPeriod so the base period gets detected a
 * single time — clock + rigidity read ONE beat. nucleate({support, planeSignals, arrivalRate, planeCorrelation})
 * decides birth; temporalRigidity decides standing. The shore the QA named — a shared candidate noun bridging
 * the scalar gate and the array-signal rigidity — closes here: every organ reads projections of ONE event-log.
 *
 * A constant (plane, agreement)-only feed carries NO first-difference rhythm → holdover → it never STANDS as
 * a sink (born may still fire on cross-plane support, but standing stays provisional).
 *
 * STILL feed-it-emerges TODO (honest): the birth threshold rides γ (defaulted, not yet population-calibrated),
 * the rigidity threshold stays fixed (not yet a shuffle-null), and `born` reduces to "≥2 independent planes +
 * agreement" until γ calibration + support-decay land. Now RESOLVED here: supersaturation self-adapts against
 * the beat-derived window, and the recent-window / baseline-alpha knobs emerge from the recovered beat rather
 * than a chosen constant. The next pass carries γ + the null-thresholds + windowed support.
