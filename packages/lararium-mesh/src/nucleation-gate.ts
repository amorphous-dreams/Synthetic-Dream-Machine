/**
 * nucleation-gate — a candidate sink NUCLEATES not on accreted support alone (the frequency trap) but
 * when support crosses a CRITICAL-NUCLEUS barrier. Classical nucleation theory gives a cluster's free energy
 *   ΔG(r) = −(4/3)π·Δg·r³ + 4π·γ·r²
 * fights a VOLUME gain (∝ r³, the driving force Δg) against a SURFACE cost (∝ r², the price γ of positing
 * a bounded standing entity — the naming/index cost a frequency count cannot see). The sum has a SADDLE at
 *   r* = 2γ/Δg          (the critical radius)
 *   ΔG* = 16π·γ³/(3·Δg²) (the barrier height — returned as telemetry; see NOTE below)
 * Below r* the candidate DISSOLVES; above r* it self-sustains (BORN). γ enters the barrier cubically →
 * cheap naming (UUID-first) lowers r* everywhere; r* ADAPTS to supersaturation (a burst raises Δg →
 * lowers r* → nucleates sinks a static threshold would miss; an unfed island's Δg→0 so r*→∞, never born).
 *
 * The DRIVE Δg = mean per-plane agreement × (effective INDEPENDENT PLANES − 1) × supersaturation:
 *   · CROSS-PLANE agreement, not single-plane frequency — the `(effectivePlanes − 1)` factor makes a LONE
 *     plane yield ZERO drive (never born), enforcing the cross-plane thesis STRUCTURALLY, not by comment;
 *   · effectivePlanes = n/(1+(n−1)ρ) on the SIGNED mean correlation ρ (Kish effective sample size),
 *     floored at ρ ≥ −1/(n−1)+ε so anti-correlated planes count as MORE independent (corroboration) yet
 *     never drive to infinity — lockstep/derived planes (ρ→1) collapse to ONE effective plane.
 *
 * ONTOLOGY NOTE: "effective planes" here NAMES independent corroborating SIGNAL STREAMS (the counterpoint
 * no-parallel-fifths rhyme: lockstep lines collapse to one). This stays DISTINCT from the house's "Voice"
 * (a Kahea-able handle on move-potentials/functors in l-space) — do NOT conflate; the code never says "voice".
 *
 * NOTE (honest POSIWID): this function runs PURE + STATELESS — it decides BIRTH from one candidate's
 * (support, plane-agreements, arrivalRate). It holds NO cross-call state, so it cannot itself "reap"
 * sub-critical recurrers or ripen sinks; and `barrier` rides as telemetry but does NOT gate `born`
 * (birth rides the r* radius comparison). Metastable reaping, Ostwald ripening, decay, and the self-adaptive
 * calibration of γ / supersaturation-baseline / thresholds all ride the feed-it-emerges Sink accumulator
 * (the next-phase redesign), never this function.
