/**
 * arl-dial — ONE interpretable operator dial for the whole gate: ARL₀ = "one false sink per N frames".
 * The nine-wave braid ruled every threshold self-emergent from ONE scalar (α = 1/ARL₀); this exposes that
 * dial. α = the per-frame false-positive budget; the cross-plane AND (birth needs ≥2 nodes) then refracts
 * a per-node α to the conjunction ≈ α^k, so a per-node α of 1/ARL₀ runs conservative at the birth level —
 * a matched-dial names α_node = ARL₀^(−1/k). `alphaNode` rides EXPOSED-but-unconsumed on purpose: controlLimit
 * reads the conservative per-frame α, and the birth-matched swap awaits the shuffle-null that measures the
 * ACTUAL birth rate under plane correlation (the open ruling lives at sink-flow's α wire — never swap by fiat).
 * Downstream reads α (controlLimit) + basinRadius (the minter's dedup/grow/birth radius); the deeper
 * self-emergence rides the deferred sprint — basinRadius from the closure-distance null · γ back-solve ·
 * Mondrian per-island calibration · the ACI drift-servo (Gibbs-Candès online α-adaptation) · the DDSketch/
 * DSPOT streaming held-null · the shuffle/surrogate-null harness (entrainment-conditional for rigidity).
 * A static derive-once dial today; the deferred sprint makes each threshold EMERGE. This replaces the
 * scattered α=0.05 + quantum-0.1 constants with one number now (γ + rigidity await the null-calibration).
