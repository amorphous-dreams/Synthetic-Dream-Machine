/**
 * persona-petname — the PRIVATE own-persona pet-name layer + the multitude-view over the whole self.
 *
 * ZOOKO'S TRIANGLE, own side (canon: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/persona-policy). The GLOBAL name of
 * a persona stays the pubkey — the veiled-user key the persona-HD tree derives (persona-identity), secure-
 * and-decentralised because it IS the key. MEMORABILITY rides a LOCAL name the human keeps: on the OWN side
 * this pet-name map (a persona → a human's private label for it), on the OTHER side the handle-book (a nym →
 * the recogniser's label for someone ELSE). This module holds the own side ONLY.
 *
 * NEVER PUBLICLY FEDERATES — it FLEET-SYNCS among the human's own vessels. The pet-name map names a human's
 * OWN faces to THEMSELVES — "work", "the-guru", "the throwaway". It rides the private inside of the private
 * Vault (persona-circle#the-vault): a label the human puts on their own compartment, which their own devices
 * SHOULD carry and which no peer outside the fleet ever reads. The boundary the module holds runs PUBLIC, not
 * cross-vessel: nothing here writes to a board, and the multitude-view reads the pet-name locally, never
 * announces it.
 *
 * THE BINDING LAW. Only a PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED HANDLE binds a PersonaGroup to a public glamour (persona-glamour
 * mints that card; who-face announces it). A pet-name string carries no such binding and MUST NOT reach a
 * federating document by any path — a private label that lands on a board publishes a face the human never
 * announced. The chosen string MAY match a glamour word-for-word; the DECLARING act, never the string, makes
 * it public.
 *
 * DEVICE-FLEET (SURFACED, not blocking). A human's own PersonaGroup rides several of their own vessels; the
 * pet-name map SYNCS across that private vessel-pool, private-federated over a PRIVATE BAG in the
 * PersonaGroup. That cross-pool sync rides the device-fleet, which is not yet built (blocks on Beelay). So
 * the shore stays LOCAL-FIRST: the store persists per-vessel today, and a future fleet adapter wraps the
 * same `OwnPersonaPetnameStore` shape over a private bag — the interface never moves, the sync drops in.
 *
 * Meme: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/persona-policy
