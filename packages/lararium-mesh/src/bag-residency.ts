/**
 * Bag residency — how a vessel STOWS what it carries (`BagStowage`).
 *
 * Stowage names the discipline this module performs: a vessel decides what rides to hand and what
 * strikes down into the hold, and re-arranges that as the voyage runs. Cargo wanted soon stows
 * accessible; cargo for the last port goes deep. Here a touched grain rides hot, an idle one cools,
 * and the caps bound how much stays broken out at once — the same discipline under its own name.
 *
 * `bag` carries TW5's meaning unchanged (bags + recipes, the upstream house's own load-bearing
 * myth), so a reader arriving from TiddlyWiki reads this surface without translation.
 *
 * ONE FILE, ONE QUESTION. This module answers how a vessel STOWS what it holds, and nothing else. A
 * federation-authority doctrine once shared its file and shared none of its types, functions, or
 * imports — a single name over two unrelated questions, which is the shape that lets a reader carry an
 * assumption from one half into the other.
 *
 * Model: a two-state thermal axis in ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi — wela (hot) / anu (cold) — plus an orthogonal
 * pin flag. The `warm` (mahana) middle tier stands cut: a suspended Worker still holds its heap, so
 * warm never shed the memory this model exists to bound.
 *
 * Canon: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/api/residency-tiers

 *   anu  ("cold") — torn down; URL known, doc not loaded; resume by spawn + `ea`.
 *
 * TWO states only. The `warm` (mahana) middle tier was cut: a suspended Worker
 * still holds its heap, so warm did NOT shed the memory this model exists to
 * bound, and it had no actor-system precedent (the Orleans/Akka two-state
 * virtual-actor model). Reintroduce only behind a measured resume-cost problem
 * AND a real memory-shedding suspend (isolate evicted, handle-cache retained).
 *
 * `pinned` is NOT a temperature — it is an ORTHOGONAL flag ("exempt from
 * cooling"), kupono-aligned with Orleans `[KeepAlive]` / Android foreground.
 * See `isPinned()`. A pinned bag is wela and stays wela.
 *
 * Transition VERBS wear Hawaiian (the-lararium-hud.md doctrine):
 *   - `hoʻoanu`  ("to cool") — wela → anu. `IslandMsg_HooAnu` drives the island
 *     side; `cool()` drives this bookkeeping side.
 *   - `hoʻowela` ("to heat") — anu → wela. `touch()` heats a bag back to live;
