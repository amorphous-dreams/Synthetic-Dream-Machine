/**
 * veil-crossing — the promote gesture on the veil: crossing from anon (veiled) into a
 * named PersonaGroup is a CHOICE the vessel makes per crossing (operator's recorded design,
 * mempalace planning talk-story):
 *
 *   · LIFT — keep the anon key, link it, BRING THE REPUTATION. Linkable: the anon key IS
 *     the persona key, so the anon past WELDS to the persona (every observer who watched
 *     the anon key can now stitch "that anon = this persona"). Right for own-devices /
 *     momentary-anon; the reputation carries.
 *   · HOLD — REFOUND: present a FRESH key at a NEW hardened path, with NO back-link. The
 *     anon footprint has nothing to weld to. Right for a lived-public anon that wants to
 *     enter a private persona WITHOUT dragging its public history in.
 *
 * This is the owed cross-place unlinkability + the canon's Chaum move
 * (persona-circle#disclosure: "graduate by transferring a credential to a fresh
 * pseudonym, never by proving sameness, so the veil can re-close on a new key").
 *
 * WHAT "severed" MEANS, precisely: HOLD severs the PUBLIC link — a
 * wire-watcher cannot derive/stitch the refound key from the anon key, because all-hardened
 * SLIP-0010 derivation is immune to public cross-path linkage (persona-hd, 28/28 vectors),
 * and the refound reuses NO key (no signature-reuse linker). The SEED holder (you) still
 * knows both — severance is against the observer, not against yourself. The ZK-vouch that
 * lets a refound carry "blessed by someone who knew the anon" WITHOUT a public link stays
 * the adjacent arc (deferred, operator's future).
 *
 * Platform-blind: rides ./persona-identity only. NO node: imports.
