/**
 * recovery-keel-core — the founding-split + recover-readmit FLOWS (platform-blind).
 *
 * The lone-citizen truth: the device-share dies WITH the device, so recovery cannot ride it. A founding
 * split is 2-of-3 {device, recorded-code, escrow-peer} — normal life uses any two, but a drowned device
 * recovers from {recorded-code (the citizen wrote it down) + escrow (a peer relays it)}. Neither party
 * recovers alone: the recovery quorum IS the impersonation quorum, and it needs both (recovery-share
 * enforces this at the TYPE wall — a single-custodian set can never construct a Quorum).
 *
 * The crypto primitives already sit in mesh (recovery-share: splitToShares / assembleQuorum /
 * reconstructFromQuorum / encodeShareBytes). Only the FLOW lifts here, over two injected shores:
 *   · the PersonaVault — supplies the root seed to split + the sealed device-share store,
 *   · the readmit runner — the keyhive edge-signing step, injected because keyhive DEPENDS ON mesh
 *     (mesh importing keyhive would cycle). The core reconstructs the branded ReadmissionSecret and hands
 *     it to the runner; the platform binds the concrete `runReadmitEdge`. Dependency inversion keeps the
 *     recovery flow keyhive-blind while the branded secret stays the one door into re-admission.
