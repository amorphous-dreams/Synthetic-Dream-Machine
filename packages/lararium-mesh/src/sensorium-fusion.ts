/**
 * sensorium-fusion — the COHOMOLOGICAL GATE. The consistency module reads H⁰ (the scalar
 * consistency-radius = agreement). This module reads the SECOND invariant, H¹ — the cohomological
 * obstruction that tells apart two categorically different disagreements, and GATES a sheaf-Laplacian
 * fusion on it:
 *
 *   H¹ = 0 — the EPISTEMIC no-global-now. The li-planes don't glue *yet*, but nothing forbids a global
 *            section — a pairwise-consistent structure with a common refinement is reconcilable. FUSE:
 *            diffuse the plane values toward H₀ = ker(sheaf Laplacian) — the consensus a global section
 *            would carry — via a CHEBYSHEV polynomial of the sparse Laplacian (order-K dial, sparse
 *            matvec only, no eigendecomposition).
 *   H¹ ≠ 0 — the ONTOLOGICAL no-global-now. A genuine COCYCLE: the planes agree on every pairwise
 *            overlap yet NO global section exists (their pairwise agreements admit no common witness —
 *            the classic hollow-triangle obstruction). Each plane's reading stays true; there is nothing
 *            to average toward. DO NOT FUSE — surface the obstruction as SIGNAL, route to Talk-Story,
 *            never average it away. The reconciliation cost `R*_sem = log₂ dim H¹` (Thomas–Chen) rides
 *            the wire as the federation/mana rating axis: how expensive to reconcile these planes.
 *
 * ── WHERE THE SUBTLETY LIVES (honest note, per the build charge) ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * H¹ = ker(δ¹)/im(δ⁰) is plain linear algebra over an abelian cochain complex — but WHICH complex
 * carries the contextuality class is the subtle part, and the naive choice is WRONG:
 *
 *   The per-unit VALUE cellular sheaf (vertices = planes, stalks = ℝ^domain, edge restrictions =
 *   coordinate projection onto the overlap) has FREE, surjective restriction maps. On the hollow
 *   triangle (three planes pairwise-overlapping, empty triple overlap) its H¹ computes to 0 — every
 *   1-cochain is a coboundary, because each edge's overlap value is independently reachable from its
 *   vertex. So the value-sheaf's cellular H¹ CANNOT see contextuality. (Proof in the test suite.)
 *
 *   The obstruction is TOPOLOGICAL, not value-continuous: it lives in the simplicial cohomology of the
 *   AGREEMENT NERVE — the Čech nerve of the cover by "plane-domains where the planes agree". An edge
 *   sits in the nerve when two planes OVERLAP and AGREE there (they pairwise-glue); a triangle fills in
 *   when three planes share a common WITNESS unit (a nonempty triple overlap). H¹ of that nerve (ℝ
 *   coefficients) is a genuine ker(δ¹)/im(δ⁰), and it is NONZERO exactly on a cocycle: pairwise-agreeing
 *   planes whose agreements have no common witness — the ontological cell. This is the honest
 *   buildable-now reading. A value-continuous contextuality (an obstruction that survives with a common
 *   witness present) would need the stalks constrained to an affine SUBSPACE / a local system with a
 *   twist; our free [0,1] saliences impose no such subspace, so the nerve topology is the whole story.
 *
 * The two invariants share ONE δ⁰ family and ONE overlap/restriction structure (the consistency module's
 * comparison stalk + domains), so the gate reuses that machinery rather than re-deriving it:
 *   • the H¹ gate reads the agreement-nerve simplicial cohomology (contextuality → fuse/hold-open);
 *   • the fusion diffuses over the cellular sheaf Laplacian L₀ = δ⁰ᵀδ⁰ of the co-observation coupling,
 *     whose kernel H₀ IS the consensus (a global section), reached by Chebyshev heat diffusion.
 *
 * Cosheaf (ki) planes are REFUSED here, exactly as the consistency module refuses them — a flow read
 * through a contravariant restriction is the silent corruption (li-ki-integrities.md#crucible-tested).
 *
 * PORT-STATUS — this organ stands the CONCEPT-WITNESS + the TS↔py parity oracle; the production H¹
 * compute ports to py (the RUN arc). py counterparts EXIST: `predictive_coding.py` (the F primitive) +
 * `bands.py`. OWED in py: THIS H¹ gate · the EFE keystone · the bench strands.
