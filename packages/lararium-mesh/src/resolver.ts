/**
 * `lar:` URI resolution for the Lararium carrier spine — TOPOLOGY ONLY.
 *
 * It answers what a URI NAMES: its root, its child path, whether the shape carries a caps root, and
 * whether anything on disk could back it. It answers nothing about WHERE — and that separation follows
 * the scheme's own law, since `lar:` names and never fetches.
 *
 * ── WHY NO DISK MAPPING LIVES HERE ANY LONGER ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * An earlier shape carried one: `ha.ka.ba/lares/{path}` → `packages/lares-core/memes/{path}.mem`, and a
 * matching rule for the engine packages. The corpus then moved into `bags/`, those trees stopped
 * existing, and the mapping kept computing paths that named nothing. Nothing joined them — no production
 * caller ever read the fields — so the rot surfaced nowhere and the header went on instructing every
 * reader, human or agent, to look in a directory the repo had deleted.
 *
 * A mapping nobody joins cannot go stale LOUDLY; it can only mislead quietly. So it went, rather than
 * getting re-pointed at `bags/` and inviting the same silence next time the corpus moves.
 *
 * DISK RESOLUTION RIDES THE CARRIER WALK instead (`listCarriers` over a bag directory), where a wrong
 * path fails immediately and visibly against a real filesystem.
 *
 * NOTE: `lararium-mesh` stays isomorphic — no `fs`, `path`, or `process` imports. The host reads files.
 *
 * Resolution policy:
 * - AGENTS, LARES, README → virtual until expressed under the lares bag
 * - a stable-tuple root with a corpus scope → tuple-file (a carrier MAY back it; the host decides)
 * - any other shape → virtual (wiki-only)
