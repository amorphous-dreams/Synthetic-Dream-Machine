/**
 * who-sensory-shore — the CLASP where the WHO-plane (agency) meets the WHO sensorium (perception).
 * The two halves of the self, joined on the parallel session's StreamAdapter + sensorium
 * foundations, through THREE message-shapes (the signal-shore contract):
 *
 *   ① EMIT     — WHO-plane events → sensorium frames (whoStreamAdapter). The ladder/immune ops
 *                emit WhoEvents; the sensorium's bands/content planes sense them.
 *   ② CONSUME  — the sensorium's derived quantities → the immune-read's SignalPattern (Signal-1,
 *                the actor's own threat-pattern).
 *   ③ CORROBORATE — the immune-read's Signal-2 (an independent neighbor's flag) IS a mesh-coupling
 *                R-edge INTO who: does authority's or flow's stream INFORM the who-threat above a
 *                threshold? (The insight — the neighbor-signal is the coupling plane —
 *                made literal.)
 *
 * Platform-blind: rides ./stream-adapter (their contract) + ./immune-read + ./mesh-coupling +
 * ./veil-ladder types. NO node: imports.
