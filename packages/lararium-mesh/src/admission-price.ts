/**
 * admission-price — the gate as a PRICE, composed from the parts that stand.
 *
 * NOTHING NEW GETS INVENTED HERE. `lineage-rank` supplies the seed-rooted vouch mass; `conviction-dial`
 * supplies the 1Hive convex bar and the half-life decay; `capture-reading` supplies the discipline this
 * file obeys. The one thing missing was the shore between them, and a shore is all this is.
 *
 * WHY A PRICE AND NOT A PREDICATE. A boolean gate has a CLIFF, and no parameter smooths a cliff — so
 * "invite-only now, open protocol later" could never be a dial while admission stayed a yes/no. Make it a
 * COST and the same fold spans both: set the cost of an UNRANKED applicant to unpayable and the mesh is
 * invite-only; set it finite and the protocol is open. One number, no rewrite.
 *
 * WHY THE COST RISES WITH CONCENTRATION. A vouch DAG where vouching costs nothing is positive feedback: the
 * founders' descendants hold the mass, they vouch the most, and the lineage collapses into an oligarchy of
 * the early. The 1Hive curve is the stabiliser — `ρ·S / (1−α) / (β − r)²` — cheap while power stays
 * dispersed, asymptotically IMPOSSIBLE as one cluster nears the operator's ceiling β. It is Turrigiano's
 * multiplicative renormalisation and Ogilvie's cartel warning answered by the same convex wall: THE GATE AND
 * THE CARTEL ARE THE SAME MACHINE, so the machine must price the cartel out of itself as it forms.
 *
 * WHY THE VOUCHER'S BUDGET IS SCARCE AND NOT POLICED. The germinal centre never picked a threshold: it made
 * help LIMITING, so admission became a rank against siblings rather than a cutoff cleared. Mass conservation
 * in `lineage-rank` gives us that for free — a voucher's score SPLITS across everyone it vouches for, so
 * vouching for one more IS vouching less for everyone else. The co-pay falls out as a CONSERVATION LAW.
 *
 *     YOU PAY WHEN YOU VOUCH. NEVER WHEN THEY BETRAY.
 *
 * That distinction is load-bearing, and it is what makes the co-pay survivable at all: charging a voucher
 * for a betrayal requires the NEWS OF THE BETRAYAL TO ARRIVE, and a negative fact cannot be made to arrive
 * (CRLs, OCSP, PGP revocation, CT's gossip layer, and the Maghribi coalition of the 11th century, all dead
 * in the same place). A conservation law needs no messenger.
 *
 * VERDICT-FREE, like the reading it mirrors. This returns a PRICE and the parts it was built from. It does
 * not admit anyone. The caller decides what it can afford — and an operator who wants the cliff back can
 * always compare the price to a wall of their own choosing.
 *
 * Design-of-record: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/admission-on-a-lineage#/the-standing — the limiting
 * resource stands SELF-STANDING; the voucher pays by dilution and the applicant brings nothing.
