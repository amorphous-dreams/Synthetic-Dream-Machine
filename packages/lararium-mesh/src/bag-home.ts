/**
 * bag-home — WHERE a bag's bytes rest, as SELF-DESCRIBING DATA (operator-ruled 2026-08-07).
 *
 * A bag already declares two things about itself, and neither answers this one:
 *   · `CapTier`               — WHO may read it (veil ⊂ personagroup ⊂ contract ⊂ public).
 *   · `ResidencyTemperature`  — WHETHER it stands loaded (wela / anu).
 * Both leave the home open, and a single pair proves the axis stands apart: the canon memes and the Nexus
 * seal read as equally public, and they want OPPOSITE homes — one belongs in a tracked tree a clone carries,
 * the other must never enter one. No tier tells them apart, and no temperature does.
 *
 * ── THE THREE HOMES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   · "repository" — rests in a CONFIGURED source-control repo. A clone carries it, its history is the
 *                    point, and a reviewer reads its diffs. Canon, memes, seeds.
 *   · "hearth"     — rests in PER-OPERATOR state. No clone carries it; the operator backs it up and hands
 *                    it on by their own act. Identity, the Nexus seal, the follow-graph, the persona names.
 *   · "ley"        — rests NOWHERE durable. It exists while the mesh carries it, and a vessel holds a
 *                    replica rather than an original. The DreamNet-synced planes.
 *
 * A Lar binds to a PLACE, never to a family: when the family moves, the Lar stays. `hearth` names that, and
 * the corpus reads as the family's luggage.
 *
 * ── FAIL-CLOSED TO HEARTH, AND THE ASYMMETRY IS THE POINT ────────────────────────────────────────
 * A bag declaring nothing — or declaring something torn — reads `hearth`. Of the three, only `hearth` can be
 * wrong quietly: a bag that should have ridden the repository merely fails to be shared, and an operator
 * notices. The other two fail LOUDLY in the directions that hurt — a mis-defaulted `repository` writes a
 * private thing into a tracked history that may already be pushed, and a mis-defaulted `ley` gives a durable
 * thing no durable home at all. So the default takes the recoverable failure.
 *
 * ── WHAT ENFORCES IT, AND WHAT DOES NOT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `resolveBagHomeDir` IS the enforcement: it holds the only mapping from a declared home to a directory, so a
 * caller that asks it where a bag lives cannot land the bag anywhere else. The bound, stated plainly: a
 * caller that JOINS ITS OWN PATH bypasses this module entirely and nothing here can stop it. That is exactly
 * how the Nexus seal came to sit inside a repository — a call site read `LAR_BAGS ?? join(root, "bags")` and
 * never asked. So this reads as a mechanism with a NAMED bypass rather than a guarantee, and the standing
 * discipline runs: a new bag asks this module for its directory, and a review of a hand-rolled `join(…bags…)`
 * asks why.
 *
 * `repository` additionally names a substrate this module cannot supply — a REGISTERED repo. A bag names an
 * id; the operator maps ids to roots on their own vessel; an unregistered id REFUSES rather than guessing a
 * tree, because guessing is the failure it exists to prevent. No path ever rides a bag's own declaration.
 *
