/**
 * rendezvous-path — where a daemon and its clients meet, inside the budget the kernel sets.
 *
 * NODE-ONLY, AND REACHED BY SUBPATH ALONE (`@lararium/mesh/rendezvous-path`). This reads `node:crypto`
 * and the process uid, and a Unix-domain rendezvous names nothing a browser holds — so it stays OFF the
 * isomorphic barrel, which the browser vessel loads entire and would therefore breach at LOAD rather
 * than at call. The hull guard enforces this; it caught this module's first siting.
 *
 * ── A RENDEZVOUS IS NOT A RESIDENCE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The data homes answer WHOSE IT IS: the spirits' substrate under `lares`, the house's shelf under
 * `lararium`, split so a wipe reaches exactly one and never the other. A socket answers a different
 * question — WHERE DO TWO PROCESSES MEET — and answers it under a hard limit the other question has never
 * heard of: `sockaddr_un.sun_path` caps near 104 bytes.
 *
 * Siting the socket beside the data made the second question inherit the first's depth. A root three
 * directories deeper than expected then takes the rendezvous down while everything else about the vessel
 * stands: measured as `listen EINVAL` on a scratch root, with the daemon serving throughout and the CLI
 * spending a 120-second deadline against a bind that had already refused.
 *
 * ── WHY NOT `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` — OPERATOR RULING, 2026-08-23 ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * "Herms/larariums at all scales serve as civic infrastructure": a lararium daemon MUST survive its
 * operator logging out. `/run/user/$UID` is destroyed at logout by contract, so a rendezvous that must be
 * found alive tomorrow cannot live there — whatever its length advantage. The practice in the field splits
 * along precisely this axis rather than along modern-vs-legacy, and this house has answered it.
 *
 * ── WHY THE NAME DERIVES FROM THE ROOT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A shared short directory would be WORSE than a deep one: two throwaway roots would collide on a single
 * socket, and a rehearsal would reach the real machine's daemon while believing itself isolated — the exact
 * failure the mempalace installer already carries a warning about. Deriving the name from the root keeps
 * one root answering to one socket, and two roots never meeting.
 *
 * The derived name reads opaque, and that costs nothing a printed path does not repay: gpg answers the same
 * problem with `gpgconf --list-dirs` rather than a guessable name, and a resolved path a tool PRINTS beats
 * any naming scheme a human has to reconstruct.
