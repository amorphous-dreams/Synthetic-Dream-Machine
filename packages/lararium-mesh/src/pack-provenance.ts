/**
 * pack-provenance — the aside map that records which PACK file a tiddler came
 * from, so a bundle round-trips without smearing metadata on the members.
 *
 * A "pack" names a multi-tiddler file (a `.json` array · `.multids` ·
 * `text/vnd.tiddlywiki-multiple`): ONE file that yields MANY tiddlers. TW5 loses
 * these on save-back (its manual round-trip friction); our superset keeps the
 * membership ASIDE, TW5's own way — a single system tiddler `$:/config/
 * OriginalTiddlerPaths`, a JSON map { memberTitle: packFilePath }, exactly the
 * shape TW5's boot writes (boot.js:2369). The ingested tiddlers stay BYTE-CLEAN
 * (no injected fields), which keeps an upstream PR diff clean.
 *
 * This module holds ONLY the pure map operations (parse · query · record ·
 * forget). Where the map LIVES (a writable CRDT bag for a dropped bundle, or a
 * local blob layer for an imported wiki) and WHO writes it rides in the callers.

// which member's CONTENT moved. Presence-tracking (adds/drops) alone lets a member
// land last-write-wins whenever the pack file re-lands; the content-hash lets each
// member reconcile through the single-carrier Confluence gate at member grain
// (echo · canonical-equivalent · conflict), so a concurrent wiki-edit + disk-change
// names WHICH member conflicts and the rest flow clean.
//
// The hash reads `carrierHash`-family (the member's canonical carrier render,
// algorithm-tagged `sha256:hex`) — the map stores it opaquely, and the gate compares
// it through `digestsEqual`; a value stored bare names no algorithm and matches nothing,
// so that member reads as moved.
