/**
 * crossing-direction — which way a transfer runs, and what that costs.
 *
 * ── THE TWO DIRECTIONS COST DIFFERENTLY, AND ONLY ONE IS RESTRICTED ─────────────────────────────
 * A tiddler copied from a public bag into a more private one raises its confinement: the copy reaches
 * fewer readers than the original did. TW5's recipe stack runs on exactly this — a user takes a public
 * tiddler and keeps a shadowed copy they may alter — and federation gives every user a public shelf to
 * take from. That path stays cheap, because nothing leaves.
 *
 * A tiddler copied the other way RELAXES confinement: material held for few becomes material held for
 * many, and publication admits no return. Information-flow work calls the outward act declassification
 * and restricts it alone; the inward direction it permits freely.
 *
 * ── SO THE RESTRICTION SITS ON THE OUTWARD CROSSING ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Operator ruling: a user may copy and alter a public tiddler into a more private bag. Moving anything
 * from a private bag to a public one belongs to the kahu-cabal signers.
 *
 * This reads the DIRECTION from the two tiers and says what each side must answer. It holds no keys,
 * checks no quorum and reaches no bag — it names the cost, and the gate collects it.
