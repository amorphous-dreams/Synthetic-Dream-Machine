/**
 * who-plane-announce.test.ts — the ANNOUNCE leg, end to end: two vessels announce onto ONE shared per-nexus
 * WHO face, their concurrent writes CONVERGE, and each recognises the other. This is Leg 2's equivalent of
 * bind-under-handle (Leg 1) — it proves the milestone's "announce themselves on the network" at the library
 * level, short of the two-browser human-loop.
 *
 * The sync model under test is the per-nexus shared board (canon: "one public board per confederation"): both
 * vessels write their card into their own replica of the WHO-face doc, the replicas MERGE (the relay's job in
 * production), and both read the merged board into a HandleBook. Recognition is self-certifying + local
 * petname — never a registry. Proven over real Automerge merge, so it stands on the transport a relay carries.
