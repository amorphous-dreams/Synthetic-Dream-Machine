/**
 * The family of PersonaGroup planes, and the one a vessel stands in.
 *
 * The tests worth reading first are the two starred ones. `an unknown group THROWS` guards the failure a
 * fallback would hide: the operator reads one compartment's pet-name and the vessel writes another's
 * plane. The duplicate guard covers the layer-shadowing that makes one group answer a read meant for the
 * other — both silent, both on the identity path.
