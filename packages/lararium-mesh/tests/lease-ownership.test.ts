/**
 * lease-ownership — the cabal's fence and the realm's feed share a fold, never a board.
 *
 * ── TWO PLANES, NOT TWO SENSES OF ONE THING ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A REALM is a cabal's shared CRDT and resources. A CABAL is the collective holding them. A NEXUS is
 * the federated mesh of hardware. Each epoch here belongs to a different one of those.
 *
 * `epoch-lease` addresses the CABAL'S fence: rolling a slot stales every outstanding grant on a
 * resource at once (`lease-rekey` — "the non-renewal half of revocation"). That is an authority act,
 * and it belongs to the vessel that admits.
 *
 * A realm's FEED is the opposite. `cabal-realm` calls it "the realm's own collective-maintenance
 * heartbeat, NOT an authority epoch", and a realm only its owner can feed cannot be read across the
 * members who keep it. It has to take a peer's write.
 *
 * They share a key because a cabal carries no identity of its own — it is named by its realm's doc.
 *
 * ── WHY THE SEPARATION IS LOAD-BEARING ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Both fold by MAX, and neither verifies a seal before folding. One slot carrying a large number is
 * therefore enough to stale a resource. A board that took peer writes AND carried both senses would
 * hand any peer a revocation over resources it has no authority on — denial dressed as maintenance.
 *
 * These pin that the two address spaces cannot see each other, so moving the feed onto a shared
 * board carries no fence with it.
