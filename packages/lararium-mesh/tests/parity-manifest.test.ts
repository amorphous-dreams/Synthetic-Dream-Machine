/**
 * parity-manifest — the ONE machine-checked census of the TS↔py numerics pairs (the pono-homes
 * lift's L4 gate). The isomorphic-parallel-sensorium law: every platform-blind mesh NUMERICS organ
 * either carries a cross-language parity witness, or names its debt out loud (the RUN arc owns the
 * owed py twins — RUN-ARC.md; the migration gate stays ONE FIXTURE PER NUMERIC).
 *
 * What this test enforces, mechanically:
 *   1. CENSUS — every mesh src module matching the numerics name-pattern appears in the manifest
 *      exactly once (a new numerics organ FAILS here until it registers its parity stance).
 *   2. WITNESS — every `witnessed` entry names ≥1 fixture that exists on disk and parses.
 *   3. HONESTY — every owed entry names its py twin (or the debt home), so the eyeball-parity
 *      table below reads as the live map, never a wish.
 *
 * The manifest doubles as the human eyeball-parity table — read the entries, know both bodies.
