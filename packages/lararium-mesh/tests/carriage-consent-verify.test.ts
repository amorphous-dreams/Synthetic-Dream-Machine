/**
 * carriage-consent-verify — a kept consent proves itself, or it counts for nothing.
 *
 * ── WHY A FILE IS NOT EVIDENCE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A joining operator keeps the contract-in she signed so her vessel can read the relation it stands
 * in without a partner's document. That record sits on disk beside the charter, and disk is not a
 * trust boundary: `LAR_ROOT` names the whole seal home, so anything running as its owner may write
 * there. A reading that trusted the file's LOCATION would report a Nexus a vessel never joined.
 *
 * ── THE HOUSE ALREADY HOLDS THE RULE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The admit path verifies the same signature before it counts, on the reasoning that "a Nexus can
 * never manufacture this seal: only the operator holding the nym's seed can produce it". The kept
 * copy earns its reading the same way — trust rides the signature, never the location, exactly as a
 * handle-card is valid only if signed by its own nym.
 *
 * TWO THINGS MUST HOLD, and the second is easy to miss: the signature must verify, AND the nym must
 * be a root THIS VESSEL holds. A consent that verifies under someone else's nym is genuine evidence
 * that SOMEBODY joined — copying it here would let a vessel claim a relation another party entered.
