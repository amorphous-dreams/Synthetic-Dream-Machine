/**
 * signer-class — which of a human's keys may stand on an artifact that travels.
 *
 * ── THE LEAK THIS NAMES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A charter is public by construction: seated keys, threshold and epoch lineage are the material a
 * joining operator verifies a quorum signature against, so it must travel before she can consent.
 *
 * What it carries today is PersonaGroup ROOTS. `seal seat` seats `generateOrLoadPersonaGroupRoot(…)
 * .verifyingKey`, and a founding seat "draws every key from ONE vault … three seated chairs at genesis
 * are therefore three faces of one operator". So the artifact designed to travel publishes three roots
 * of one human's own device-overlay, CORRELATED by standing together in one charter.
 *
 * The same key class signs a membership stamp, while a HandleCard signs with `veiled.verifyingKey` —
 * "the sovereign pseudonym presented through the veil". Only the second is the public Handle.
 *
 * ── THE RULE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A public Handle over a private Persona group is what signs anything shared. Vessel keys and the
 * PersonaGroup those devices compose stay private, so neither belongs on an artifact that travels.
 *
 * This READS a key's class against the material a vessel holds; it decides no policy and moves no
 * key. A key of unknown class is reported unknown rather than assumed safe — an artifact that travels
 * is the wrong place to guess.

  // ── PUBLISHABLE IS NOT THE WHOLE QUESTION ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  // A Handle is MEANT to be seen: a HandleCard announces it, and recognition needs it stable. That
  // same stability correlates a human across every circle they present it in. The persona tree already
  // carries the floor — `m/handle\'/context\'/circle-scope\'`, where the scope index is HMAC(circleDocId),
  // so "the SAME persona presents a DIFFERENT key to each circle it joins" and rejoining is stable.
  //
  // So an artifact scoped to ONE circle wants the SCOPED key. Re-keying a stamp to a bare Handle would
  // remove the device-overlay and keep the cross-circle correlation — a fix that looks like one.
