/**
 * unbuilt-laws — the register of laws these models hold and NOTHING YET ENFORCES.
 *
 * ── WHY A REGISTER, AND WHY IT IS SKIPPED ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This tree's own record names one failure six times: a hand-written enumeration cannot notice what it
 * missed. The cure it reaches for is derivation — the coverage witness reads the code's unions rather
 * than a list. But a law nobody has built declares itself in no union, so derivation cannot find it
 * either. It has to be written down, and the honest place is a test that fails.
 *
 * Every test here is SKIPPED and every one is meant to be UNSKIPPED, never deleted. A green suite that
 * silently omits its own gaps is the shape this house keeps finding; a skipped test with the claim in
 * its title is the shape it keeps choosing (`meta-sidecar-roundtrip`, the deferred front-matter family).
 *
 * ── HOW TO READ ONE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The title carries the LAW and what must land first. Where the surface exists, the body asserts the
 * behaviour we want from it and fails on today's behaviour. Where the surface does NOT exist, the body
 * asserts the export, and those NAMES ARE INDICATIVE — an implementer who picks a better one should
 * change the assertion with it. The law is the title; the name is a placeholder.
 *
 * ── THE THREE PLANES THESE SORT BY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A CABAL is the shared relation over its realm's resources — any community, read as the humans behind
 * its shared Handle cloud. A REALM is that cabal's shared CRDT and other resources. A NEXUS is the
 * federated mesh of hardware many cabals live on. An act belongs to exactly one, and canon #112 rules
 * that fusing two "mis-sites every seat it names".

// composed knowledge domain. That last role is why the exemption costs something rather than merely
// looking untidy — the one place two minds are meant to leave things for each other is the one place
// nothing lands on disk.
//
// WHAT STANDS TODAY, measured: `open-node-vessel` grants the daemon VM `{islandUrl, wikiUrl,
// catalogUrl}` and no `workingUrl`/`personalUrl`/`draftUrl`, so `expandRecipe`'s three instance slots
// prune for want of a handle; `island-recipe` falls the write layer back to the daemon's own bag; and
// `disk-projector` excludes `daemon` from every mirror. Three layers, no working↔canon shore, no disk.
//
// WHAT NO LONGER BLOCKS IT. The instance slots once bound only where a FACE stood, so the daemon
// could not be a client of the resolver it supplies and a faceless floor got no layers at all. That
// gate was what remained of Herm and Lararium having been separate CLASSES; operator ruling made the
// VESSEL KEY the binder, and the mint already confers it — `registerBag` generates the document and
// its generator is admin by construction, so a faceless binding is a doc the VESSEL holds, with a
// face composing on top where one stands. A Herm now resolves its own bindings and can stand a
// `@daemon` wiki for a lamplighter to reach.

// WHAT REMAINS IS WIRING, not authority: the daemon VM's grants are built before the VM that hosts
// the resolver exists, so its own working layer arrives by a LATE ATTACH rather than at open.
