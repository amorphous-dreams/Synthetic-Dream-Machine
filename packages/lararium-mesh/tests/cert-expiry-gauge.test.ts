/**
 * The certificate gauge measures a FRACTION, and that is the whole point.
 *
 * The load-bearing test below is the last one: a threshold written in days-remaining turns into a permanent
 * alarm the moment certificate lifetimes drop beneath it, and lifetimes are dropping on a published
 * schedule. A monitor that always fires stops being read, which is a worse failure than no monitor — so the
 * suite pins the fraction against the day-count on the exact lifetimes the field is heading toward.
