/**
 * cooling-cause — a cache decision must never be reported as a polity's death.
 *
 * ── THE CONFLATION, MEASURED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `deriveCabalRealmLiveness` reads a realm's liveness off its substrate's residency temperature.
 * The file already guards ABSENCE: a substrate this replica never synced reads `unread`, because
 * "temperature is a fact about a PLACE; liveness is a fact about a PRINCIPAL".
 *
 * The guard stops one state short. `anu` arrives from TWO causes that the temperature alone cannot
 * tell apart:
 *   · UNFED  — nobody touched it past `idleMs`. Canon-relevant: `carry-contract` has a cabal
 *              "dissolving to `anu` when unfed", scoped bilaterally ("you are out, BETWEEN US").
 *   · RECLAIMED — this vessel took the memory back: `enforceCap` LRU-trimmed it past `hotCap`, or
 *              the daemon sent an evict request. The sweeper's own note concedes the trim is "pure-age
 *              LRU and so is not scan-resistant — a one-shot sweep over many bags can evict the
 *              genuine working set." Neither mechanism can see how well the realm is fed.
 *
 * So a realm a dozen faces are actively feeding reads `dissolved` because THIS vessel's cache filled.
 * No canon supports "a realm dissolves because its holder held too many realms" — that is a memory
 * budget wearing a governance verdict's clothes.
 *
 * ── THE RULE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `one-name-one-relation`: defaulting an absence is correct WITHIN an axis, a fabricated verdict
 * ACROSS one. Resources → polity is across. A reclaim therefore reports `unread` — this vessel
 * stopped holding it, and that says nothing about who feeds it — and only UNFED cooling carries the
 * reading canon scopes bilaterally. The two causes are named for WHAT THE FACT IS ABOUT, so a new
 * mechanism that frees memory joins `reclaimed` rather than arriving as a third spelling.

  // `dissolved` would report a stale departure and a restored `alive` would vouch for a bag it has not
  // opened. The forgetting is the guard.
