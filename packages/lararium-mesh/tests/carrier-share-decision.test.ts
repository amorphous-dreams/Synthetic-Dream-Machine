/**
 * member-carry-decision.test.ts — the CARRY-SPLIT that lets the mesh BREATHE across a Nexus (operator-ruled
 * 2026-07-20): a cross-operator MEMBER blind-transits a PROVABLY-sealed private plane (carry the ciphertext,
 * never the read-cap); a STRANGER reaches ONLY the federatable public shelf.
 *
 * Proven against the REAL federatable gate + the real deterministic doc urls (no stubs in the decision path):
 *   · the FLOOR is untouched — federatable/public crosses to member AND stranger; a Kapae'd presenter draws Mu,
 *   · a MEMBER + a SEALED private plane → carry TRUE (the blind-transit lane opens),
 *   · a MEMBER + a CLEARTEXT-local plane → DENY (the encrypt-first guard),
 *   · a STRANGER + a SEALED plane → DENY (no sealed carriage for a non-member),
 *   · a Kapae'd MEMBER → Mu even for a sealed plane (the antigen stays ahead of the split),
 *   · READ-LANE UNTOUCHED: with membership=null OR seal=null the fn degenerates EXACTLY to
 *     carryContractShareDecision — the split adds a lane, never widens the floor, never adds a decrypt path.
