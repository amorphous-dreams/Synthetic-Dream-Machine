/**
 * charter-join-policy — the STRANGER dial rides the charter, fail-closed to invite-only.
 *
 * cabal-invite states the law: "The operator turns this. The code never decides it." `joinPolicyFromDoc` puts
 * the turn on the per-Nexus charter the kahu quorum signs, isomorphic with `federationPostureFromDoc`. What
 * matters here is the CLOSED direction: every way the read can go wrong must land on invite-only, because the
 * failure that costs is a torn dial silently dropping signal-2 and letting the DreamNet open by accident.
 *
 * The two dials stay ORTHOGONAL — stranger-admission ⊥ foreign-operator carry. Neither opens the other.
