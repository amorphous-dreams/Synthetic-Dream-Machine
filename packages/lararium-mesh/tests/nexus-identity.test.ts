/**
 * nexus-identity — the scope a SHARED plane resolves under, and why it names no vessel.
 *
 * ── THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Three boards derive their address from one parameter spelled `nexusPubkey`, and every vessel passes
 * its OWN key. Their docs say the address is meant to be per-island — "every island member resolves
 * the one board with no mint-race" — so within one operator's fleet that holds, and across two
 * contracted operators it does not: each resolves a different board and the island splits in two.
 *
 * A Nexus has no key of its own, so any vessel's key is the wrong name for it: whichever operator's
 * key were chosen, the others would be reading someone's vessel rather than their shared island.
 *
 * ── THE GENESIS EPOCH IS THE ISLAND'S NAME ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `genesisSealEpochCid` content-addresses the seated key-set and threshold, so every vessel holding
 * the charter derives the SAME value, it names no vessel, and it survives rotation because the
 * genesis sits at the head of the lineage rather than at its end.
 *
 * ── WHICH PLANES MAY USE IT, AND WHICH MUST NOT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A shared scope is safe exactly where sharing cannot widen a vessel's own authority:
 *   · WHO board       — no write-ACL, cards self-certifying; reading grants nothing.
 *   · antigen (DENY)  — quorum-signed against the charter roster; a foreign ban only TIGHTENS.
 *   · members (SHARED) — a stamp is a public contract into the Cabal, so the RECORD shares. What stays
 *                       this vessel's own is the DECISION to carry for a member, read over that record;
 *                       fusing record and decision is what would conscript it.
 * The asymmetry is the point: a deny may be shared, an allow wants a fresh consent.
