/**
 * The registered bag set is the UNION over the PersonaGroups a vessel stands in.
 *
 * THE AXIS: joined-or-not. A vessel in no PersonaGroup stays an anonymous dyad and carries its own ground.
 * A vessel standing in a group carries that group's work — private and contracted alike, because a fleet that
 * syncs a person's bags to some of their devices and not others has not synced them.
 *
 * AND A VESSEL HOLDS SEVERAL. A human runs more than one PersonaGroup, and the same laptop and phone may
 * carry more than one of them — so the tests drive one group, several, and none. A model that answered
 * only the first would freeze today's boot path into the ontology.
 *
 * WHY A MISSING BAG COSTS SOMETHING. Keyhive's bag→doc map lives in process memory, so a bag absent from
 * this set can never satisfy a cap check — no throw, no warning, an `act LOAD` that refuses forever, on
 * the vessel a person most often carries.
