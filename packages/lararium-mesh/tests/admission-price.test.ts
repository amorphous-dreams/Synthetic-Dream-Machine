/**
 * admission-price.test.ts — does the DIAL actually turn?
 *
 * The whole reason admission must be a PRICE and not a PREDICATE is that "invite-only now, open protocol
 * later" has to be a NUMBER the operator turns, not a rewrite. A boolean gate has a cliff, and no parameter
 * smooths a cliff. This suite measures whether the claim survives contact with arithmetic.
 *
 * It also checks the stabiliser: a vouch lineage where vouching is free is positive feedback, and collapses
 * into an oligarchy of the early. The 1Hive convex wall is supposed to price that cartel out of itself as it
 * forms. If it does not, the founder-oligarchy failure is real and this file says so.
