/**
 * lineage-rank.test.ts — THE EXPERIMENT. Written to KILL the claim, not to confirm it.
 *
 * The outline (lar:///…/admission-on-a-lineage) asserts a sybil bound it did not re-derive and an algorithm
 * nobody reviewed. This file is experiment (2) of the six it owes: build the lineage, mint sybils, and
 * MEASURE the realised benefit against the bound. A green suite here does not prove the outline. It only
 * fails to kill it — and that distinction is the whole discipline.
 *
 * THE BOUND UNDER TEST (Farach-Colton et al., EC 2023, arXiv:1803.05001, Lemma 3): an attacker who subverts
 * a node of honest score x commands at most x/ε rank for ITSELF PLUS EVERY SYBIL IT MINTS, COMBINED —
 * independent of how many it mints. If minting more sybils raises the attacker's total mass, the claim is
 * dead and this file says so.
