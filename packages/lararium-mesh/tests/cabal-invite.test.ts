/**
 * cabal-invite.test.ts — the second signal, and the dial that demands it.
 *
 * The DreamNet opens INVITE-ONLY (operator ruling): a capability alone carries signal-1, cheap and forgeable
 * at scale; the vouch carries signal-2, gatekept by an already-licensed member who stakes their own standing.
 * Later the same dial turns to OPEN, and not one line here changes — which is what a dial buys.
 *
 * Every case runs offline: a fixed clock, a fixed key, no network, no issuer to reach. An invite that
 * needed its issuer REACHABLE would fail in an isolated mesh — and an isolated mesh names the only kind
 * that ever really needs one.
