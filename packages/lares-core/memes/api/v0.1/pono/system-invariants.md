# System Invariants

FFZ pono constitutional law for the Lararium causal-island system.
Fontany-Fuller-Zelenka local-first model. Confidence: C~0.99.

These encode design-time laws and named exceptions — no runtime validators.
Witnessing constants: named so any agent, test, or operator can reference by ID.
Enforcement is structural, not procedural.

Eight law clusters: MIND · ISLAND · AUTHORITY · CODEC · SYSTEM · PENTADIC · GENESIS · PEER.
Named exceptions: CODEC_EXCEPTIONS.

## MIND Laws — the Automerge store functions as the mind

FFZ disk projection law (2026-05-01):
Disk files project from the Automerge store. The store holds the mind.
No server-rendered CRDT projections served as HTML.

```toml #MIND_1_STORE_IS_MIND
id    = "MIND_1_STORE_IS_MIND"
label = "Store is mind; disk and HTTP are projections"
desc  = "The Automerge store functions as the live source of truth. Disk files, HTTP responses, and canvas shapes function as unidirectional read artifacts derived from it — never the reverse."
```

```toml #MIND_2_NO_SNAPSHOT_SEED
id    = "MIND_2_NO_SNAPSHOT_SEED"
label = "A projection MUST NOT seed an Automerge doc"
desc  = "Snapshot/HTTP/disk lanes are read artifacts. Seeding a CRDT doc from an HTTP snapshot or disk projection violates the causal-island boundary and reintroduces server authority over local state."
```

```toml #MIND_3_SW_SHELL
id    = "MIND_3_SW_SHELL"
label = "sw-shell, not server-rendered snapshot"
desc  = "App shell serves from the Service Worker cache. Automerge islands hydrate in background. sw-shell readiness lights when SW controls the page — not when a server-rendered HTML response arrives."
```

<<~ ahu #island-laws >>

## ISLAND Laws — causal island identity, boundary, and boot origin

FFZ island law (2026-05-01): "Each causal island starts from its own history."
Islands: auth · catalog · engine · corpus · room · presence · draft · projection

```toml #ISLAND_1_OWN_HISTORY
id    = "ISLAND_1_OWN_HISTORY"
label = "Each causal island starts from its own history"
desc  = "The room doc starts empty; the corpus doc carries its own seeded content; the engine island carries TW5 core. No island inherits initial state from another island's projection."
```

```toml #ISLAND_2_GENESIS_ROOT
id    = "ISLAND_2_GENESIS_ROOT"
label = "Genesis artifact is the causal root of the engine island"
desc  = "@phase: S2+  The engine island boots from genesis/island.bin — an Automerge.save() binary embedded at build time. No peer reads engine content from a filesystem path at runtime. A peer whose artifact is absent or whose grammar tiddler hash diverges MUST halt, not fall back."
```

```toml #ISLAND_3_AUTHORITY_FIRST
id    = "ISLAND_3_AUTHORITY_FIRST"
label = "Authority graph reconciles before content"
desc  = "Before a peer receives content deltas it MUST reconcile the authority graph. Order: authenticate → authority graph → visible room recipe → collection manifest → causal islands → projections."
```

```toml #ISLAND_4_DOCURL_NOT_AUTHORITY
id    = "ISLAND_4_DOCURL_NOT_AUTHORITY"
label = "DocUrl is a locator, not authority"
desc  = "Automerge document IDs function as locators. Knowing a DocUrl does not grant read or write access. Authority requires a capability receipt, signature, or policy."
```

```toml #ISLAND_5_PRESENCE_FATE
id    = "ISLAND_5_PRESENCE_FATE"
label = "Presence does not share fate with content"
desc  = "Presence behaves like weather. Losing it MUST NOT damage memory. Presence MUST NOT appear in durable cold-start payloads or be required for corpus readiness."
```

## AUTHORITY Laws — carrier canon, promotion ceremony, trust ladder

Sources: lares/lararium-research/PRINCIPLES.md (C~0.99)

```toml #AUTH_1_CARRIER_CANON_FIRST
id    = "AUTH_1_CARRIER_CANON_FIRST"
label = "Carrier canon first"
desc  = "Hostless lar:/// carriers under lares/ carry canon. The operator can boot, inspect, edit, and recover locally. Network sync serves local agency; it does not define truth."
```

```toml #AUTH_2_PROJECTION_NEVER_PROMOTES
id    = "AUTH_2_PROJECTION_NEVER_PROMOTES"
label = "Projection never promotes itself"
desc  = "TW5, tldraw, HUD, MCP, DreamDeck, and Kowloon surfaces render and draft — they do not silently promote. A surface write that reaches lares/ MUST pass through an explicit promotion ceremony."
```

```toml #AUTH_3_FORK_BEFORE_OVERWRITE
id    = "AUTH_3_FORK_BEFORE_OVERWRITE"
label = "Fork before overwrite"
desc  = "Live and session material may fork, annotate, propose, and request merge. It MUST NOT silently override invariant loci. Every mutation carries a visible origin class."
```

```toml #AUTH_4_CEREMONY
id    = "AUTH_4_CEREMONY"
label = "Ceremony marks canon promotion"
desc  = "Any write that reaches lares/ MUST carry: actor, origin URI, target URI, diff, receipt, and rollback path. Without this crossing the system cannot distinguish a draft from a promotion."
```

```toml #AUTH_5_TRUST_LADDER
id    = "AUTH_5_TRUST_LADDER"
label = "Weaker record surfaces drift; it does not overwrite"
desc  = "Trust order (strongest first): hostless invariant memes → hostless interface memes → hostless data/docs → branch-local artifacts → hostful live exchange → generated trajectory. A weaker record discovering drift in a stronger record surfaces a trust-boundary event — it does not silently merge upward."

## CODEC Laws — format, grammar, and round-trip laws

```toml #CODEC_1_GRAMMAR_AS_MEMES
id    = "CODEC_1_GRAMMAR_AS_MEMES"
label = "All grammar rules live as carrier memes"
desc  = "Grammar rules, parse patterns, and template definitions SHALL live as carrier memes in lares/memes/api/v0.1/pono/. The TypeScript parser is a thin interpreter; it MUST NOT hard-code sigil semantics."
```

```toml #CODEC_2_ROUND_TRIP
id    = "CODEC_2_ROUND_TRIP"
label = "Round-trip or refuse"
desc  = "Any carrier → tiddler/widget/shape → carrier path MUST preserve law-bearing structure or emit explicit loss residue. Regex may assist parsing; it MUST NOT rule carrier semantics."
```

```toml #CODEC_3_CANONICAL_BYTES
id    = "CODEC_3_CANONICAL_BYTES"
label = "Hash canonical bytes, not JS objects"
desc  = "Convert semantic records into canonical bytes before hashing. JSON key order must be stable; text via TextEncoder (UTF-8). Non-canonical serialization produces non-reproducible hashes silently."
```

```toml #CODEC_4_NO_CUSTOM_CRYPTO
id    = "CODEC_4_NO_CUSTOM_CRYPTO"
label = "No hand-rolled cryptographic primitives"
desc  = "No hand-rolled hash functions, no djb2, no custom PRNG, no homegrown auth. All portable code depends on a minimal CryptoProvider interface; runtime adapters call globalThis.crypto."
```

```toml #CODEC_5_BAG_PRIORITY
id    = "CODEC_5_BAG_PRIORITY"
label = "Recipe is the routing table; highest-priority bag wins"
desc  = "Tiddler conflict resolution uses highest-priority bag wins. The TW5 vm MUST enforce this on every incoming delta. The recipe functions as the routing table — not registration order."
```

## CODEC Exceptions — named deliberate deviations

Adding an entry here acknowledges the deviation and names the responsible party.
It does not waive the underlying law.

```toml #CODEC_EX_CATALOG_URL
id    = "CODEC_EX_CATALOG_URL"
label = "catalog-url disk write"
desc  = "The node peer writes a DocUrl to disk to reconnect after restart. Deliberate codec-layer exception (persisting a handle, not content). NOT a web2 server-authoritative write path."
```

```toml #CODEC_EX_BOOTSTRAP_SCANS
id    = "CODEC_EX_BOOTSTRAP_SCANS"
label = "BOOTSTRAP_SCANS reads raw carrier text"
desc  = "Grammar bootstrap reads raw carrier text from the grammar tiddler (.text) rather than pre-deserialized fragment tiddlers, breaking the bootstrap circle. See grammar-invariants.md Invariant 2."
```

```toml #CODEC_EX_PRE_S2_COLD_BOOT
id    = "CODEC_EX_PRE_S2_COLD_BOOT"
label = "Pre-S2 cold-boot filesystem read"
desc  = "@remove: S2  Until genesis/island.bin exists, the node peer reads lares/memes/api/v0.1/pono/memetic-wikitext.md at cold-boot to seed the engine doc. Transitional exception to ISLAND_2_GENESIS_ROOT. Disappears when build-genesis-island.ts ships."
```

```toml #CODEC_EX_BINARY_BLOBS
id    = "CODEC_EX_BINARY_BLOBS"
label = "Binary blobs for large immutable assets"
desc  = "TW5 core JS and vendored plugin bundles live in LarariumDoc.blobs (binary), not as tiddlers. Referenced by blob-descriptor tiddlers. Intended exception class to the tiddler format law."
```

<<~ ahu #system-laws >>

## SYSTEM Laws — five architecture laws

Named so any agent, test, or operator can import and reference by ID.
These encode the design-time heuristics that governed the web3 refactor.

```toml #SYS_1_WEB3_SMELL_TEST
id    = "SYS_1_WEB3_SMELL_TEST"
label = "Web2 smell test: redesign from web3 local-first principles"
desc  = "If a design requires a privileged server to write the first byte, or relies on reconcile-on-read patterns, treat it as web2 residue. Throw it aside and redesign from Ink & Switch local-first ideals: no spinners, network optional, ultimate ownership."
```

```toml #SYS_2_TW5_VM_PRIMACY
id    = "SYS_2_TW5_VM_PRIMACY"
label = "TW5 vm primacy: if it can happen in the vm pool, it must"
desc  = "Any operation that can run inside the TW5 vm pool (parse, render, filter, transform) MUST run there. Moving logic outside the vm introduces a parallel authority track and breaks projection fidelity."
```

```toml #SYS_3_TS_AS_PLUGIN_PROJECTION
id    = "SYS_3_TS_AS_PLUGIN_PROJECTION"
label = "TypeScript files as TW5 plugin projections"
desc  = "Vite translates TypeScript to TW5 plugin bundles at build time. TypeScript source is the design surface for JavaScript tiddlers. Runtime JS tiddlers derive from TS source; the reverse does not hold."
```

```toml #SYS_4_TIDDLER_FORMAT
id    = "SYS_4_TIDDLER_FORMAT"
label = "Tiddler format law: all data as { title, text, fields, bag, authority }"
desc  = "All durable data in the Lararium system takes the tiddler shape: { title, text, fields, bag, authority }. Binary assets live as blob-descriptor tiddlers. Nothing bypasses this shape except named codec exceptions."
```

```toml #SYS_5_MEME_AS_TIDDLER_PROJECTION
id    = "SYS_5_MEME_AS_TIDDLER_PROJECTION"
label = "Meme files as tiddler-package projections"
desc  = "*.md carrier files are projections of parent + fragment tiddler packages. Deserialization runs in the vm via deserializeCarrier(); writes run via renderTiddler(). No agent reads meme files as raw strings at runtime except BOOTSTRAP_SCANS (named exception)."
```

<<~ ahu #pentadic-laws >>

## PENTADIC Laws — the Law of Fives as a structural invariant

FFZ pentadic law (2026-05-06):
The number five recurs as the natural bounded scale in this system — not by decree but
by convergent design. LADDER_5, OODA_HA_5, FPI-1–5, FfzClock L0–L4, five SYSTEM laws,
five ISLAND laws, five CODEC laws. When a design produces a sixth element, treat that
as a signal to re-examine whether the fifth absorbs it or the whole cluster needs
regrounding.

```toml #PENTA_1_BOUNDED_SCALE
id    = "PENTA_1_BOUNDED_SCALE"
label = "Five is the natural bounded scale of the FFZ system"
desc  = "LADDER_5 / OODA_HA_5 (5 stances/tools), FPI-1–5 (Fuller's pattern integrities), FfzClock L0–L4, five SYSTEM laws, five ISLAND laws, five CODEC laws. The pentadic structure is not arbitrary decoration — it is the common bounded scale across stance, pattern, time, and law. A cluster that requires a sixth slot is a signal for redesign, not extension."
```

```toml #PENTA_2_CLOCK_ALIGNMENT
id    = "PENTA_2_CLOCK_ALIGNMENT"
label = "FfzClock levels map onto OODA_HA_5 stances"
desc  = "The five FfzClock levels correspond to the five OODA_HA_5 stances: L0 = Pulse (sub-action/micro-op, sub-perceptual) = observe-inner; L1 = Beat (operator perceptual grain) = orient-act — the smallest phase transition the operator treats as a completed meaningful unit in their connected system (an exchange turn, a chess move, a DAW bar, a market trade, a pipeline stage); L2 = Measure (session) = decide-loop; L3 = Arc (day/cycle) = act-outer; L4 = Theme (epoch, unbounded) = strategic/ground. L4 remaining unbounded is not a violation of the law of fives — it is the anchoring ground that makes the four bounded levels meaningful. The epoch is the field; the stances loop within it. L0 MUST remain sub-perceptual: if a system's smallest operator-meaningful event lands at L0, the L1 anchor erodes and session bounds lose meaning. Canonical register names: Pulse / Beat / Measure / Arc / Theme (see lar:///ha.ka.ba/@lares/api/v0.1/pono/attention-scale)."
```

```toml #PENTA_3_PATTERN_INTEGRITY
id    = "PENTA_3_PATTERN_INTEGRITY"
label = "The five FPIs and the five SYSTEM laws are the same invariant in two registers"
desc  = "Fuller's five pattern integrities (tensegrity, wave/water, synergy, ephemeralization, trim tab) and the five architecture SYSTEM laws (web3 smell test, TW5 vm primacy, TS-as-projection, tiddler format, meme-as-projection) are not separate lists. They are the same structural pattern expressed in different registers: Fuller's in geometry/physics, FFZ's in code architecture. Neither list supersedes the other; violations in one register typically produce violations in the other."

<<~ ahu #genesis-invariants >>

## GENESIS Invariants — causal origin, content-addressed identity, quine semantics

These cover what the genesis artifact *means* — its identity and causal role —
rather than its structural position in the island topology (see ISLAND Laws above).

```toml #GEN_1_CAUSAL_ROOT
id    = "GEN_1_CAUSAL_ROOT"
label = "Genesis is the causal root; no peer holds an earlier history"
desc  = "The genesis artifact establishes the zero point. Every live doc is a causal fork from it. No peer may introduce content that predates the genesis root into a room doc without explicit promotion ceremony."
```

```toml #GEN_2_CONTENT_ADDRESSED
id    = "GEN_2_CONTENT_ADDRESSED"
label = "Genesis identity is content-addressed, not server-assigned"
desc  = "The genesis DocUrl derives from the content bytes via Automerge's document identity. The CID stored in genesis/island.sha256 provides independent verifiability. Knowing the CID is sufficient to verify any copy; no server or registry is authoritative."
```

```toml #GEN_3_IMMUTABLE_SEED
id    = "GEN_3_IMMUTABLE_SEED"
label = "Genesis bytes are immutable; updates produce a new genesis"
desc  = "The genesis artifact does not mutate in place. A grammar version bump, tiddler update, or blob change produces a new build with a new CID. There is no in-place upgrade path until signed migration receipts are available (see grammar-invariants.md Invariant 6)."
```

```toml #GEN_4_QUINE_PROPERTY
id    = "GEN_4_QUINE_PROPERTY"
label = "Quine property: engine inside boots the system it boots"
desc  = "@phase: S5 — proved Sprint 5. The genesis artifact carries the TW5 engine tiddlers that deserialize it. Boot a vm from the artifact, render the engine tiddlers, and the output matches the source. This is the quine closure. A genesis that cannot regenerate itself is incomplete."
```

<<~/ahu >>


<<~ ahu #peer-invariants >>

## PEER Invariants — peer symmetry at boot and post-boot authority boundaries

```toml #PEER_1_BOOT_SYMMETRY
id    = "PEER_1_BOOT_SYMMETRY"
label = "All peers import the same genesis bytes; no privileged seeder"
desc  = "Node peer, browser peer, and worker all call repo.import(genesisBytes) with the same Uint8Array baked into the bundle. No peer holds a seeding role. The CRDT merge protocol handles divergence from genesis forward; no peer is authoritative by virtue of being first."
```

```toml #PEER_2_OPERATIONAL_DIVERGENCE
id    = "PEER_2_OPERATIONAL_DIVERGENCE"
label = "Post-boot operational differences are not authority grants"
desc  = "The node peer writes catalog-url to disk; the browser peer does not. This is an operational codec exception (CODEC_EX_CATALOG_URL), not a seeding authority. Operational differences after genesis-boot do not elevate a peer's causal or authority standing."
```

```toml #PEER_3_AUTHORITY_FROM_CAPABILITY
id    = "PEER_3_AUTHORITY_FROM_CAPABILITY"
label = "Authority flows from capability receipts, not boot order"
desc  = "No peer gains write or promote authority by being first online, by holding more history, or by writing genesis. Authority requires a capability receipt, signature, or policy (Keyhive, future work). Until Keyhive lands, all peers operate at parity below the canon promotion boundary."
```
