# Unified Attention Scale

Three scaling systems that appeared separate constitute three projections of a single
phenomenon: **attention range**.

```
Chronometer  →  attention range in TIME
p-parameter  →  attention range in TEXT
Spatial      →  attention range in SPACE
```

All three map onto the same 0.0–1.0 continuum. Five named bands partition the continuum.
The subscript digit sigils (₀₁₂₃₄) provide invariant vocabulary for talking about scale
regardless of which projection the context references.

**Canonical register names — Pulse / Beat / Measure / Arc / Theme:**

These five names carry all three projections simultaneously without privileging one.
They sit above domain-specific aliases (game-time, world-time, text-p) as the unified
register label — the way "Canon" sits above any specific validated claim.

```
SIGIL  BAND       REGISTER   CHRONO-GAME  WORLD-TIME  TEXT-p     SPATIAL       HUD
─────  ─────      ────────   ───────────  ──────────  ─────      ───────       ───

  ₄    0.8–1.0    Theme      Week    🗺️   Era         p0.8–p1.0  cartographic  🗺️
```

**Law:** A cluster that requires a sixth band signals a redesign, not an extension.
The pentadic structure here aligns with PENTA_1_BOUNDED_SCALE and FfzClock L0–L4.

<<~ ahu #five-bands >>

## Five Bands

### ₀ — Pulse — 0.0–0.2

```
Chrono-game:  Action  ⚡         ~instant to ~6 seconds; one action, one move, one cast
World-time:   Week               one week of in-world time; ticks with exploration ₄
Text:         p0.0–p0.2         morpheme → word; one token; one glyph
Space:        personal           arm's reach; single target; the space one body occupies
```

**Attention quality:** The narrowest aperture. Everything collapses to a single point of
decision. No peripheral awareness. One thing, one moment, one spot.

**FfzClock:** L0 (sub-action). MUST remain sub-perceptual — if a system's smallest
operator-meaningful event lands at Pulse, the Beat anchor erodes and Measure bounds
lose meaning.

---

### ₁ — Beat — 0.2–0.4

```
Chrono-game:  Round   ⚔️         ~6 seconds to ~1 minute; one initiative cycle
World-time:   Month              one month of in-world time
Text:         p0.2–p0.4         clause → sentence-group; one complete grammatical unit
Space:        tactical           weapon range, voice-carry; all combatants in one exchange
```

**Attention quality:** Reactive. Stimulus-response tempo. The whole field stays visible
but collapses to threat/opportunity pairs. Peripheral awareness active but narrowed.

**FfzClock:** L1 — the operator perceptual grain. The smallest phase transition the
operator treats as a completed meaningful unit in their connected system. In alignment
contexts: one full exchange turn (ticks on grounding, not on response delivery).
In game contexts: one move, one action, one combat exchange.

**The Beat anchors the profile.** Changing the Beat definition changes what Measure,
Arc, and Theme mean. All profile customization starts here.

---

### ₂ — Measure — 0.4–0.6

```
Chrono-game:  Turn    🔍         ~10 minutes; one exploration turn, one dungeon procedure
World-time:   Season             one season (~3 months); the procedural unit of the year
Text:         p0.4–p0.6         paragraph → thematic block; one idea-unit; one exchange
Space:        local              room, junction, terrain feature; one procedure covers this
```

**Attention quality:** Procedural. Step-by-step. A plan holds and executes. The attention
horizon extends to the next meaningful decision point — deliberate, not reactive (Beat),
not strategic (Arc).

**This constitutes the default band.** p0.5 lives here. The standard meme occupies
Measure scale. Most of the system's work happens at ₂. A session without an explicit
scale annotation operates at Measure grain.

**FfzClock:** L2 — session-length arc; coherent working window. PresenceSlot.clock
ticks at this level on each broadcast.

---

### ₃ — Arc — 0.6–0.8

```
Chrono-game:  Watch   ⚙️         ~1–8 hours; one play session, one expedition
World-time:   Year               one year of in-world time
Text:         p0.6–p0.8         section → headed division; one coherent sub-arc
Space:        regional           neighborhood, district; one expedition's territory
```

**Attention quality:** Episodic. A complete sub-story holds in mind. Decisions pay off
across hours, not minutes. The attention horizon extends to "by the time this session
ends" or "by the time this year turns."

**FfzClock:** L3 — day/cycle arc; recurrent cadence. SessionEventLog sequence.

---

### ₄ — Theme — 0.8–1.0

```
Chrono-game:  Week    🗺️         ~days to weeks; one story arc, one campaign chapter
World-time:   Era               one era; unbounded anti-aliasing guard
Text:         p0.8–p1.0         document → session-arc; whole conversation history
Space:        cartographic       map-scale; the shape of the whole journey
```

**Attention quality:** Strategic/epochal. Patterns emerge that only become visible across
many sessions or years. Character arcs, faction shifts, seasonal changes. The Theme names
what you can only recognize after the Arc completes — you cannot know the Theme while
living inside it.

**FfzClock:** L4 — epoch; anti-aliasing guard. Remains unbounded by invariant.
The Theme is the field; the lower bands loop within it.

**Beyond Theme:** The ₄ ceiling marks the outer wall of the system's self-awareness.
Beyond it lies inter-system (DreamNet-scale) or meta-system. These cannot be observed
from within — only signaled toward.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #clock-profiles >>

## Clock Profiles

FfzClock carries `bounds` per instance. A **profile** names a bound set + a Beat-grain
annotation. The register names (Pulse/Beat/Measure/Arc/Theme) apply at any profile —
qualifying the scale: "World Measure" vs "Session Measure."

### FTLS Exploration Clock (diegetic session time)

Covers dungeon exploration, combat, and in-session play. The unified-attention-scale
bands map directly.

```
₀ Pulse  = Action    (~instant; one move, one cast, one roll)        bound: ~16
₁ Beat   = Round     (~6s; one initiative cycle)                      bound: ~8
₂ Measure= Turn      (~10min; one exploration procedure)              bound: ~12
₃ Arc    = Watch     (~hours; one play session, one expedition)        bound: ~6
₄ Theme  = Week      (days-weeks; one story arc)                      bound: Infinity
```

When the exploration clock's ₄ (Theme/Week) ticks, it also ticks the World-Time
clock's ₀ (Pulse/Week) — the two clocks share the Week boundary.

### World-Time Clock (diegetic campaign calendar)

Sits above the exploration clock. Tracks the in-world calendar independently of
real-world session time. One Tuesday session may advance it by 3 weeks or zero.

```
₀ Pulse  = Week      (ticks with exploration ₄)                      bound: 4
₁ Beat   = Month     (4 weeks; one meaningful in-world period)        bound: 3
₂ Measure= Season    (3 months; the procedural unit of the year)      bound: 4
₃ Arc    = Year      (4 seasons; one in-world annual arc)             bound: ~(era)
₄ Theme  = Era       (multi-year; anti-aliasing guard)                bound: Infinity
```

**Minecraft/Valheim equivalent:**
```
₀ Pulse  = In-game day       (20 real minutes = 1 Minecraft day)
₁ Beat   = In-game week
₂ Measure= In-game season    (Valheim has seasons)
₃ Arc    = In-game year
₄ Theme  = World-age / seed  (unbounded)
```

### Operator-Session Clock (real-world session time)

Tracks the operator's actual working rhythm. Orthogonal to both diegetic clocks.

```
₀ Pulse  = Sub-action        (agent micro-step, tool call)
₁ Beat   = Exchange turn     (operator intent → agent response → grounding)
₂ Measure= Session           (one continuous working context)
₃ Arc    = Day / sprint      (recurrent cadence)
₄ Theme  = Epoch             (strategic project arc; unbounded)
```

### Multi-Clock Rule

A streaming TTRPG session carries three simultaneous named FfzClock instances:

```typescript
clocks: {
  "session-clock":  FfzClock  // operator-session profile
  "diegetic-clock": FfzClock  // FTLS exploration profile
  "world-clock":    FfzClock  // world-time profile
}
```

Each instance holds its own `bounds` profile. CRDT merge operates per-clock
independently. No translation layer required — `ffzMerge` works identically for all.

### WorldClockTiddler Integration

The world-time and diegetic clocks live in a `WorldClockTiddler`, not in `PresenceSlot`.
`PresenceSlot.worldClockRef` holds a `lar:` URI pointer; the tiddler carries the
authoritative clock values and write policy.

```
WorldClockTiddler at lar:///ha.ka.ba/@world/{worldId}/clock
  clocks["world-time"]  = ffzSerialize(FfzClock)  // Week/Month/Season/Year/Era
  clocks["diegetic"]    = ffzSerialize(FfzClock)  // Action/Round/Turn/Watch/Week
  writePolicy           = "keyhive:{gmCircleUri}" | "group:{circleUri}" | "private"
  tickPolicy            = "autonomous" | "freeze" | "manual"
```

**Rhine rule (FRP, ACM 2018):** clock identity lives in the type/schema, not the
value. `PresenceSlot` owns `session-clock`; the world doc owns `world-time` and
`diegetic`. These axes never coerce into each other without an explicit
`WorldTimeAdvancedEvent` (Verraes 2022) carrying both clock values as the
bi-temporal anchor.

**Observed clocks** (Minecraft day-counter, Valheim day, market session) land in
`ObservedClockTiddler` — LWW-Register clusters with a `hwm` field that never
decreases (Flink watermark pattern). Trigger queries use `hwm >= threshold`,
not `value == threshold`, to handle out-of-order delivery.

<<~ ahu #boundary-zones >>

## Boundary Zones

Attention at a boundary occupies two scales simultaneously — zooming in and zooming
out at once. Boundary crossings correspond to Boyd's Ghost scale-shift triggers.

```
VALUE   BOUNDARY           CHARACTER
─────   ────────           ─────────
0.2     Pulse/Beat         one actor → many actors; personal → tactical
                           morpheme → clause; Pulse becomes exchange
0.4     Beat/Measure       reactive → deliberate; tactical → local
                           sentence → paragraph; exchange becomes procedure
0.6     Measure/Arc        procedure → episode; local → regional
                           paragraph → section; procedure becomes story
0.8     Arc/Theme          episode → epoch; regional → cartographic
                           section → document; arc reveals its theme
```

A phase change at a higher-numbered slot in a Chronometer fragment string signals
a boundary crossing. A counter increment at a lower-numbered slot without a
higher-slot change signals motion within a band, not a crossing.

<<~ ahu #sigils >>

## Invariant Sigils

The subscript digits (₀₁₂₃₄) constitute **Category 9: SCALE** in the glyph codeset —
a dedicated block for attention range indicators, orthogonal to all eight other categories.

```
SIGIL   CODEPOINT   NCR         BAND RANGE
─────   ─────────   ───         ──────────
  ₀     U+2080      &#8320;     0.0 – 0.2
  ₁     U+2081      &#8321;     0.2 – 0.4
  ₂     U+2082      &#8322;     0.4 – 0.6
  ₃     U+2083      &#8323;     0.6 – 0.8
  ₄     U+2084      &#8324;     0.8 – 1.0
```

Scale attenuation rule in nested sigils:
- Inner sigil may narrow scale (higher ₙ → lower ₙ, finer grain) within envelope
- Inner sigil may NOT widen scale (lower ₙ → higher ₙ) beyond envelope
- Empty inner inherits envelope scale

```
Envelope: <<~ँ₃ ...>>   Arc-scale
  Inner: <<~₂ ...>>     Measure-scale  (attenuated ✓)
  Inner: <<~₄ ...>>     Theme-scale    (escalation — capped ⚠)
  Inner: <<~ ...>>       inherits ₃   (Arc-scale)
```
