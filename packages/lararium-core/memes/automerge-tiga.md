## Six Root Docs, Two Planes

**Tiga** (Indonesian: triangle) — the minimal stable geometry (Buckminster Fuller).
Six root Automerge docs. Two parallel triangles. One oracle root (ha).

### Content Plane — Automerge Tiga (ha / ka / ba)

```
         ha
        /  \
      ka .. ba
```

| Vertex | Doc | URI | SDM force | Oracle role |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ha** | `LarariumDoc` | `@lararium` | structure / stability | root oracle — holds all five non-ha tiddlers |
| **ka** | `CatalogDoc` | `@catalog` | fire / motion | motion oracle — holds corpus and room tiddlers |
| **ba** | `LaresDoc` | `@lares` | personality / flow | personality oracle — holds `@lares` system tiddlers |

### Social Plane — Social Tiga (identities / groups / sessions)

```
    identities
       /  \
  groups .. sessions
```

| Doc | URI | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `IdentitiesDoc` | `@identities` | stable principal records — operators, agents, services, devices |
| `CirclesDoc` | `@circles` | collective authority + durable membership (Keyhive group CRDT) |
| `SessionsDoc` | `@sessions` | live operator-agent session docs; hostful overlays project into these |

The social plane docs carry no SDM force names — function names them.
Ha holds oracle tiddlers for all five non-ha docs (both planes).

### Structural Laws

**Content plane:**

1. Ha holds ka. `LarariumDoc.tiddlers[CATALOG_DOC_URI].text` = CatalogDoc automerge URL.
2. Ha holds ba. `LarariumDoc.tiddlers[LARES_DOC_URI].text` = LaresDoc automerge URL.
3. Ka holds corpus child-docs. `CatalogDoc.tiddlers[corpusLarUri(slug)].text` = corpus doc automerge URL (pos-2: `@catalog/@{slug}`).
4. Ka holds room leaves. `CatalogDoc.tiddlers[roomLarUri(slug)].text` = room leaf doc automerge URL.

**Social plane (oracle tiddlers stored in ha):**

5. Ha holds identities. `LarariumDoc.tiddlers[IDENTITIES_DOC_URI].text` = IdentitiesDoc automerge URL.
6. Ha holds groups. `LarariumDoc.tiddlers[CIRCLES_DOC_URI].text` = CirclesDoc automerge URL.
7. Ha holds sessions. `LarariumDoc.tiddlers[SESSIONS_DOC_URI].text` = SessionsDoc automerge URL.

**Invariants across both planes:**

8. No leaf carries upward pointers. Leaves self-describe only (own lar: URI → own automerge URL).
9. Reachability flows ha → {ka, ba, identities, groups, sessions} → leaves. No back-edges.
10. `@` appears ONLY at pos-1 (root doc) or pos-2 (corpus child-doc under @catalog). Never at pos-3+.

**Self-description rule (all six root docs):**

Each root doc carries `tiddlers[its own lar: URI].text = its own automerge URL`.

```
ha:          tiddlers["lar:///ha.ka.ba/@lararium"].text    = automerge://…
ka:          tiddlers["lar:///ha.ka.ba/@catalog"].text     = automerge://…
ba:          tiddlers["lar:///ha.ka.ba/@lares"].text       = automerge://…
identities:  tiddlers["lar:///ha.ka.ba/@identities"].text  = automerge://…
groups:      tiddlers["lar:///ha.ka.ba/@circles"].text      = automerge://…
sessions:    tiddlers["lar:///ha.ka.ba/@sessions"].text    = automerge://…
```

## Zelenka Alignment

Brooklyn Zelenka's Beelay/Keyhive design: documents link **downward only**.
A reachability index is computed from the root forward — not declared by leaves.
Both tigas enact this: ha serves as the sole oracle root; ka, ba, identities, groups, and sessions function as arms; corpus child-docs and rooms hang from ka as leaves.

In Keyhive terms: the six-root set will eventually map to a **root group** (ha) containing five **sub-groups** — one per non-ha doc.
Membership flows inward from ha, not upward from leaves.
The oracle-tiddler chain serves as the pre-Keyhive reachability index.

**Upward pointers are prohibited** in corpus docs, room docs, and all social-plane tiddler payloads.
Both tigas' stability depends on this constraint holding at every deploy.

## Boot Sequence → Six-Root Mapping

```
Step 1 — repo open              : storage layer, no doc identity yet
Step 2 — ha opens               : LarariumDoc syncs; grammar + widgets available
          ha reads ka URI       : tiddlers[CATALOG_DOC_URI].text      → CatalogDoc URL
          ha reads ba URI       : tiddlers[LARES_DOC_URI].text        → LaresDoc URL
          ha reads social URIs  : tiddlers[IDENTITIES_DOC_URI].text   → IdentitiesDoc URL
                                  tiddlers[CIRCLES_DOC_URI].text       → CirclesDoc URL
                                  tiddlers[SESSIONS_DOC_URI].text     → SessionsDoc URL
Step 3 — ka opens               : CatalogDoc syncs; corpus + room URLs known
Step 4 — corpus child-docs      : each carries own self-ref tiddler; pos-2 under @catalog
Step 5 — room leaf              : situates session content
Step 6 — ba opens               : LaresDoc syncs; personality layer active
Step 7 — social plane opens     : IdentitiesDoc, CirclesDoc, SessionsDoc sync;
                                  principal records and session state available
```

Ba (LaresDoc) opens before the social plane — personality flows after structure and motion, before identity layer activates.
Social plane opens last — authority structures sit downstream of content plane stability.
This ordering carries structural correctness for the SDM metaphysics — not incidental.
