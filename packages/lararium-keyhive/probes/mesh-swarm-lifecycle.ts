/**
 * MESH-SWARM LIFECYCLE WITNESS — multiple DIFFERENT PersonaGroups (different humans)
 * found + join a SHARED cabal-realm, the membership ceremony crossing a real FILE
 * channel between separate vessels. REAL Keyhive, no mocks.
 *
 * This runs the swarm test the operator ruled: file/POST FIRST (ship it fast), the channel
 * the MembershipChannel SHORE — file/POST rides below it here, live-WS drops in untouched-above.
 * Here the shore runs FileMembershipChannel — envelopes as JSON files in a shared
 * dir (the two-vessel e2e's admit.json move, generalized to N vessels + broadcast). In
 * Docker the same shore becomes a shared volume / HTTP-POST; the ceremony never knows.
 *
 * The drift (the WHO-plane crossing the transport, at last):
 *   1. FOUND    — the founder founds a shared multi-human cabal-realm.
 *   2. INVITE   — founder BROADCASTS an invite over the channel; both joiners receive it.
 *   3. CONTACT  — each joiner offers its contact-card over the channel → the founder.
 *   4. ADMIT    — founder receives each card, joins it (real Keyhive), acks over channel.
 *   5. ROSTER   — the realm's real Keyhive roster holds all THREE different PersonaGroups.
 *   6. CLOCK    — the capture-clock reads a MULTI-human realm: here the spread reads
 *                 MEANINGFUL (different principals) — the contrast to the me's immunity.
 *
