/**
 * CROSS-PEER-DECRYPT PROBE — the decisive test the crossing rests on.
 *
 * The question the crossing rests on: can a DISTINCT-IDENTITY joinee (the True Name Model — its OWN per-vessel
 * key, NOT a copy of the founder's) decrypt a group's content having received ONLY PUBLIC bytes — the
 * delegation, the CGKA ops, the Encrypted blob — with NO secret in transit (no prekey-secret install, no
 * archive, no `*Keyed` application secret)?
 *
 * VERDICT (keyhive alpha.6, running code): YES — the joinee decrypts from public bytes + its OWN prekey
 * secret alone. keyhive's CGKA keys content to the tree epoch, and add-member climbs a path that encrypts to
 * the new leaf, so nothing secret crosses the relay. The crossing is a TRANSPORT problem, not a crypto one.
 *
 * ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING — keyhive read is FORWARD-ONLY. A member reads content encrypted AT OR AFTER its
 * add, never pre-join content (keyhive's own test_cannot_decrypt_content_from_before_joining asserts the
 * "Key not found" that encrypt-before-add produces — "the forward-secrecy boundary of CGKA"). So the founder
 * ADDS first, then ENCRYPTS, and captures the events AFTER the encrypt (they carry the PCS update op keying
 * to the joinee's leaf). Granting a new member PRE-EXISTING content needs a founder RE-ENCRYPT per chunk
 * (route A — still public ops + ciphertext) OR the `*Keyed` shortcut (route B — ships a 32-byte app secret,
 * which DOES need a sealed channel; not used here).
 *
 * SELF-ASSERTING: exits 0 only when the joinee decrypts from public bytes alone; exits 1 on any failure. So
 * `tsx …/cross-peer-decrypt.ts` runs as the crossing's acceptance gate — a keyhive bump or a code change
 * that breaks the forward-read property trips a non-zero exit.
 *
 * Usage: pnpm exec tsx packages/lararium-keyhive/probes/cross-peer-decrypt.ts
 * Findings land in packages/lararium-keyhive/probes/FINDINGS.md.
