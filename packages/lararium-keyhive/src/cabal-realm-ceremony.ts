/**
 * cabal-realm-ceremony — the reusable cabal-realm LIFECYCLE TRIO (found / join /
 * evict) over real Keyhive, composed onto the platform-blind mesh FLOOR
 * (@lararium/mesh: cabal-realm.ts + epoch-lease.ts + bag-residency.ts).
 *
 * This GENERALIZES the one-off MeshCabal founding block in
 * ceremony-core.ts (~line 161 — createSentinelDoc(MESH_CABAL_SENTINEL_URI) +
 * addSentinelMember) into a primitive any number of cabal-realms re-enact: a
 * realm FOUNDS by minting its sentinel Document identity and takes a dweller by
 * adding them to that sentinel. The mesh floor carries
 * the LIVENESS (lease + residency); this carries the AUTHORITY graph (Keyhive).
 *
 * DESIGN CONSTRAINTS:
 *   · DOCUMENT, not Group, and that is RULED rather than pending. A Group carries one HUMAN'S
 *     cloud — a veil, a PersonaGroup — where nested membership is the real shape. A CABAL takes
 *     a Document: canon #the-realm names the realm by its content-addressed *doc* identity, and
 *     a cabal IS the shared relation over that realm's resources, so it has no other name to
 *     take. `transitiveMembers()` would answer a question nobody asks of a cabal here.
 *     GroupId round-trips from stored bytes, so persistence never decided this either way.
 *   · forward_secrecy STAYS false — a deliberate THREAT-MODEL CHOICE, not an
 *     architectural impossibility (BeeKEM the substrate DOES keep
 *     FS against a passive adversary; the FS falls away one layer up, at Keyhive's
 *     whole-DOCUMENT-access — a current member reads the whole doc, so per-chunk FS
 *     buys little, and replayable access lets a later-admitted device derive the key.
 *     See keyhive-provider.ts init `false`). This module never touches it (it rides
 *     the provider's init choice).
 *   · membership rides the Keyhive DOC-ROSTER — a LIST verified per-member against the
 *     sentinel (dwellersHolding below), NOT the closure-query of canon
 *     #RULED-by-the-closure. The closure ("evaluated as a query, never instantiated")
 *     stands unbuilt. `dwellersHolding` FILTERS and so needs candidates already in hand;
 *     where none are, `KeyhiveProvider.sentinelCgkaMembers` enumerates the effective
 *     reader set instead. Both read THIS replica — an unsynced offering is absent from
 *     each, so neither length is a count across the mesh.
 *
 * THIN CEREMONY: this calls the provider + the mesh floor and bakes NO legitimacy.
 * The join routes through cabalRealmJoinGate (INERT — the Ostrom-P1 voucher/capture
 * answer mounts there when the operator seats it; #the-unswept-corner stays OPEN). The
 * introduction of a member as a known Keyhive agent (receiveContactCard) stays the
 * CALLER's job — mirrors the founding ceremony, whose vessel/PersonaGroup agents
 * already stand in-scope before addSentinelMember.

/**
 * OPEN a dwelling — grant one party access to the realm's sentinel, which carries the SUBSTRATE half of dwelling.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT DO. It opens the door; it deposits no standing. Dwelling accrues by the acts a
 * party takes once inside (`nohopapa` — the settling that maintaining deposits), and this ceremony holds none
 * of that: no depth, no rank, no roster entry. A party who opens a dwelling and never acts has exactly the
 * standing they arrived with, which reads as the model behaving correctly rather than as a gap in this function.
 *
 * THE GATE STAYS INERT, deliberately. `cabalRealmJoinGate` bakes no legitimacy — a gate that computed it would
 * BECOME the captured object (`cabal-realm#the-unswept-corner`). Whatever conversion rite a realm runs before
 * opening a dwelling stays that realm's own and never reaches this layer (`the-thing-event#unmodelled`).
 *
 * NO CLOSING PAIR EXISTS, and that reads as the design. This module holds no party-level eviction: a realm
 * holds no container a party could be put out of, so no eviction reaches one. Dwelling ends when the
 * dwelling stops, and a
 * hostile hand shadows the RELATION (`edge-kapae`) rather than the party. Where captors must be left behind
 * wholesale, a fork excludes BY OMISSION — the survivors open dwellings in a fresh realm and no hand ever
 * opens the captors one (`fork-realm-ceremony`).
 *
 * The caller introduces the party as a known Keyhive agent (receiveContactCard) first — this ceremony assumes
 * an in-scope agent, mirroring the founding.
