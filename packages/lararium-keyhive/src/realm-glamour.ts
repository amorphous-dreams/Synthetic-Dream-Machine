/**
 * realm-glamour — the PUBLIC face of a cabal-realm: its CHARTER, the only
 * thing that ever crosses the read-face wire. A pure disclosure SHORE (mirrors
 * mesh-palace's `snapshotPublicFlowMap`): drop-private, keep-public.
 *
 * Canon: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/cabal-realm#/the-realm (NAMED-not-ruled —
 * "the realm's identity is content-addressed; the name grants no authority" — though
 * it does leak metadata; see THE VEIL INVARIANT below)
 * + lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/mesh/dreamnet-architecture ("cabalGroup = shared
 * charter, read-scope"). The read/veil tier ALREADY EXISTS as the oracle
 * read-face (content-addressed snapshot + signed pointer, fetch-CORS, anon-read);
 * THIS cut adds NO gate-loosening. It makes a CONTENT decision: it declares WHAT a
 * ⚠ `charter` HERE NAMES THE PUBLISHED FACE — editorial, delegable, its own rate — and NOT the
 * seal lineage or the roster that `nexus-seal-seed.ts` files under the same word. Six joints ride
 * one name across this package (canon `cabal-realm#six-joints`); the naming ruling stands open.
 *
 * cabal-realm publishes PUBLICLY (its charter — veil-public) vs holds MEMBERS-ONLY
 * (its substrate + roster — private, behind the Keyhive CGKA membership),
 * and wires the charter to the existing read-face's served projection.
 *
 * THE BOUNDARY (the veil-public SET, #the-veil-public-set below):
 *   · VEIL-PUBLIC  — the CHARTER: a small, content-addressed name + bearing + a
 *                    few deliberately-published descriptive fields. Anon-readable.
 *   · MEMBERS-ONLY — the substrate CONTENT + the member ROSTER + the liveness
 *                    lease slots + the epoch keys. NEVER crosses the shore.
 *
 * THE VEIL INVARIANT (in-process CORRECTNESS, NOT a privacy guarantee):
 * `projectRealmGlamour` reads ONLY the public fields of its input and
 * constructs a literal naming ONLY charter fields. The members-only data (roster /
 * substrate content) rides the SAME input bag yet stays structurally unreachable in the
 * output — the shore never references it, so a roster or substrate content CANNOT
 * leak through THIS function. That kills the accidental roster-in-output bug. It guarantees
 * NOTHING against an adversary, who lives on the WIRE (the signed pointer
 * leaks version / activity / membership-change timing — Pfitzmann-Hansen) and at the
 * members-only STORE (its own sync + access patterns), never inside the projector.
 *
 * Platform-blind: rides @lararium/mesh's cabal-realm + oracle-substrate + pinned-doc only. NO
 * node: imports.
 *
 * Meme: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/cabal-realm
