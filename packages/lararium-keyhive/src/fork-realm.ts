/**
 * fork-realm — FORK-AS-EXIT, the capture-answer's ESCAPE half (pairs the capture-CLOCK's
 * sight). When persistence ≠ legitimacy bites — a hostile minority out-maintains an
 * apathetic majority and holds a captured realm — the legitimate maintainers carry the
 * realm's life into a FRESH realm that STRUCTURALLY EXCLUDES the captors (a new
 * content-addressed identity + epoch they cannot follow), and each vessel RE-POINTS its
 * own petname to the fork. The captured shell cools alone.
 *
 * Canon: cabal-realm#the-unswept-corner (fork-as-exit PRIMARY; the Steem→Hive
 * airdrop-exclusion made native). Two moves, both cheap (Hirschman: exit disciplines a
 * captor only while forking stays cheap):
 *   · EXCLUDE BY OMISSION — the fork stands a NEW realm; no hand ever adds the captors
 *     to it (cleaner than convergent-removal, which evicts from a realm you KEEP; a fork
 *     names a realm you LEAVE). They hold the dead shell, not the living fork.
 *   · RE-POINT (Zooko) — each vessel updates its OWN local realm-pointer old→new. The id
 *     changing carries the FEATURE: no global consensus, no admitter re-anchors the name.
 * Legitimacy re-anchors via CONTINUITY (Vitalik #1): the fork records forkedFrom, so the
 * fork that preserves the pre-capture membership inherits the default legitimacy.
 *
 * This floor holds pure MODEL (survivor computation · re-point · continuity link); the actual
 * founding of the fresh realm rides the Keyhive ceremony (fork-realm-ceremony.ts).
 *
 * Platform-blind: rides @lararium/mesh's CabalRealm only. NO node: imports.
 * Meme: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/cabal-realm
