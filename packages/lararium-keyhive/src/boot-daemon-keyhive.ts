/**
 * boot-daemon-keyhive — the isomorphic keyhive boot+gate sequence for the daemon
 * island. ONE function, called identically on every platform's daemon worker.
 *
 * Stage 1 of the isomorphic-vessel epic moves authn/z off the host and into the
 * daemon island. This function is the heart of that move, extracted PURE (no
 * worker, no platform API) so it unit-tests in-process. The daemon island's
 * `onEa` calls it with the seed (delivered via the manifest) and the daemon
 * CompositeStore (the cap-event EventStore backing); the host no longer boots
 * keyhive at all (keyhive cannot double-boot — `generateDocument` mints a fresh
 * CSPRNG doc-id each call, so two instances diverge).
 *
 * Founding never happens here: a new operator's first boot founds on the host
 * (`runFoundingCeremony` via the platform `loadBootstrap`) BEFORE the daemon
 * worker spawns. This function always receives an already-founded operator and
 * GATES — identical whether the operator is new (just founded this boot) or
 * returning.
