/**
 * face-join — the keyhive half of joining an operator's own face, run INSIDE the daemon island.
 *
 * THE SPLIT THIS FILE SERVES. A device-admit confers STANDING: the founder's persona root signs an edge naming
 * the joinee's vessel key, the joinee pins the KEL prefix, and its Binding Gate walks to the head. That edge
 * answers *what this vessel counts as*. It confers no CAPABILITY — a joinee holding only an edge reaches the
 * PersonaGroup's plaintext planes (the self-slot fleet-syncs them same-operator) and decrypts nothing sealed,
 * because keyhive knows no such member. This file closes that second half, and keeps the two apart: a human
 * confers standing once, by hand; the machine completes the capability over the wire.
 *
 * WHY THE daemon ISLAND OWNS IT. The island already holds the booted provider (`operator-daemon-behavior`
 * delegates every freshly minted bag through it), and the event store admits ONE writer. A second process
 * opening its own provider over the same store would stand a second holder against a single-owner store. So
 * the join rides the verb surface every other act rides — and rides it toward the HEARTH. The daemon bag stays
 * sovereign-per-vessel (a joinee seeds its own at admission), so a summons written to a joinee's own plane
 * reaches nobody. The joinee writes onto the HEARTH's daemon doc, by the url the admit payload names, and the
 * outcome lands beside it on that same plane for the joinee to read back.
 *
 * WHAT CROSSES, AND WHY IT MAY. The grant carries `eventsForPeer` output — PUBLIC membership + CGKA ops,
 * encrypted to the joinee's own prekey. No prekey secret, no archive and no application key rides here (the
 * `eventsForPeer` contract), so the grant may sit in a synced doc without leaking a read-cap. The founding path
 * already stores cap-events in the daemon doc for boot hydration; this puts them where that precedent put them.
 *
 * THE GATE IS A SIGNATURE, NEVER A LIST. A vessel keeps no register of the devices it admitted — a roster IS a
 * global now, and this house holds contracts instead. The joinee therefore PRESENTS its edge, and the gate
 * VERIFIES it: signed by this vessel's own persona root, bound to this hearth, unexpired, and naming the very
 * key the presented ContactCard carries. Nothing is looked up, so nothing can drift or be forged by writing to
 * a list. Three of the four checks read the edge alone and run BEFORE the card enters local state.
 *
 * FRESHNESS READS TWO INSTRUMENTS, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM DECIDES. The LEASE — a per-resource max-register epoch,
 * monotone and read locally — carries the authority: a grant bound below the current epoch reads stale. The
 * wall clock only backstops replay, because every device narrates its own "now" unreliably and no island holds
 * the other's. A gate that read the clock alone would rest a capability decision on that narration.
