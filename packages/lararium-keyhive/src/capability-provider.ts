/**
 * CapabilityProvider — narrow interface over Keyhive's pre-alpha API.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GATE ANSWERS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT.
 *
 * This interface carries Keyhive's binary access gate — `read` or `admin`, cryptographic, one Keyhive
 * Document per Lararium bag URL. That is the whole of what any code here checks.
 *
 * The ACCESS axis — `pull · read · edit · admin`, a 1:1 lexical mirror of Keyhive's native verbs — is
 * a MODEL and not a second gate. `CapabilityAccess` admits two values at every call site in this tree,
 * so nothing narrows an action by verb today. Naming the axis here as a checked tier would promise a
 * reader a gate they could then fail to find. The model stands at
 * lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/causal-islands, where a reader meets it as doctrine.
 *
 * Not rungs even in the model: `promote`/`propose` (ceremony), `sync` (pull-at-scale),
 * `revoke` (an admin op).
 *
 * The interface is provider-shaped so implementations can swap:
 *   * KeyhiveProvider — wraps @keyhive/keyhive WASM
 *   * NoopProvider (test) — always-allows, no crypto
 *   * Future: a Beelay-shaped provider when upstream stabilizes
