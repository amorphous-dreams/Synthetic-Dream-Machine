/**
 * CapabilityProvider — narrow interface over Keyhive's pre-alpha API.
 *
 * Two-tier policy (decided after D.1.5):
 *   * Tier 1 (this interface) — Keyhive's binary access gate. read or admin.
 *     Cryptographic. Per-bag (one Keyhive Document per Lararium bag URL).
 *   * Tier 2 (application layer) — finer-grained ABILITY_LADDER caveats
 *     (promote, write, propose, …) checked AFTER Keyhive's admin proof
 *     verifies. Lives in promote-handler and friends, not here.
 *
 * The interface is provider-shaped so implementations can swap:
 *   * KeyhiveProvider (D.2) — wraps @keyhive/keyhive WASM
 *   * NoopProvider (test) — always-allows, no crypto
 *   * Future: a Beelay-shaped provider when upstream stabilizes
