/**
 * EventStore — persistence shape for Keyhive events.
 *
 * Every Keyhive op (PREKEY_ROTATED, CGKA_OPERATION, DELEGATED, REVOKED, etc.)
 * gets handed to our `event_handler` callback at the moment it fires. The
 * handler routes those events to the EventStore for durable persistence.
 *
 * Phase D.2 ships an InMemoryEventStore — sufficient for the smoke test
 * and unit work. D.4 introduces a tiddler-backed AdminEventStore that
 * persists events under lar:///ha.ka.ba/@lararium/@admin/cap/<hash> in
 * the admin doc.
 *
 * On daemon boot, the EventStore lists all stored events and replays them
 * via Keyhive.ingestEventsBytes() to restore in-memory state. Events are
 * causality-tracked internally by Keyhive; we don't need to sort.
