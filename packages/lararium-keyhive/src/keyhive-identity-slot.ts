/**
 * KeyhiveIdentitySlot — the pono IdentitySlot: every method rides the REAL
 * Keyhive capability barrier, never a permissive default.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES HERE (not in @lararium/mesh): mesh owns the `IdentitySlot`
 * interface but CANNOT import Keyhive — keyhive imports FROM mesh, so a mesh→
 * keyhive edge would close a package cycle. This mirrors the #49 federation-gate
 * precedent exactly: mesh keeps the narrow deny-nothing default (OpenIdentitySlot)
 * as its alpha socket; the crypto-backed implementation slots in behind the
 * SAME interface from the keyhive package, no call-site churn.
 *
 * Each method routes through a real `CapabilityProvider` (KeyhiveProvider in
 * production): `verify` rides genuine `accessForDoc` (Ed25519 membership),
 * `delegate` mints a real revocable delegation event.
 *
 * ── HONEST BOUND ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * PROVABLY ENFORCES (rides real crypto, at any call site that invokes it):
 *   · A presenter never delegated (or since revoked) CANNOT obtain
 *     verifyCapability → true. The verdict is `provider.verify().ok`, which
 *     resolves bagUrl→docId, materializes the island, and calls Keyhive's
 *     `accessForDoc` — a genuine capability check, not an id-guess gate.
 *   · edit ⇒ admin: a read-only delegation does NOT satisfy verifyCapability(…,
 *     "edit"). "edit" maps to the "admin" rung; admin satisfies read, read never
 *     satisfies admin (KeyhiveProvider.verify §402-419).
 *
 * OUT OF SCOPE (the held wiring second-half + BeeKEM):
 *   · NOTHING in production calls these methods yet. This class is the built,
 *     tested crypto-backed slot; wiring a sharePolicy / LarVessel call site to
 *     construct it (retiring the OpenIdentitySlot default) is a SEPARATE thread.
 *     Until then it enforces at runtime only where a call site chooses to invoke
 *     it — construction alone gates nothing.
 *   · TRUE read-confidentiality — denying a *guessed* doc id and hiding the
 *     bytes at rest — is BeeKEM (Keyhive's encryption layer), not this shore.
 *     This slot gates the sharePolicy ACCESS decision; it does not encrypt.
 *   · verifyDelegation trusts the audience the token NAMES (see its doc): it
 *     confirms that named audience genuinely holds the cap via accessForDoc, but
 *     does not cryptographically bind the *presenter* to the token. Presenter↔
 *     token binding is the WASM sync-time membership proof, not this shore.
