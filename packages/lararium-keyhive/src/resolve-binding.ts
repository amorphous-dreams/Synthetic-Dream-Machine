/**
 * resolve-binding — resolver/minter for the `personal` and `draft` recipe
 * slots, keyed by (PersonaGroup × recipe-fingerprint).
 *
 * Isomorphic + island-side (isomorphic-vessel epic). Lives in @lararium/keyhive
 * — the cap layer both platforms depend on — because the mint sequence needs
 * keyhive (`registerBag` + `delegate`), which lives only in the daemon island
 * after Stage 1. Both platform daemon-island entries call it from their
 * `resolveBinding` callback with the island Repo + daemon composite + booted
 * keyhive. (It also still runs host-inline in `open-node-vessel` until the flip
 * removes the host keyhive.)
 *
 * Mint sequence (Q7 — orphan-tolerant idempotent mint): `repo.create()` →
 * `registerBag()` → `delegate()` → write binding tiddler. Not atomic; a crash
 * mid-sequence orphans a docUrl. Next boot recomputes the same fingerprint,
 * finds no binding, re-mints; the orphan stays unreferenced.
 *
 * Daemon reads/writes go through the daemon-bag CompositeStore (`get` /
 * `put({bag: DAEMON_BAG_ID})`) — host: `daemonVm.composite`; island: `ctx.composite`.

 * Canon: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/api/personal-slot
