/**
 * ceremony-core — isomorphic DreamNet founding and vessel-admission ceremonies.
 *
 * This module contains zero vessel-specific code. It runs identically in:
 *   - Node vessel (lararium-node wraps it with NodeFS + disk keypair)
 *   - Browser vessel (lararium-browser wraps it with IndexedDB + WebCrypto keypair)
 *   - Mobile vessel (any future vessel with its own storage adapter)
 *
 * The four vessel-specific shores the caller provides:
 *   repo         — Automerge Repo backed by any StorageAdapter
 *   vesselSeed — the PLACE's own 32-byte Ed25519 seed, from any secure store
 *   (founding ceremony also needs verifyingKey + displayName for identity tiddler)
 *
 * The result types carry all minted data; the caller decides where to persist
 * the bootstrap artifact (disk, IndexedDB, stdout, etc.).
 *
 * Identity lattice produced by runFoundingCeremony:
 *   Vessel Individual (from seed)
 *     └─▶ PersonaGroup sentinel Document (Gate B at boot)
 *              └─▶ MeshCabal sentinel Document (Gate C at boot)
 *
 * At t=0, founding operator's PersonaGroup is the only MeshCabal member.
 * the carriage contract adds co-operators. The MeshCabal grows; this path never re-runs.
 *
 * The TRUE NAME MODEL the ceremony enacts — two DISTINCT keys, one signed edge:
 *   · `vesselSeed` carries the PLACE's own key — minted per-install,
 *     never copied to another vessel. It mints the Vessel Individual and inits Keyhive.
 *   · `binding` carries the PERSONA ROOT's authority — the HUMAN's side. A SELF-STOOD binding holds
 *     that root's seed, which ONLY signs and never inits Keyhive; a CONTRACTED binding holds no seed
 *     at all, carrying instead an edge some other operator already signed.
 *   · `buildDeviceDelegation` binds them without merging them: the persona root signs
 *     "Operator O delegates to Device D AT PLACE P", where `hearthTrueName` names P — the
 *     hearth's True Name. Peers pin the root and verify that edge offline.
 * `runDeviceAdmitEdge` carries the same shape outward: the founder's root signs a joinee's
 * OWN vessel key into the PersonaGroup, so no seed ever crosses the wire. A single key
 * copied across vessels would present one collector to every verifier and link every self —
 * the split is what the veil rests on. See lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/docs/federation.

 * How a founding binds its device to its hearth — the two modes, made explicit rather than inferred.
 *
 * SELF-STOOD carries a seed that SIGNS: the vessel builds its own device-delegation and seats a fresh
 * persona-KEL inception. It never inits Keyhive with that seed (the per-vessel key stays the Individual).
 *
 * CONTRACTED carries no seed at all. A trusted operator, already contracted with the kahu, signed the edge
 * on THEIR vessel; this one carries the edge, the pinned identifier prefix, and the operator's KEL chain.
 * The chain rides ALONG because the Binding Gate walks it from the LOCAL replica — a vessel that founded
 * without it would boot fail-closed with no head to reach, waiting on a federation it cannot yet perform.
 * Carried, never fetched: a crossroads that holds no human key also holds no way to go ask for one.

// ── THE TWO HALVES OF A FOUNDING ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A founding stands TWO things, and canon keeps them apart: a PLACE (a somewhere — addressable,
// carriable, vouchable) and a FACE (a someone — a persona root, its key-event-log, the edge binding
// a device to it). `identity-classes#herm-establishment` rules the separation outright: the Herm
// "boots permissionlessly on its own key… it asks no blessing to exist", and "NO civic identity mints
// into the Herm" — only the wax-sealed contract edges.
//
// So the place founds ALONE and the face lands on top of it, by a later operator act. Fusing them made
// every vessel mint a human's root before it could carry a single byte, which is the one thing a
// crossroads exists not to do.
//
// WHERE THE CABAL SITS, AND WHY NOT THE PLACE: a MeshCabal holds MEMBERS, and its members read as
// PersonaGroups — faces. `IdentityAnchors` already files it that way, keyed by handle-index beside the
// persona ids, and the boot path calls cabal membership AFFILIATION rather than identity (a PersonaGroup
// belongs to many cabals or none). So a cabal seeded on a place identifier would hold a membership
// structure with nothing that can be a member.
//
// A faceless place carries by CONTRACT instead — the wax-sealed carriage edge canon gives the Herm:
// "No civic identity mints into the Herm — only the wax-sealed contract/edges." Carry ⊥ read holds
// without a cabal, because the edge carries the authority a seat would have.
