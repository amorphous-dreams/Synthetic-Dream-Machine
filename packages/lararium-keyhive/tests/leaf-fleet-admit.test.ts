/**
 * leaf-fleet-admit — an END-USER's fleet, which holds no node at all.
 *
 * Every join proven so far ran with a node vessel as the hearth. An end-user's fleet is browsers and phones:
 * leaves only. One of them holds the face and seats the others, and the word "isomorphic" is either true here
 * or it was decoration.
 *
 * TWO PROPERTIES SEPARATE THIS FLEET FROM AN OPERATOR'S.
 *
 * First, a self-stood leaf is HEARTH-AGNOSTIC — it founds with `hearthTrueName: ""`, because a vessel that
 * binds to no engine CID has no place to name. So the gate's hearth check compares "" against "" for every
 * leaf on earth and separates NOTHING. In an operator's fleet the hearth true-name is a second wall; here the
 * ROOT SIGNATURE carries the whole weight, and the cross-fleet vector below is the one that proves it.
 *
 * Second, a leaf fleet has no always-on hearth and no filesystem. The vessel holding the face must be AWAKE to
 * seat anyone, and no archive persists — so the recovery keel an operator's node provides is simply absent,
 * and a leaf that loses its store returns as a new device rather than a restorable one. Its device key lives
 * in the same store, so nothing survives to restore INTO; the loss is total by construction, never partial.
