/**
 * cabal-realm ceremonies — the founding layer under test against REAL Keyhive.
 *
 * The probes drift a whole lifecycle and print; these pin the PROPERTIES a later hand could break silently.
 * Each one asserts a refusal as hard as an ability: no roster to read, no closing pair to call, no legitimacy
 * baked in the gate, no standing deposited by opening a door. The founding path runs unguarded otherwise — a
 * reversed argument or a re-added eviction reaches the operator's own hearth before anything catches it.
 *
 * Real Keyhive, no mocks: the sentinel stands as a real Document, each dweller as an independent provider
 * introduced by contact card, the liveness reading as a real residency tier.
 *
 * Canon: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/cabal-realm
