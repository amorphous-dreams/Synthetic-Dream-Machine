/**
 * bed-manifest-sources — every declared pour must point at ground that stands.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Three manifests spent weeks sourcing `bags/lares/…/library/…` after the library moved
 * home to the `crossroads` bag (2026-07-19 — the same day one of those manifests was authored). Nothing was lying
 * and nothing was checked, so a re-pour would have read ZERO sources and produced an empty bed that looks
 * exactly like a completed one. A pour that finds nothing and a pour that finds nothing to say generate
 * identically, which is the whole reason this guard reads paths rather than results.
 *
 * A HELD manifest declares itself held. `pidgin-sessions` sources a `_HELD_…` marker on purpose — an open
 * fork the operator has not seated — so the guard skips a source that NAMES itself held and fails any other
 * absence. A held fork is a decision; a stale path is a fault.
 *
 * A `library:<collection>` source resolves against the vessel's OWN shelf, which no repository carries and no
 * checkout guarantees. The guard therefore checks its SHAPE rather than its presence: a reference that names
 * a valid collection passes here, and whether the bytes stand is the pour's own refusal to make (bed_manifest
 * REFUSES on zero records). Checking presence would fail every clone that has not fetched, turning a
 * portable reference back into a machine-local path — the exact property it exists to remove.
