/**
 * mine-timeout — a SELF-TUNING subprocess-timeout servo for every `mempalace mine` / loci_io
 * call, modeled on the nalu-gate feedback servo (mesh gate-tuning#adaptGate + capture-engine's
 * EWMA cost loop) but INVERTED. A flush gate is a fire-THRESHOLD the servo SHRINKS under load
 * (smaller batches, flush sooner); a timeout is an upper-bound-to-KILL the servo GROWS under load
 * (more headroom when mines run slow) and SHRINKS when they run fast (catch a hang sooner). The
 * old fixed 30 s / no-timeout constants let a wedged mine block for 9 h; this bounds every mine to
 * ≤ CEIL, while never false-killing a slow-but-honest one (it learns the real duration first).
 *
 *   OBSERVE  each mine's wall-duration on completion → recordMineDuration.
 *   STATE    a per-pathKey EWMA (α=0.2, mirroring capture-engine's COST_EWMA_ALPHA) + sample
 *            count. Module-level, in-memory — it re-learns after a restart; FLOOR/CEIL bound it
 *            meanwhile, so a cold servo is still safe.
 *   COMPUTE  timeout = clamp(K · ewma, FLOOR, CEIL); until minSamples, a sane default holds.
 *   KILL     the call site passes the timeout to execFile(Sync) `timeout` + `killSignal` — a hang
 *            is KILLED (SIGKILL, guaranteed death even for a wedged native extension), distinct
 *            from a BUSY lock (which the retry loop WAITS on). A kill is surfaced honestly, never
 *            masked, and does NOT retry the BUSY way (a hang retried is just another hang).
