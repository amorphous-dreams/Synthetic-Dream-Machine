/**
 * The HOUSE's home — `~/.local/share/lararium`, the shrine a family fed across generations and left
 * standing when they moved.
 *
 * THE CRITERION IS WHOSE IT IS. What lands here belongs to the LARARIUM rather than to any Lar: the
 * acquired shelf, and the sensoriums that hold operator history and DreamNet history. LARES PASS; THE
 * LARARIUM ABIDES — a Lar wakes, acts and gives way, and the substrate under `lares/` gives way with it,
 * reforged whole by `clear`, `bake` and `rebirth`. That the house's things also survive every rite reads
 * as the CONSEQUENCE of whose they are, never the reason: an acquired body has no author in any tracked
 * tree and no parse∘render fixed point, and a sensorium holds capture the machine took once and cannot
 * take again, so nothing rebuilds either and a wipe reaching them would end them.
 *
 * Belonging makes the wipe zone STRUCTURAL. A tier that survives because a directory is not on a list
 * survives until somebody edits the list; a tier standing in its own house needs no list at all.
 *
 * ONE VOCABULARY IN BOTH CONTEXTS. Under `LAR_ROOT` every directory names an XDG KIND — data, state,
 * cache, config, run — and the two HOUSES nest inside the data kind exactly as they do under XDG:
 * `<root>/data/lares` beside `<root>/data/lararium`, `$XDG_DATA_HOME/lares` beside
 * `$XDG_DATA_HOME/lararium`. A house never stands where a kind belongs, so an isolated root reads as the
 * real disk with a different prefix, and a test never reaches the operator's own shelf.
