/**
 * holder-cap — the ONE env-cap composer every mempalace-backed python spawn wears.
 *
 * A holder spawn carries CAPS the same way a vessel does: each cap contributes env, the spawn spreads
 * them, and a spawn that forgets one runs under-capped. Eleven spawn sites spread the GPU
 * compute cap individually; this composes the full set behind ONE name, so a NEW spawn site reaches for
 * `resolveHolderCapEnv` and gets every cap the House declares — never the subset whoever wrote it
 * remembered.
 *
 * The composer caps BOTH shores: the House's own NDJSON holders under @lararium/sensorium's scripts,
 * and the read-only spawn of the guest mempalace holder. Each opens a store through the mempalace
 * library, so each answers to the same declared policy.
 *
 * ── THE WRITE-ROUTING CAP, and why the House declares it ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * mempalace resolves its write route down a seven-rung ladder (docs/write-routing-policy.md). Rungs 4-6
 * read the GUEST config file at `~/.mempalace/config.json` — a store the House does not own. So a House
 * that declares NOTHING inherits the guest install's policy the day one appears: a cross-boundary read
 * the peer boundary exists to refuse.
 *
 * The env rungs sit ABOVE every config rung, so DECLARING cures it whole. The House declares.
 *
 * ── WHY `require` RATHER THAN `prefer` (operator context, 2026-07-29) ───────────────────────────────
 * Operators run MANY chat-session worldlines in parallel, across different agents and backends, all
 * writing one sensorium. That names the multi-writer case, and the policies part exactly there:
 *
 *   · `prefer` uses the daemon when it stands and FALLS BACK TO A DIRECT WRITER otherwise — which means
 *     it re-opens multi-writer access at the precise moment contention peaks (daemon busy, or starting).
 *   · `require` routes every write through the daemon or BLOCKS. Paired with the daemon-singleton flock
 *     (one daemon per palace), it yields single-writer discipline that holds under load.
 *
 * The flock guarantees ONE daemon exists; only `require` guarantees every write goes THROUGH it. The
 * asymmetry decides it: a stalled write retries, and a corrupted vector index does not — concurrent
 * writers on one HNSW segment damage a store no later run repairs.
 *
 * HONEST COST, stated: under `require` a daemon that cannot start stops writes rather than degrading to
 * a direct path. That reads as the correct trade in a civic mesh (a lost write costs more than a stalled
 * one) and as the WRONG one for a latency-bound caller — which keeps this an override, never a
 * weld: an operator who exports `MEMPALACE_WRITE_ROUTING` wins, exactly as the compute cap yields to a
 * pinned `MEMPALACE_EMBEDDING_DEVICE`.
