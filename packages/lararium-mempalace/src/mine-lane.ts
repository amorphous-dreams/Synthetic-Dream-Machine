/**
 * mine-lane — the SINGLE-WRITER lane per palace (in-process). Every ASYNC mine subprocess
 * rides a keyed promise-chain tail — key = the canonical palace path — so two concurrent
 * mines against ONE palace SERIALIZE (a work queue: queue, never drop/coalesce) instead of
 * racing the chroma hnsw compactor (the 20 transient compaction faults under concurrent
 * mines). The shape: one Map of tails, no timers, no config — the lane's pace derives
 * entirely from each mine's own completion.
 *
 * Scope (honest): this lane serializes within ONE process. Cross-process serialization
 * already rides the palace lock + the shared busy-retry (mine-retry.ts) and mempalace's own
 * write-daemon queue — the lane keeps a process from racing ITSELF into that lock (the
 * lock-retry storm). SYNC spawns (execFileSync callers: subagent-mine, telemetry-writeback,
 * the CLI direct mine) block the thread and thus serialize by construction; the lane guards
 * the async spawns (the daemon capture flush, any future async mine).
