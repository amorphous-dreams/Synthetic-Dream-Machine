/**
 * palace-path — ONE canonical spelling for a physical mempalace.
 *
 * The mempalace write-daemon (`mempalace mine … --daemon`) keys its single-holder
 * singleton off the palace path. The SAME physical palace addressed by DIFFERENT
 * spellings (a symlinked parent, a `..` segment, a relative vs absolute form, a
 * trailing slash) hashed to DISTINCT keys → multiple write-daemons → palace-lock
 * starvation (the daemon pile-up root).
 *
 * The cure: canonicalize at OUR single point of use, so one physical palace = one
 * spelling = one holder. `realpathSync.native` resolves symlinks AND normalizes;
 * before the palace dir exists (first boot, before the daemon creates it) it throws
 * ENOENT, so we fall back to `resolve()` — which still collapses `.`, `..`, and
 * relative spellings. Once the dir exists the realpath wins and stabilizes.
 *
 * NOTE on the live daemon: a running write-daemon started under a NON-canonical
 * spelling will not be matched by the canonical one — canonicalizing while it is
 * live would spawn a SECOND daemon. The canonical spelling therefore takes effect
 * on the NEXT daemon restart; never start a competing daemon against a running one.
