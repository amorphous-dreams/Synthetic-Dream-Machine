/**
 * mine-retry — the SHARED retry-on-busy helper for every writer that drives a `mempalace mine`.
 *
 * The palace lock is the cross-process coordination: ONE held lock means another writer (a live
 * daemon flush, a concurrent backfill, a per-spirit mine) is mid-mine. `MineAlreadyRunning` /
 * `LockHeldByOtherProcess` / `is held by PID` is a BUSY signal, not an error (exactly SQLite's
 * SQLITE_BUSY) — the caller MUST WAIT and retry, never FAIL. We back off (exponential + full
 * jitter) and re-run, so the daemon flush, the bulk backfill, and the per-spirit mine coexist
 * gracefully through the one lock. A NON-busy error throws straight through (the caller's own
 * durability — WAL re-queue, honest "mine-failed" — owns it).
 *
 * Thunk-based (inject the closure, not an interface): each caller owns its own exe resolution,
 * argv, options, and test shore; this module owns ONLY the busy-detect + backoff + retry loop.
 *
 * The `*WithServo` variants COMPOSE the self-tuning timeout servo (mine-timeout) ON TOP of the
 * busy-retry: each attempt runs under an adaptive `timeout` (the thunk passes it to execFileSync),
 * its duration is learned on completion, and a HANG (killed by the timeout) follows a DISTINCT path
 * from a BUSY lock — a busy lock WAITS+retries, a hang retries at most
 * once (a hang retried the same way is just another hang) then surfaces honestly as MineHangError.
