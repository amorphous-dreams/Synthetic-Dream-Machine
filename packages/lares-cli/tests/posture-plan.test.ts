/**
 * posture-plan — what `lares vessel stand` does with a flag the chosen posture cannot carry.
 *
 * ── THE SEAM ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * One verb, four postures, four handlers. The default reads `--observe`, `--init`, `--install`,
 * `--admit` and the four surface flags; `--foreground` reads four other things; `--with-web` reads
 * NOTHING AT ALL. So a flag typed beside the wrong posture vanishes — no warning, exit 0, and a
 * reader who watched the command succeed believes it did what they asked.
 *
 * ── WHY `--observe` REFUSES WHERE THE OTHERS WARN ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Observing is not a preference. It is a VOW that the run touches nothing, and callers lean on it —
 * harnesses, hooks, the wake report. `--observe --foreground` dropped that vow and booted a node:
 * the one flag whose silent loss inverts its own meaning. It refuses.
 *
 * Everything else names what it dropped and carries on, because a person who typed one extra flag
 * wants the vessel standing more than they want a lecture.
