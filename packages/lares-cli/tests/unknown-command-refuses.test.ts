/**
 * AN UNKNOWN NAME REFUSES — WITH OR WITHOUT `--help`.
 *
 * The vessel collapse retired fourteen spellings and keeps no aliases, and its own verification reads
 * *no old name answers*. That check is only performable from outside if a name that does not answer
 * REFUSES: routing an unknown command to the global menu returns 0 and prints a full page, which reads
 * exactly like a door that opened.
 *
 * Measured before this test existed: a probe of `lares wake --help` reported four retired verbs as
 * ANSWERING, because `--help` on a name outside the table fell through to the global-help branch. The
 * control — a nonsense verb — printed the identical page and exited 0, which is what named the defect.
 * So the control rides here beside the retired spellings: without it, this file could pass against a
 * binary that answers everything.
