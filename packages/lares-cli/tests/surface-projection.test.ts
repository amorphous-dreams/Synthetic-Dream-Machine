/**
 * surface-projection — one command table, many faces, and the signing hand that stays human.
 *
 * A second surface keeping a second catalogue drifts from the plane it claims to expose, and the drift stays
 * invisible until it bites: a verb an agent reaches and a human cannot, or the reverse. So every face reads
 * ONE declaration, held beside the handler.
 *
 * The arms that carry weight: every key-holding command drops from the EXECUTABLE view (an agent surface
 * built the ordinary way cannot reach a signing act) · the agent surface stays EMPTY until a hand declares
 * a verb onto it (a surface exposes what asked to be exposed) · and the whole CLI still projects, so the
 * declaration added no gate a human has to pass.
