/**
 * THE HELP REGISTRY NAMES ONLY COMMANDS THAT EXIST.
 *
 * The registry is SPARSE by design — a command without an entry renders its dispatch summary — so a
 * missing entry is legal and silent. The reverse is not: an entry for a command nobody can run reaches
 * no reader, contradicts nothing, and fails no build. It simply rots, and the surface it describes is
 * the one an operator would have trusted.
 *
 * The vessel collapse left exactly two behind (`status`, `wake`), which is how this test came to exist.
