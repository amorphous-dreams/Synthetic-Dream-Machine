/**
 * THE TWO DIGEST IMPLEMENTATIONS MUST AGREE, or the gate rebuilds forever and looks like nothing.
 *
 * `tools/stamp-build.mjs` writes the stamp (it runs before the CLI exists, so it cannot import from it);
 * `build-freshness.ts` reads it. A drift between them makes every stamp read as a mismatch — so the gate
 * rebuilds on every lifecycle verb, mid-run, which is exactly the disturbance the content digest was
 * introduced to end. And the loop is SILENT: each build succeeds, each stamp gets written, and nothing
 * reports that the two never once agreed.
 *
 * The duplication is deliberate (a bootstrap needs it). This test is the price it pays.
