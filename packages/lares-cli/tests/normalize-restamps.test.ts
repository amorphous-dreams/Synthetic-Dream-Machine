/**
 * normalize re-stamps — the door leaves no carrier holding a check its body does not match.
 *
 * FRAMING RIDES INSIDE THE CHECKED SPAN, so canonicalizing a carrier moves the very bytes its check
 * covers. A door that stamps nothing therefore reports `canonical` on a carrier it just made
 * non-canonical, and `meme check` — the form a CI gate runs — exits 0 on it. The silence is total: every
 * other law still holds, so nothing else in the suite has anything to say. Any sweep that edits
 * carrier bodies and then normalizes rests on this test.
 *
 * DRIVEN THROUGH THE BUILT BINARY, never the helper. This law lives in what the command composes;
 * `bccOf` satisfies it alone and can agree with nothing that calls it. A unit test over the helper
 * passes on a door that never calls it, which makes the binary the only honest witness.
