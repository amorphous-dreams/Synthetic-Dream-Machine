/**
 * exit-drains-stdout — the CLI must not discard its own answer on the way out.
 *
 * ── THE DEFECT THIS HOLDS SHUT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `process.stdout` is ASYNCHRONOUS on a pipe and synchronous on a file. `process.exit()` returns
 * immediately and drops whatever has not drained, so a large result survives `> file` and truncates
 * through `| pipe` — silently, mid-string, with exit code 0.
 *
 * Measured on a real 2,718-record `--json` result: 165,256 bytes into a file, 146,176 through a pipe,
 * `SyntaxError: Unterminated string`. The isolated shape truncates at exactly one pipe buffer: 400,021
 * bytes to a file, 65,536 through a pipe.
 *
 * `--json` exists, in this CLI's own help, "for agents/pipes" — the one sink that loses bytes. Every
 * agent reading this CLI through a pipe was reading a possibly-truncated answer.
 *
 * ── WHY A SOURCE GUARD RATHER THAN A LIVE PIPE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Reproducing it end-to-end needs a command whose JSON exceeds a pipe buffer, which needs a fed
 * vessel and a daemon — a ten-minute suite for a one-line property. The property is structural, so
 * this reads the BUILT entry point and holds the shape there. It runs in milliseconds and rides
 * `pnpm -r test`, where the e2e harness that first caught this deliberately does not.
