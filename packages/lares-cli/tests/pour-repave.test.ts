/**
 * pour --all — the sovereign re-pave, as one door over three legs.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE MOTION IS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Filling a sensorium from what the operator's AI tools have written takes three passes, and they
 * are not interchangeable: DRAWERS land the verbatim content, the BEARING writeback reads those
 * drawers and stamps the navigational gradient onto them, and the PROJECTION re-derives the lexical
 * and entity view over the content plane. The second reads what the first wrote, so the order is a
 * dependency rather than a preference.
 *
 * ── WHY THE ORDER IS ASSERTED, NOT ASSUMED ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The three legs answer at three doors, and a person who runs them out of order gets a clean exit
 * over an empty stamp — a writeback across drawers that do not exist yet reports zero harvested and
 * calls it success. One door holds the order so nobody has to know it.
 *
 * The wing is asserted for the same reason: two verbs that fill ONE palace derived their default
 * wing two different ways, so an unflagged re-pave split its own corpus across two names.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS SUITE SITES ITS OWN SCRATCH `LAR_ROOT` ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `repaveWing`'s fallback reaches `larRoot()`, which on a fresh clone — no `LAR_ROOT`, no
 * `LAR_DEV_REPO_ROOT`, no local `lar-dev-root.json` marker (the marker is gitignored by design, see
 * `env.ts`) — throws a clean "no corpus root sited" error rather than defaulting. A unit here must
 * never lean on that marker, which stands only on a developer's own checkout: every test below sites
 * its own scratch `LAR_ROOT` and asserts the wing THAT root derives, so the suite reads green on a
 * bare clone exactly as it does on a machine that happens to carry the marker.
