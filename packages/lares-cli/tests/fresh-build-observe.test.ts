/**
 * A READING NEVER TRIGGERS A BUILD — and the reason runs deeper than tidiness.
 *
 * The fresh-build gate exists because founding or booting from a stale dist runs superseded logic against
 * real identity. A caller holding the observe cap alone founds nothing and boots nothing, so that danger
 * cannot arise — and the rebuild is far from free to attempt anyway: `pnpm -r build` CLEANS dist first,
 * so a probe that triggered one deletes the modules out from under any daemon already running.
 *
 * Measured, when a rehearsal's liveness check reached for `wake`: the gate fired, the build cleaned dist,
 * and the running node lost `node-host.js` mid-flight. The probe killed what it was measuring, then
 * reported it dead. A reading that disturbs what it reads measures its own footprint.
