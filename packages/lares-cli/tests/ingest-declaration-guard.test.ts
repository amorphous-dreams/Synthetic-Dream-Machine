/**
 * ingest-declaration-guard — a bag's OWN declaration is DISK-OWNED and never becomes a record.
 *
 * Seeded, `meta.mem` would land in the bag's document and then round-trip through the projection — after
 * which a wiki edit could re-home the bag or loosen its cap-tier. A declaration a rendered surface can move
 * is a declaration nothing holds, so the authority stays on disk where `lares bag declare` writes it.
 *
 * The exclusion is ROOT-SCOPED on purpose: a meme deeper in a bag's tree may legitimately carry that name,
 * and excluding it everywhere would silently swallow authored content.
