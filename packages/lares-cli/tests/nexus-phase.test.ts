/**
 * nexus-phase — a Nexus begins at a RELATION, and says so before one exists.
 *
 * ── THE KEEPER LADDER, AS CANON WRITES IT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `genesis-doc`: "founder (n=1, genesis) -> founder-multisig (a 2nd keeper contracts in -> write
 * delegates to a GROUP; the group, not the original key, becomes root) -> k-of-n quorum". Phase 2 is
 * reached by a SECOND KEEPER CONTRACTING IN, never by the founder seating more of their own faces.
 *
 * ── WHY THE COUNT CANNOT DECIDE THE PHASE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A founding seat draws its keys from ONE vault — `listPersonaRoots` reads this vessel's own identity
 * home and can read nothing else. So three seated chairs at genesis are three faces of one operator:
 * "cryptographically real and not real as a check — no independent hand can refuse" (first-realm-arc),
 * and the same meme instructs that this be RECORDED as the honest founding state rather than allowed
 * to read as a distributed quorum.
 *
 * Under relationship-as-identity the reason is sharper than a warning about optics: with one operator
 * there is one relationship — the operator with themselves — however many keys they hold. The second
 * OPERATOR is the first relation, and the relation is what a Nexus is.
 *
 * So this reads foreign contracts, and treats seat count as saying nothing about phase at all.
