/**
 * nexus-seal-lineage — the CLI ceremony for the PRE-ROTATED charter-epoch chain (#68), driven end-to-end
 * through a REAL persona vault + the bags/nexus charter DOC on disk.
 *
 * Proven:
 *   · seat establishes the GENESIS epoch (sequence 0, null prev) with a pre-rotation commitment + raises a
 *     live quorum, all through the vault (pet-name match → seated verifying keys → chain head),
 *   · seat FAILS CLOSED against re-seating a chain that has already ROTATED past genesis,
 *   · rotate REVEALS the vault key-set, verifies it against the head's pre-commitment, and APPENDS a
 *     hash-linked epoch1 (the seat→rotate round-trip),
 *   · a rotate whose reveal does NOT match the head's pre-commitment REFUSES (nonzero) and writes NOTHING
 *     (the chain stays at epoch0) — the fail-closed floor.
 *
 * The reveal-verify SEMANTICS (accept/refuse on the digest, the pre-rotation guard) are exhaustively proven
 * at the mesh layer (wax-stamp.test); this file proves the CLI WIRING over a genuine vault + disk.
