 * render — one surface, two actors (meme: lar:///…/mesh/operator-peer #actor-parity).
 *
 * The same command serves a HUMAN at a terminal and an AI AGENT acting
 * programmatically. Output renders by audience, never by forking the command:
 *   - TTY (human)            → prose, via the caller's `human()` thunk.
 *   - `--json` or off-TTY    → a deterministic structured payload on stdout:
 *                              an `ok | error` union carrying the correlatable
 *                              `requestId` (the content-addressed task handle)
 *                              and a `data` map. Errors travel as DATA (one
 *                              parseable object), not a stack trace.
 *
 * Determinism: the payload object literal builds in fixed key order, so the same
 * result emits the same bytes — what an agent relies on.
