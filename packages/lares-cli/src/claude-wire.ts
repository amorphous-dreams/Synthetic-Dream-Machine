/**
 * claude-wire — `lares vessel stand --claude`: wire the Lares hooks into ~/.claude/settings.json (so a Claude
 * harness auto-wakes on SessionStart and auto-keeps verbatim memory on Stop/SessionEnd) and register
 * the LARES MCP seat in ~/.claude.json (so recall reaches the memory sensorium THROUGH the lares
 * house). Any stale `mempalace` MCP registration is reaped in the same pass — a harness holding its
 * own palace holder reaches past the node into the store, and N sessions on one Chroma index is the
 * contention that truncated the HNSW segment.
 *
 * Pono shape: a DEEP MERGE that PRESERVES everything already in settings.json (the
 * operator's permissions, model, theme, …). Idempotent — a hook already pointing at
 * our script is left untouched. The hooks reference the repo's plugin scripts by
 * ABSOLUTE path (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` does not expand in settings.json), so the
 * plugin files stay in the repo; home just points at them. A `.bak` is written
 * before any change, and the result is JSON-validated before it replaces the file.
