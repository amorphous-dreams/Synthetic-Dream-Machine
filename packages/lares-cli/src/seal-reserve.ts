/**
 * seal-reserve — the compromise-resistant custody for the charter pre-rotation's NEXT key-set.
 *
 * KERI pre-rotation commits an epoch to a DIGEST of the next epoch's keys before those keys ever sign
 * (wax-stamp: `sealKeySetHash`, `nextKeyCommit`). This module forges the seed those next keys derive
 * FROM, and custodies it so an operator-full-compromise reveals nothing:
 *
 *   · the reserve seed rides a SEPARATE 32-byte CSPRNG seed — NEVER the live persona-root signing seed —
 *     so a thief of today's signing key learns zero about tomorrow's keys (independent seeds), and
 *   · the next epoch's THREE kahu keypairs derive HARDENED from it via SLIP-0010 ed25519 (persona-hd:
 *     `derivePersonaKeypair`, every path segment HMAC-SHA512 hardened) along a domain-separated path, so
 *     a derived child key never climbs back to the seed (hardened blocks the public-parent attack), and
 *   · the reserve seed itself Shamir-splits 2-of-3 (recovery-share, the impersonation-quorum floor) across
 *     THREE DISTINCT custodian slots — "mine" (the operator, vessel-sealed) + two guardians — so ANY two
 *     shares reconstruct, and the two guardians recover WITHOUT the operator (the two shares carry DISTINCT
 *     custodian tags, satisfying the ≥2-distinct-custodian quorum wall).
 *
 * The 2-of-3 card SHAPE + the confirmation handshake live in `guardian-card` — the SHARED primitive personal
 * identity recovery (recovery-keel-core) issues too, so the guardians who hold a citizen's reserve cards
 * hold the SAME card shape that helps recover their identity (one pattern integrity, two uses).
 *
 * A-MULTITUDE-OF-ONE (founding): the operator IS all three kahu, so ONE reserve seed derives the whole
 * next key-set coherently, and Share 1 ("mine") is the operator's — the vessel-sealed copy, the printed
 * card, and any emailed copy all carry the SAME Share 1, so an operator-full-compromise reveals exactly
 * ONE share → nothing. (CABAL-SCALE evolution surfaced to the operator: each kahu holding their OWN reserve
 * seed splits this shore per-kahu; the founding one-seed case sits at handleIndex 0 of that generalization.)
