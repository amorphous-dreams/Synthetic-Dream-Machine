/**
 * found — the idempotent founding orchestration behind `lares vessel stand --install`.
 *
 * Stands up the whole shebang from a (mostly) fresh pull — node build, mempalace
 * integration, social-plane init, genesis — by COMPOSING the existing commands,
 * each FOUND-IF-ABSENT and a NO-OP-IF-PRESENT. Running it twice is a pure no-op.
 *
 * Safety law (the keypair-wipe lesson generalized):
 *  - the plan is computed by file PRESENCE alone (read-only); only absent steps run;
 *  - the operator keypair is load-or-create — never wiped (node-vessel-identity.ts);
 *  - `lares vessel found` self-guards on the bootstrap (skips the ceremony if present);
 *  - genesis is BUILD-IF-ABSENT ONLY — a rebuild can shift the CID and diverge a
 *    founded identity, so re-founding stays an explicit operator act (`vessel clear`), never
 *    a stand. `--install` never passes `--force`.
