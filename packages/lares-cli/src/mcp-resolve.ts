/**
 * mcp-resolve — resolve the LARES MCP seat the harness-wire modules register, plus the shared
 * WireAction vocabulary.
 *
 * A harness reaches memory through the LARES surface (`lares_mcp.py` — FastMCP over the sensorium
 * lifecycle), and that surface holds NO STORE: every verb rides the daemon cap-wire (`lares_uds.py`)
 * to the one process that owns the palace holders.
 *
 * THE TOOL LIST LIVES IN `lares_mcp.py` AND NOWHERE ELSE. This header once named nine verbs while the
 * surface carried thirty — a hand-written list cannot notice what it missed, and it read as
 * authoritative to whoever found it. `tools/surface-parity-witness.sh` derives the count and holds the
 * invariant that matters: every MCP tool answers to a CLI door.
 *
 * THE CONVERSE IS A RULING, NOT A GAP. The CLI carries the KEY-HOLDING ceremonies — founding, persona
 * minting, the charter quorum, the vault past a status read, the raise — and MCP carries none of them.
 * MCP speaks stdio-per-client, so N sessions run N processes; handing that surface a signing verb would
 * put N unsynchronised holders on one operator's keys. The operator's hand keeps those.
 *
 * MCP speaks stdio-per-client, so N sessions run N of these processes. A surface that opened a chroma
 * client would therefore put N unsynchronized writers on one index — and no lock cures that, because
 * the serve-holders speak NDJSON on raw stdin and answer only their spawning parent. Exactly ONE OWNER
 * holds the palace, and everyone else asks it. All the compute stays py; the daemon only routes.
 *
 * The guest `~/.mempalace` holds no seat here. An operator raises it deliberately (`lares mempalace
 * setup`) and imports FROM it (`guest-import.ts`); the vessel never binds into it.
 *
 * `reaped` / `absent`: a wire leg removes any mempalace registration it finds beside registering the
 * lares one, so a harness config converges on the one owner whatever state it arrives in.
