/**
 * boot-pointer — the one line each harness reads at wake, and the law that keeps it aimed.
 *
 * Every harness loads a file at session start and hydrates the house from what it names. Those files
 * live in four different homes under three different spellings, and NOTHING TENDED THEM: when the
 * carrier moved, three homes went on naming a path that no longer stood.
 *
 * THAT FAILURE IS SILENT BY CONSTRUCTION. A pointer aimed at a missing file does not error — the
 * harness wakes, finds nothing behind the link, and reports a clean start. The node comes up without
 * the house and says nothing about why, which is the one failure mode a health line cannot show.
 *
 * So presence never satisfies this check. A pointer counts as tended only when it names THE CARRIER,
 * and a pointer naming anything else gets re-aimed — the file's existence says nothing about where it
 * points, and existence is exactly what the old checks tested.
 *
 * A POINTER, NEVER A COPY. A copied seed is a second seed: it reads correct the day it is written and
 * drifts from the carrier every day after, with nothing watching it. The pointer costs one indirection
 * and buys a single source.
 *
 * The spellings differ because the harnesses do — Claude expands `@path` as an include, Codex and
 * Copilot follow a markdown link — so the RENDERING is per-harness and the LAW is not.
