/**
 * `lares vessel stand` — the boot ENTRY POINT. Idempotent on every awakening: it ATTACHES to a live Lararium
 * node or STANDS one detached when none answers (never a restart), CHECKS the mempalace sidecar, and
 * emits a live-delta hydration frame for the waking session.
 *
 * IT CARRIES TWO CAPABILITIES, AND `--observe` WITHHOLDS THE SECOND. Observing reports what stands and
 * touches nothing; standing brings a node up, founds a vessel, wires the AI surfaces. An unattended
 * caller — a session hook, a cron, anything that only wants a reading — holds the first alone, so
 * looking never decides what stands.
 *
 * FOUNDING STANDS THE VESSEL AND NOTHING ELSE (operator ruling). The mempalace library and
 * the sensorium organs keep their own doors (`lares mempalace install`, `lares sense setup`), so a
 * founding stays isolated to the vessel root. A stand still REPORTS what stands, because naming a missing
 * tool serves the operator and installing one behind them does not.
 *
 * The static CLAUDE.md @-import carries the canonical seed; this frame carries
 * only what is true right now. A degraded wake still returns 0 — the entry point
 * never hard-fails the session (the `ok` field tells the truth).
