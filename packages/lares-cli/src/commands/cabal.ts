/**
 * `lares cabal <vouch | feed | clock>` — the three doors onto a cabal-realm: stake standing on a joiner, make
 * the offering that keeps a realm alive, and read who feeds it.
 *
 * `vouch <joiner-nym> --realm <realm-doc-id> [--expires <iso>] [--as <n>]` — the JOIN axis's
 * write side: one held face stakes its OWN standing on one joiner, onto the Nexus vouch board.
 *
 * THE CONTRAST WITH `nexus contract`. Contracting a vessel into carriage needs the kahu quorum AND the
 * joiner's own consent — a Nexus may not conscript, and no single kahu seats a carrier alone. A vouch runs the
 * other axis entirely: ONE hand, its OWN standing, no steward asked. The two relations run orthogonal — a
 * human may contract without joining, join without contracting, hold both, or neither.
 *
 * IT ADMITS NOBODY. A vouch rides as signal-2 on the lineage and grants nothing by itself; the crossing prices it
 * later. The vouching itself already paid the cost: the voucher's score SPLITS across everyone they
 * vouch for, so each vouch dilutes the hand that made it. That carries the whole payment, and it needs no ledger.
 *
 * `feed --realm <id> [--as <n>]` — THE OFFERING. A realm lives by being fed: members roll a per-realm lease
 * epoch, one slot per writer, and the realm's liveness reads off that max-register. A FACE feeds, never a
 * device, so adding vessels never inflates a standing. Feeding twice rolls twice — the clock measures how hard
 * each hand feeds, so a repeated offering SHOULD register.
 *
 * `clock --realm <id>` — THE CAPTURE-CLOCK, and it surfaces rather than judges. It reports who feeds and how
 * deep, the spread between leaders and trailers, and how many sit at the leading edge — raw numbers, no
 * "captured" verdict. A minority out-feeding a realm becomes VISIBLE while exit still costs little, which is
 * the whole answer available here: sight plus fork-as-exit, never a gate. The gate would become the captured
 * object.
 *
 * WHAT THE NUMBERS CANNOT SAY. Both verbs read what THIS REPLICA has synced. A maintainer whose roll has not
 * arrived reads as absent, and a realm nobody here has synced reads as unfed — under no-global-now those two
 * generate identically, so the reading names a local sighting and never a total.
