/**
 * posture-plan — which posture `lares vessel stand` takes, and what that posture cannot carry.
 *
 * ── ONE VERB, FOUR HANDLERS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Standing a vessel runs one motion, but the postures reach it through four different programs, and
 * each program reads a different slice of the command line. A flag typed beside the wrong one lands
 * nowhere: no warning, exit 0, and the person who ran it has every reason to believe it took.
 *
 * This table is the only place that knows the difference. It reads NAMES, touches nothing, and
 * returns a plan a caller can print — so the drop becomes a sentence instead of a silence.
 *
 * ── THE ONE REFUSAL ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `--observe` vows the run has no effects, and harnesses, hooks and the wake report lean on that
 * vow. Dropped, it does not degrade — it INVERTS, booting the daemon the caller asked about. So it
 * refuses beside an acting posture. Every other drop warns and stands, because a person who typed
 * one extra flag wants their vessel up more than they want a wall.
