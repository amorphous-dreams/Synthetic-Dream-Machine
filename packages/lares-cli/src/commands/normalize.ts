/**
 * `lares carrier normalize <file.mem ...> [--check]`
 *
 * The normalize gesture — canonicalize a meme carrier's framing so the
 * round-trip lens laws hold (meme-corpus-roundtrip: single-closer · content-
 * whole · idempotent). The doctrine: corpus files are "non-canonical at rest
 * until a deliberate normalization commit" (wiki-layer-ontology). Author freely;
 * run this before committing a new carrier — the gate stays strict, the
 * authoring stays graceful.
 *
 * Two classes ride it. A carrier's meta-declared `namespace` homes into its SOH opener as literal
 * glyphs — the class a hand-authored carrier most often trips. A declaration naming the grammar's
 * address and not its name takes the current one, from the authority beside the type constant. The
 * transform is pure + idempotent (`@lararium/tw5/meme-normalize`).
 *
 *   --check     report carriers that WOULD change; write nothing. Exit 1 if any
 *               drift — for CI / pre-commit gates.
 *   --gradient  read how far down the ingest gradient each file sits, and write nothing.
 *   --edges     read the addresses these carriers point AT, and which of them answer.
 *
 * ── WHY `--edges` LOOKS OUTWARD ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `--gradient` asks whether a carrier is whole. Nothing asked whether the graph it points into exists,
 * because a `lar:` URI names and does not fetch: a carrier whose target moved keeps rendering, keeps
 * round-tripping, and passes every gate this tree stands.
 *
 * Run it BEFORE a move and again after. Equal counts prove the weld held; a rise names what broke.
 *
 * ── WHY `--gradient` IS A SEPARATE READING ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `--check` asks whether a carrier is CANONICAL. It cannot ask whether a carrier is WHOLE, because
 * graceful parsing means a file missing its address, its declaration, or its whole body frame still
 * parses, still renders, and still round-trips — it just does so as something smaller than a meme.
 *
 * That mercy hides files. A carrier without `uri-path` is skipped by every corpus gate at
 * `if (!uri) continue`, so a sweep reports 601 of 618 while calling itself corpus-wide, and the
 * seventeen it never opened stay invisible for as long as nobody counts.
 *
 * So this reading names the KIND a file declares itself to be, and the marks that kind requires and
 * lacks. It fails on a fault, never on a kind: a bag descriptor carrying no body frame stands exactly
 * where it should.
