/**
 * `lares edge {kapae | un-kapae} <edge-id> --epoch-cid <cid> [--as <root-index>] [--version <n>]` — set one
 * RELATIONSHIP aside, or take the marker back down.
 *
 * SCOPED UNDER `edge` to mirror `nexus kapae` / `nexus un_kapae`, and to keep them apart. Both acts set
 * something aside and both deserve the word, but they set aside DIFFERENT KINDS of thing: the nexus pair
 * shadows a PRESENTER on the antigen board under a kahu quorum, while this pair shadows one RELATIONSHIP
 * under whichever key holds it. One bare `kapae` covering both would read as a single act with two
 * meanings — the pet-name failure this house keeps catching.
 *
 * The marker rides an EDGE, never a party. Setting a relationship aside says nothing about either end of it:
 * a vessel keeps standing, a face keeps standing, and only THAT relation stops counting. Every comparable
 * system raises its tombstone over a party instead, which is why each needed the whole world to agree.
 *
 * RAISING WINS A TIE; LOWERING TAKES A DELIBERATE HAND. Under partition two peers may disagree and the raised
 * marker holds the merge, so an eviction never quietly reverses when the partition heals. Nothing un-shadows
 * by accident — a lower is its own signed act, and it lands in the record beside the raise it supersedes.
 *
 * THE WRITE ASSERTS NO AUTHORITY. It signs with a named persona root; whether that root holds the edge gets
 * decided by whichever reader consults the shadow. A raise by a root with no claim lands, verifies, and gets
 * dropped everywhere it matters.
