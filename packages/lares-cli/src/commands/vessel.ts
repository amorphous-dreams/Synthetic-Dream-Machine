/**
 * `lares vessel` — THE VESSEL DOOR. One namespace for the vessel's own causal island.
 *
 * ── THE LAW THIS ENACTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ONE NAMESPACE PER CAUSAL ISLAND; THE PLANE IS A PARAMETER, NEVER A NEW VERB. That law already
 * governs every other plane in this CLI — `nexus`, `persona`, `vault`, `library`, `circle`, `cabal`,
 * `sense`, `sensorium` each hold one door over one island. The vessel — its store, its genesis
 * artifact, its daemon, its corpus — forms an island by every test this house applies, and it holds
 * this door. A door absorbs new capability; a plane with no door has nowhere to put it but the top,
 * and that is how a top-level verb count grows back.
 *
 * ── SIX PRIMITIVES + ONE READ ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A primitive names ONE motion and cannot be expressed as a sequence of the others. Everything else
 * composes, and a composition earns a pet-name rather than a top-level name:
 *
 *   stop   ends a running daemon by port, graceful then forced — never a restart in disguise
 *   clear  pares the vessel store + the projection watermark — identity, seal, library and registry
 *          stand outside it
 *   found  mints the vessel identity, the persona root, the social planes and the bootstrap —
 *          idempotent, skips what stands
 *   stand  brings the daemon up, foreground or detached, and reports what it found
 *   seed   plants every bags holding back into its doc, kind-routed, diff-gated — idempotent
 *   read   the pure inspection that starts nothing
 *
 * Re-deriving the genesis island is NOT a standalone door: advancing the composition is a MESH act that
 * rides `nexus kahuli` (the engine/grammar ratchet, past a single vessel), and the LOCAL re-derive lives
 * only as an internal step of the rebuild/rebirth rites + the `build:genesis` build script.
 *
 * `build` — compile the workspace and stamp the source digest — rides inside `rite refresh` rather
 * than standing alone: it moves the TREE, not the vessel, and a door over one island should not hold
 * a motion that belongs to the workspace.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS DOOR DOES NOT DO ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It adds and removes NOTHING. Every sub-door hands the operator's own args straight to the handler
 * beneath and changes nothing on the way: behaviour lives in the handlers, dispatch lives here. A door
 * that also moved behaviour could not be verified — a green suite would prove neither half.
