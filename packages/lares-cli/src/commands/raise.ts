/**
 * `lares raise sign <challenge-json> [--as <index>]` — the RECOGNISER's half of the raise ceremony.
 *
 * A vessel standing at the floor emits a challenge. A recognised operator signs it on their OWN machine
 * with their OWN persona root and hands the grant back; the caps that arrive at that vessel ride the
 * recogniser's key, and no key of theirs ever rests on the vessel they raise.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS VERB CARRIES NO `ask` OR `answer` YET, SAID PLAINLY ────────────────────────────────
 * Those two halves belong to the ASKING vessel, and the door that holds them lives in that vessel's
 * running process — a raise is presence, held in memory, never written down. Reaching it from a separate
 * CLI process needs the door registered as a daemon verb, at the `wireVerbs` shore in `open-node-vessel`,
 * which means constructing the door there rather than after the open. That is a boot-path change and it
 * waits for its own pass. Naming a verb here that does not stand would spend a reader's trust the first
 * time they typed it.
 *
 * So: this half runs today and needs no daemon at all. The vessel emits its challenge in its own boot
 * output; hand that text here, hand the grant back.
