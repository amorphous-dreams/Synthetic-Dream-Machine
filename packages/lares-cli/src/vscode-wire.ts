/**
 * vscode-wire — `lares vessel stand --vscode`: register the LARES MCP seat into VS Code, across whichever
 * variants are installed — stable + Insiders, remote-server (WSL/SSH) + local-profile. Backs up
 * before each change; preserves the operator's other servers.
 *
 * The lares house owns this seat. A per-editor *mempalace* MCP lets each editor open the palace
 * itself, and Chroma tolerates one writer — N harnesses on one index is the contention that truncates
 * the HNSW segment and forces a drift-quarantine. So VS Code reaches memory THROUGH the lares house
 * (`lares_mcp.py` over the memory sensorium), and a stale mempalace entry is reaped in the same pass,
 * so a profile another wiring touched heals on the next stand.
 *
 * VS Code went native-MCP in v1.102. Schema (DISTINCT from Claude/Cursor's `mcpServers`): top-level
 * key is **`servers`**. Under a remote window the config lives on the remote-server side
 * (.vscode-server data/User), not the local profile — we sweep every present root.
