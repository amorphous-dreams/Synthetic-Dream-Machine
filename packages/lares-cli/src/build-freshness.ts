/**
 * build-freshness — the Fresh-Build Invariant for daemon-lifecycle commands.
 *
 * A `lares` run loads the workspace packages from their BUILT dist. A stale dist
 * silently runs OLD code — and for a found/boot/mutate verb that means founding an
 * identity or booting the daemon with superseded logic — e.g. a `vessel found` against
 * a stale `@lararium/node` dist calls the keyhive ceremony without the signer seed and
 * crashes mid-ceremony, leaving a half-founded vessel.
 *
 * Node caches modules at import, so building MID-process cannot reload them. The only
 * sound cure is **build-then-re-exec**: build the whole workspace, then re-run the SAME
 * command in a FRESH process (clean module cache → loads the just-built dist).
 *
 * Best-practice shape for these CLI-managed daemon verbs:
 *   - Fresh-build invariant — never found/boot from stale dist (this module).
 *   - Idempotent          — every verb re-runs safely (`found` skips-if-founded, `stand`
 *                           attaches-or-starts, the build no-ops when current).
 *   - Fail-loud           — a build failure ABORTS; the daemon never runs from stale code.
 *   - Composable          — install = build + found + stand + wire, each step re-runnable.
 *
 * An invocation `needsFreshBuild` accepts routes through `freshBuildGate` before its handler.
 * The `--skip-build` sentinel marks the re-exec'd child (build already done) so it runs
 * its handler directly — ending the recursion.
