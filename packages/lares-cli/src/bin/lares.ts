/**
 * `lares` — operator CLI entry point.
 *
 * Dispatches subcommands. Adding a new command means: add a handler under
 * src/commands/, add a row to COMMANDS below, and (if the command needs help
 * text) add a description.
 *
 * Architecture notes:
 *   - The CLI dispatches and nothing more. Every command's logic lives in a
 *     library function (typically in @lararium/node), so the same operations
 *     can also run from inside the TW5 vm via the verb-tiddler protocol.
 *   - No HTTP/RPC surface here. CLI ↔ live-node coordination rides a
 *     capability-bearing verb-summons over the daemon's Unix socket, whose
 *     outcome lands as a durable CRDT receipt — web2-free.
 *   - One surface, two actors (operator-peer #actor-parity): the same commands
 *     serve a HUMAN at a TTY and an AI AGENT acting programmatically. Output
 *     renders by audience — prose on a TTY, a deterministic structured payload
 *     under `--json` / off-TTY (see ../render.ts). Authority rides WITH the
 *     intent (capability-bearing verb-summons), never a session or login.
