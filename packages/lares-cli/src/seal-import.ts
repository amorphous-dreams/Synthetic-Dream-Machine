/**
 * seal-import — whether a partner's charter may land here.
 *
 * ── WHY THE PLACEMENT IS LOAD-BEARING ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * An operator cannot consent to a charter she has never seen, so the founding operator's public
 * material — seated keys, threshold, epoch lineage — must reach her before she signs anything. And
 * `accept-carriage` signs a contract-in against whatever charter stands in the seal home it reads.
 *
 * So dropping a partner's `founding-roster.mem` into a seal home that already holds one does not
 * merely add a file: it REPLACES a founding, and every contract-in signed afterwards binds to the
 * wrong epoch. The witness that proves the crossing carries the file with `cp`, onto a vessel with
 * no charter to lose — which is why nothing has met this yet.
 *
 * ── THE RULE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A charter arrives where none stands, or it refuses. Re-importing the same charter passes, because
 * an operator who repeats a step should not be punished for it, and repeating destroys nothing.

 *
 * ── WHY A SEAT MUST ASK ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A joining operator holds the founding operator's charter in her own seal home, because she cannot
 * consent to a charter she has never seen. She also seats her own charter there. A seat that reads
 * the standing doc as its base then APPENDS her chairs to his, and the merged charter seats both.
 *
 * Measured on two vessels: six seated kahu at a threshold of two, so the partner holds quorum over
 * her Nexus using his own keys, with no further act by her. The escalation arrives disguised as the
 * ordinary handoff the runbook instructs.
 *
 * A SEATED chair carries a key and therefore authority; one this vault cannot produce is FOREIGN. An
 * UNSEATED chair carries neither, so it is not foreign and keeping it is what `unstood: "keep"` is
 * for — a declared chair nobody has stood for yet.
 *
 * ── THIS GUARD STANDS ON THE MEASURED HARM, NOT ON A RULING ─────────────────────────────────────
 * No carrier says a seal roster may never hold a key the vessel does not hold. `attestation-plane#3`
 * separates the ATTESTING hand from the HOSTING one, which reads adjacent and governs a different
 * plane; extending it to this would be an inference rather than a ruling, and it sits in a lower
 * register than `kahu.mem`, which describes a Cabal that is multi-human PRECISELY so it "structurally
 * cannot sign as one hand" — over the CORPUS, not over any Nexus's carriage.
 *
 * So the question stays OPEN: whether a seal quorum should ever span two operators. Until it is
 * ruled, this refuses the one shape that was measured to cause harm, and refuses it LOUDLY — naming
 * every foreign chair — so whoever comes to change the rule meets the reason rather than a silence.
