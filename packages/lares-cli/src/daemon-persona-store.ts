/**
 * daemon-persona-store — the persona-backed adapters for a human's OWN-persona names, and the local-first
 * floor beneath them.
 *
 * The pet-name and the declared Handle ride the sovereign persona doc, which the self-slot FLEET-syncs to the
 * operator's own device fleet and never volunteers to a stranger — so a rename lands on every device of the
 * one human. The `seat` claim does NOT ride: a Kahu chair names a seat on a PARTICULAR node, so each node
 * keeps its own.
 *
 * LOCAL-FIRST, NOT DAEMON-REQUIRED. A vessel FOUNDS before it breathes — `lares persona new` runs while no
 * daemon listens — so every write lands on the local fs store FIRST and mirrors to the persona plane when the daemon
 * answers. A read prefers the fleet (a fleet-mate's rename outranks this device's stale copy) and falls back
 * to local when the sock is quiet. That posture reads straight off the causal-islands law: a node acts on its
 * own log and reconciles when a peer appears, never blocking on one.
 *
 * A MIRROR NEVER FAILS THE ACT IT MIRRORS. The local write already landed, so an unreachable or refusing
 * fleet leaves the vessel correct and merely un-carried — and the reverse would be worse than useless: it
 * would fail `persona new` on exactly the vessels that reach no fleet. A Herm, or any vessel whose oracle
 * registry names no persona plane, never REGISTERS these verbs at all (capability-degradation by composition), so
 * "the daemon refused" and "no daemon listening" name the same outcome for the caller: NODE-LOCAL.
 *
 * THE REASON STILL TRAVELS. A read hands back a reached/why pair rather than a bare null, so the caller can
 * print WHY the names stayed home — a quiet sock and a refusing daemon read differently to a human even
 * though both leave the same state. `lares persona sync` carries the names up once the hearth breathes.
