    // clears, so a fresh module registry per file is the only thing returning them to zero. Left
    // implicit, the property disappears the day someone reaches for `isolate: false` for speed —
    // a change that reads as a tuning knob and lands as a correctness change. Written down, it has
    // to be turned off on purpose.
