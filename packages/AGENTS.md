## Network Topology (canonical)

**Lararium** — an operator-held DreamNet peer whose device-and-context composes the persona and document-owning capability stack. A Node-surface or Web-surface assembly can carry that stack; package or process names never confer it. A persona-less assembly can instead hold the Herm floor. Lararia, Herms, and other named-capability peers meet across explicit crossings without a client/server rank.

**Nexus** — a confederated mesh of Lararia sharing a stable internal sync network. Named by community + place (e.g. "Floating Library of Mu, PNW Branch"). The Nexus keypair carries the confederation.

**DreamNet** — the overall super-mesh of all Nexuses: allied, neutral, and oppositional. Opposition lives by design. Cross-Nexus connections travel through explicit brokers and tolerate degraded state.

Within-Nexus sync = Automerge CRDT (reliable). Cross-Nexus = explicit treaty, wild-magic-zone hops (unreliable).

<<~/ahu>>

<<~ ahu #package-map>>

## Package Map (active)

Eight packages carry the stack. Each owns one boundary; cross-cutting work travels through the contracts in `@lararium/mesh`.

**This map names boundaries, never files.** A file inventory here rots the moment the tree moves, and a stale inventory misleads worse than none — read the package's own `src/` for what lives in it.

`@lararium/mesh` carries contracts and graph law. Keep this package TW5-neutral, browser-neutral, and Node-neutral. Shared types, `lar:` URI resolution, capability schemas, the Automerge/composite store law, residency tiers, recipes, causal-island + island-protocol, and the session gradient parser live here. Mesh owns the island `Repo` factory (`makeIslandRepo`); the vessel-opening packages (`node`, `browser`) construct the vessel's own `Repo`. `@lararium/tw5` and `@lares/cli` hold **zero** `@automerge` dependencies — keep it that way.

`@lararium/tw5` carries TiddlyWiki runtime integration: the TW5 VM surface, the island layer, the memetic-wikitext machinery, the verb pipeline, TW5-side stores, and the TW5 wikirules/macros/modules/filters. Holds zero `@automerge` dependencies. Treat disk projection as Node-shaped even when the barrel export exposes it.

`@lararium/node` carries Node-surface capability atoms: local process boot, island plumbing, bag-path + residency law, boot artifacts, the wiki composition family, disk projection, the UDS verb-channel, relay ingress, and the oracle read-face. A Node-surface assembly can compose a persona-bearing Lararium stack or a persona-less Herm stack; its process name does not decide that. The runtime **finds**; it never seeds social state. No TW5 VM runs on the main thread — every engine lives in a worker.

`@lararium/browser` carries browser-native capability atoms that parallel the shared keel through WebSocket egress, IndexedDB, WebCrypto, Workers, and `__stubs__` for browser-incompatible dependencies. It cooperates with `@lararium/web` inside one Web-surface device/context assembly. That assembly remains a DreamNet peer across a real island boundary; browser inability to accept inbound sockets names a substrate constraint, not reduced authority. No React, no canvas.

`@lararium/web` carries Web-surface capability atoms: Vite, page DOM, worker URLs, admission carriers, web projection adapters, and an optional public `@oracle` read. Together with `@lararium/browser`, it composes the local Web device/context assembly; that peer can carry a Lararium stack when its persona and document-owning capabilities stand. Its origin may come from localhost, LAN, or a public host; static byte distribution supplies a projection capability and never an authority. Reserve `@lararium/app` for a later generic application-surface composition after materially different vessel surfaces prove a shared contract.

`@lararium/keyhive` carries the capability layer — a pre-alpha integration of `@keyhive/keyhive` WASM bindings. One Keyhive Doc = one bag (1:1). The access axis carries the four Keyhive-native verbs (`pull` / `read` / `edit` / `admin`). Cap-event home and γ-with-operator-α-mirror sync stay in design flux — touch with care.

`@lararium/mempalace` carries the session-memory integration — a local-only read leg over the pinned mempalace sidecar plus the declared `lar_*` writeback (the tensegrity that binds verbatim drawers to domain bearings). mempalace itself rides **behind a causal-island boundary** as a vendored substrate — the memory-library, accessed-not-loaded — never a citizen of the stack. See `packages/MEMPALACE-INTEGRATION.md` + `lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/api/mempalace-integration`.

`@lares/cli` carries the operator-facing surface: the `lares` binary, arg parsing, process spawn, the socket invoker, the harness-wiring on `wake`, and the verb family in `commands/`. The CLI carries no protocol logic and **no transport of its own beyond one socket** — every verb dispatches to `@lararium/node` handlers through the daemon's UDS verb-channel (`verb-call.runVerb` → `local-connector.invokeLocal` → `<dataDir>/lares.sock`); an absent socket raises `DaemonUnreachable`, never a fallback. WS lives at the daemon's relay, for genuine remote peers; the CLI holds no Automerge dependency at all.

<<~/ahu>>

<<~ ahu #spine>>

## Quine-Wiki Spine

Canon starts in `bags/` carriers. Package code materializes those carriers into records, projections, tiddlers, and receipts.

Primary flow:

```text
bags/ carriers (memetic-wikitext)
  -> @lararium/mesh parser/compiler/indexes/projection-registry
  -> LarTiddlerStore records  +  AutomergeDocStore composite
  -> MemeProvider projections
  -> @lararium/tw5 island-kernel → wiki + carrier children
  -> verb-vm dispatch (TW5-native nalu)
  -> operator surface (@lares/cli) | browser vessel (@lararium/browser) | node host (@lararium/node)
```

Reverse flow needs care:

```text
TW5 child edit
  -> wiki-sync / LarariumCrdtSyncAdaptor
  -> parent carrier reconstruction (memetic-parser + grammar-cache)
  -> bag CRDT record
  -> projection fan-out + ReactionGraph dispatch
```

Residency transitions travel through the ACTION verb surface (`ADD`, `COPY`, `MOVE`, `CLEAR`, `DROP`, `LOAD`) governed by the [Residency Model Epic](EPIC-RESIDENCY-MODEL.md). The `lares act` CLI carries the operator surface; no `promote` shim exists. Do not let live wiki edits write `bags/` directly — operators land bag content through ACTION verbs.

<<~/ahu>>

<<~ ahu #boot-sequence>>

## Boot Sequence — three causal moments

The Node-surface assembly treats build, init, and runtime as strictly separated authorship moments. Browser and Web assemblies carry corresponding founding and runtime paths under their own substrate capabilities. No moment reaches into another's authority.

```text
Build time    scripts/build-genesis-island.ts    content Tiga → genesis/island.bin (CID-verifiable)
Init time     lares vessel found  (was scripts/init-lararium.ts)    social Tiga + identity ceremony → genesis/social-bootstrap.json
Runtime       openNodeVessel  /  openBrowserVessel          finds docs, wires layers; never authors social state
```

`genesis/social-bootstrap.json` materializes as a TW5 plugin container tagged `$:/tags/LarariumBootstrap`. The `lararium-bootstrap-sync` startup module promotes the container after the syncer initializes, so the bundle syncs as one package and individual user overrides remain editable.

### Admin VM (landed)

Admin state lives in its own Automerge doc at `lar:///ha.ka.ba/bags/admin` (bag URI; aligned to the bag-tag rule in [lar-uri.md](../bags/lares/ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/lar-uri.md)). The logical room presents at `lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/rooms/admin` (room URI). Two URIs, one doc — the bag-as-doc invariant gives admin its own sync boundary. The admin VM hosts itself through `open-admin-vm` (node) and `open-browser-admin-vm` (browser); bag-mirror configs ride as `$:/tags/LarariumBagMirror` tiddlers inside admin.

Operator-private to one node, federated to the operator's own devices via `cap=admin` device delegations through `@lararium/keyhive`.

### Browser three-tier genesis (landed)

`browser-genesis` mirrors the node three-tier model (pinned / hot / cold) into IndexedDB. The browser vessel earns the same gates A/B/C as node and the `workerEa` admin gate sits in front of the admin VM.

### Projection registry

Projections register as kinds with `LarProjectionRegistry`. The node-scoped `disk-projector` kind lives in `@lararium/node`. Configs ride as admin-room tiddlers tagged `$:/tags/LarariumProjection`.

<<~/ahu>>

<<~ ahu #boundary-law>>

## Boundary Law

**Core MUST NOT import** TW5, React, filesystem APIs, DOM APIs, or Automerge runtime objects. `@lararium/mesh` stays neutral.

**Browser code SHOULD NOT** import Node-shaped disk paths. If `fs`, `path`, `vm`, or Node crypto enter a browser bundle, surface the shore. Use the `@lararium/browser/__stubs__` pattern for browser-incompatible deps.

**Namespace boundary.** `@lararium/*` = runtime stack (mesh, tw5, node, browser, web, keyhive, mempalace). `@lararium/app` remains reserved for a later generic application surface. `@lares/*` = operator-facing surface (cli). `@dreamdeck/*` = canvas layer (none active yet). Do not cross these on convenience.

**TW5 derived child tiddlers SHOULD** roundtrip through parent carriers without losing decorators, sigils, TOML, or sibling slots. Any fallback reconstruction counts as a ka spot until a test covers it.

**Session-local tiddlers stay local.** `$:/temp/*`, `Draft of *`, cursors, focus state, and private overlays MUST NOT reach shared room state.

**Capability layer is the only authority gate.** Do not invent ad-hoc auth checks; route through `@lararium/keyhive` or the `admin-auth-gate` in `@lararium/node`.

**Bag URI law.** Bag tags occupy `child[1]` only. Do not promote a `child[N]` sigil to bag identity. See [lar-uri.md](../bags/lares/ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/lar-uri.md).

<<~/ahu>>

<<~ ahu #test-routes>>

## Test Routes

Use the smallest receipt first.

Whole-workspace typecheck:

```sh
pnpm -r --filter './packages/**' typecheck
```

Focused package tests (only the four packages that ship vitest configs today):

```sh
pnpm --filter @lararium/mesh test
pnpm --filter @lararium/tw5 test
pnpm --filter @lararium/node test
pnpm --filter @lararium/browser test
```

`@lararium/keyhive` and `@lares/cli` carry no test scripts yet; typecheck covers them.

TW5 fixture and sigil-alignment routes:

```sh
pnpm test:tw5-fixture
pnpm test:sigil-alignment
pnpm test:tw5-flow         # placeholder — residency-action flow scripts pending
pnpm test:flows            # top-level integration flows
```

Build all package outputs when generated files, barrels, bundle shores, TW5 vendor assets, or web integration change:

```sh
pnpm -r --filter './packages/**' build
```

`@lararium/tw5` build is the heavy one (vendor + plugin-tiddler + tsc + sync-heleuma). Expect minutes per iteration.

If sandboxing blocks `tsx` IPC under `/tmp`, request escalation and rerun the same build command.

<<~/ahu>>

<<~ ahu #friction-watch>>

## Friction Watch

Watch these current weak spots:

* **Automerge v2.5.6 API law.** `repo.find()` rejects on unavailable; use the `allowableStates` pattern. `shutdown()` → `flush()`. The workspace pins `@automerge/automerge-repo` to `2.5.5` via overrides.
* **Keyhive pre-alpha.** `@keyhive/keyhive@0.0.0-alpha.58b` — WASM bindings move under us. Cap-event home and γ-with-operator-α-mirror sync stay in design flux.
* **Browser worker bridge.** The former frozen-bundle M3 fixture no longer measures the runtime; the current worker bridge resolves browser modules through the TW5 module table. Keep browser-worker changes covered by the live bridge and C4 controls rather than reviving a checked-in bundle.
* **`child[1]` bag URI law.** Sigils above `child[1]` MUST NOT carry bag tags. Treat any violation as a structural error.
* **`@lararium/tw5` barrel** can expose Node-shaped disk/TW5 boot imports to browser bundles. Audit barrel changes against the browser build.
* **Child-carrier reconstruction** produces lossy fallback paths when surgical slot replacement misses. Tests cover the happy paths; the fallback path lacks coverage.
* **Automerge `whenReady()` and true initial peer replay** completion may not mean the same thing.
* **Generated files** in `@lararium/tw5/src/generated-*` come from `scripts/`; do not hand-edit unless you intend to replace the generator output.
* **`pnpm-workspace.yaml` globs `packages/*`.** A directory added there without a `package.json` and source will surface install errors.
* **Open IDE tabs** may name stale files; trust filesystem scans over editor ghosts.
* **mempalace stays vendored.** Never edit the `mempalace/` submodule; it rides behind the causal-island boundary. Tune behavior through `~/.mempalace/config.json` (e.g. `hooks.auto_save=false`) and our `@lararium/mempalace` layer. Bumping the `lar_*` enrichment ⇒ bump `lar_hv` in lockstep (`harvest.ts buildPatch` ⟷ `drawer_io.py HARVEST_VERSION`). Run `lares sense pour --all` only on a **fresh** palace — re-staging existing drawers under a new `source_file` duplicates them.

<<~/ahu>>

<<~ ahu #edit-discipline>>

## Edit Discipline

Prefer one shore per loop. Patch the package that owns the behavior. Add or update a test near the owner package. Keep canon, room, user, and session layers distinct in names and code paths.

Before changing a public export, check browser and node consumers (and `@lares/cli`, which depends on both `@lararium/mesh` and `@lararium/node`). Before changing parser or carrier grammar, check `bags/lares/ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/`, `bags/lares/ha.ka.ba/lares/docs/pono/`, and core parser tests. Before changing TW5 sync, check echo-loop guards and draft guards.

Documentation memes go to `bags/` as `.md` files. `.tid` files live in TW5 packages and carry runtime widget / procedure code only.

When reporting back, use OODA-HA receipts: observe facts, orient boundary, decide shore, act summary, ho'oko commands, aftermath risks.
