# Lares Handoff — Active Work Only

> ⚠ **STALE — FROZE 2026-06-07. The standing procedures rest at `lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/working-procedures`, and the roadmap at `lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/docs/stable-founding-road`.** Everything below stops at the V3-peer-auth / S9-browser state and MISSES the entire arc that landed after: LOAD verb → mint gate → F-arc → hull watchdog → genesis-intake → the INGEST gesture + watcher (~30 commits through `e38bbd22`, 2026-06-13). Real suite state 2026-06-14: mesh 275✓ · tw5 113✓ · node 124✓ · browser 13✓ (the 4 ingest RED found this session were fixture drift — fixed same day).

## Current State — 2026-06-07 (read this first; older sections below are history)

**Green:** typecheck 6/6 · mesh 254 · tw5 73 · node 94 · browser 20. Run `pnpm test:fresh` (build-then-test) after source changes — cross-package tests import built dist, stale until rebuilt (V11 guard).

**Committed `7d727c77` (`lar:///verb.kupono.flows`) — the task surface matured from mechanism into LANGUAGE, and the residency-change ask flows end-to-end:**
- **Verb grammar (LANGUAGE-protocol frame):** internal register = **verb · summons · outcome** — a verb is *placed* locally or *summoned* to a peer; the island *heeds*; the dispatcher *dispatches*; it *concludes* in an outcome. Renames: summon · heedSummons · concludeVerb · buildVerb · parseVerb · placeVerb · dispatchVerb · `Verb` (was VerbInvocation; `.action` field, wire field "verb" retained) · OutcomeRecord · SUMMONS/OUTCOME_URI_PREFIX. signal→summons; effect log→**ledger**. UCAN task/receipt = boundary projection ONLY. Canon: `EPIC-TASK-ONTOLOGY.md`, `project_task_graph_geometry`.
- **Residency front door (the genuine ask = "change a meme's residency"):** `registerActionReactors` mounted into BOTH vessels' job/registry — `lares act` (ADD/COPY/MOVE/CLEAR/DROP/LOAD) now reaches the reactors (the vessel composite spans the bags; mutation → the ledger). **V1**: `lares act` content-addresses the idempotent change (`taskContentId`, empty nonce; change-id = idempotency key) → exactly-once EFFECT on re-issue.
- **Debt:** cut the dead main-side `_verifier` (V10); added `test:fresh` (V11).

**Uncommitted (atop `7d727c77`) — V3 peer-boundary auth, the PURE platform-blind halves:** `authProofBytes` (the gate-bound what-to-sign — binds nonce + GATE pubkey + peer pubkey + aud + ts; signing the nonce alone stays relayable) + `buildAuthResponse` (the signed `lar:auth`) + `runPeerHandshake(PeerHandshake)` (the platform-blind peer flow — a thin seam: inject recv/send/sign/contactCard; transport per platform, identity from the isomorphic keyhive). Named **gate ↔ peer** (no server/client). SCOUT FINDING: the peer handshake DID NOT EXIST (no mkLarAuth caller). REMAINING = each edge SOURCES the seam (node/browser/CLI: their WS + a keyhive/signer from the operator seed) + the gate sends gatePubKey in `lar:challenge` + verifies via the worker seam + the ENFORCEMENT FLIP. Canon: `project_verification_placement`.

**NEXT:** V3 edge composition — wire one edge (the node connector) → browser + CLI → gate gatePubKey+verify → flip enforcement. Gated on operator decisions: the **kind-noun fork** (internal house verb/outcome kinds vs UCAN — proposed resolve: internal=house, task/receipt=boundary; awaiting nod) blocks V2/V9; the **verb→capability policy table** (operator authors) blocks V7. Full ranked thread map: `project_next_vectors`.

**(CLOSED) the former burning ticket — delegated verbs ran UNVERIFIED:** resolved `4834c66d` (verify-then-delegate in the keyholder worker) + the dead main-side `_verifier` cut this session. The in-process hop = channel-as-capability; crypto only at the peer boundary (= V3).

## Current State — 2026-06-06 (history)

**Green:** typecheck 10/10 · mesh 236 · tw5 73 · node 94 · browser 20/20. **Dist-build VERIFIED 2026-06-06** — topo `pnpm -r build` clean; suites run against built artifacts, not only source aliases.

**Isomorphism-by-composition campaign: COMPLETE.** All 5 mirror pairs + further cuts landed (git `cd0122cc`…`cc3a9419`): island kernels (`runSovereignKernel`+`IslandHostSeam`), admin VMs (`openAdminVmCore`+`askIsland`), vessel-factory cascade (pair 3: `mountSocialPlane`/`addCanonLayer`/`seedVesselDefaults`/`mountPrimaryWiki`), pool (`VesselIslandPoolCore`; browser inherits residency), admin entry (`makeOperatorAdminBehavior`), wiki behavior (`makeWikiBehavior`). Both vessels read as thin host seams over shared cores; divergence lives only in held capability + recipe DATA + the 4 platform×capability spawn entries (the floor). Canon: `feedback_isomorphism_by_composition`.

**This session (post-campaign, 2026-06-06):** `bcb3a912` oracle-resolution protocol — `resolveOracleDoc` in mesh collapses 4 hand-copied catalog-oracle sites (wiki+draft × node+browser) to one; `wiki-recipe` `LARARIUM_BAG`/`LARES_BAG` single-sourced from the derived `lar-uris` consts (triple-alias drift eliminated); YIN comment pass — fixed `promote`-as-live-rite lying comments, stripped dated retirement tombstones, removed the deleted-`carrier-split.ts` reference.

**Earlier this run (pre-pairs collapse, newest first):**
- `8c975f2a` / `aa582f4a` — **YIN cuts**: deleted `vessel-platform.ts` (vestigial home for the rejected `VesselPlatform` DI interface — `AuthVerifierSeam` moved to `island-protocol.ts`), `browser-dock.ts` (misnomer — `WikiMountSpec` moved to `wiki-recipe.ts`, dead `BrowserProjectionSnapshot` removed), dead `mountPrimaryWorker` alias, orphan tombstone comments.
- `cc24f3b9` — **one isomorphic `mountWiki(id, WikiMountSpec)`** both pools take. `WikiBootContext` retired; the CALLER builds the full resolver on both platforms; disk-write rides as the node pool's **held** `diskMirrorGrant`; `recipe.mirrorBags` is the **synced** designation; the island mirrors iff designation ∩ grant.
- `c5253b9b` — **shared verb→event conformance spec** (`@lararium/mesh`) that BOTH node (real-TW5 `m3-breathing`) and browser (`browser-verb-breathing` fixture) run — isomorphism proven by *doing*.
- `77389c01` — headless TW5 boot composed: two `load*TiddlyWiki` → one `loadTiddlyWikiFromBlob` + emergent `HeadlessBootEnv`. `29813d4f` — `global ??= globalThis` env-contract fix (TW5 in a browser Worker = a synthetic THIRD runtime).
- `65d82084` (E.5 node) + `b5e87384` (E.6 browser) — **keyhive moved host→worker** on both vessels (Stage 1 activation). Sovereignty-follows-canon: keyhive boots in the admin worker's `onEa`, which only spins up with a core; a coreless vessel is pre-sovereign; TW5 loads in all cases (anon → UI state, not a boot abort).

**The governing discipline (canon — see `feedback_isomorphism_by_composition` memory):** web3 COMPOSITION is pono, web2 INTERFACE thinking is un-pono. Keep ONE signature; push divergence into DATA (synced recipe) + held CAPABILITIES (relay/leaf, disk-write are grants you hold, not platform facts); derive each seam BOTTOM-UP by subtraction (a prior top-down `VesselPlatform` got contradicted — that's why it just died); proof = behavioral conformance, not type-conformance.

**NEXT — burning ticket: delegated verbs run UNVERIFIED.** `mountMainVerbs(registry, verifier?)` (`tw5/admin-vm-core.ts`) takes an OPTIONAL verifier; both vessels call it with none (`open-node-vessel.ts:544`, `open-browser-vessel.ts:462`), so the `admin:delegate-verb` path runs `runLocalVerb` with no `_verifier` → host-delegated verbs (where/resolve/residency/add-bag/…) execute WITHOUT capability verification. This breaches the local-verifiability wall (the load-bearing protocol invariant: never trust a claim you can't verify locally). **DESIGN FORK (operator's call before fixing):** (A) wire `adminVm.authSeam.verify` as the verifier into `mountMainVerbs` — main calls back to the worker's keyhive per verb (round-trip); or (B) verify in the worker's `delegate-verb` dispatch BEFORE posting to main — verify where the keys are; main runs pre-verified. B reads cleaner. = ROADMAP Priority 1 "Stage 1b". Origin: the Stage-1 keyhive host→worker move (`65d82084`/`b5e87384`) left the main-thread verb registry without its verifier.

**Floor (divergence that STAYS — composition by capability, not collapse):** the 4 platform×capability worker entry scripts; genesis bootstrap tiers; node WS relay office + verb-registry powers; disk-projector fs impl. Metric = duplication removed, not files deleted. The 5-pair collapse campaign is DONE — do not reopen it.

**Open / downstream (not this campaign):** relay-access RINGS epic (`project_relay_access_rings` — anon-read is gate POLICY not a keyhive grant; tiered sharePolicy); SES/Compartment realm gate BEFORE unpinned code (mesh bags / user macros) enters the island realm (`project_headless_island_runtime`); the full keyhive-synced disk token (local fs-grant suffices today); S7.7 @personal cross-device.

**Asymmetric-peer task-handoff (model: `project_asymmetric_peer_handoff`).** Keystone landed (`lar:///verb.replayed.dedups` — durable verb idempotency, the CRDT as dedup store). Design space written for the two surfaced gaps: cross-peer handoff → `bags/lares/api/pono/federated-causal-islands.md#task-handoff`; personGroup-liveness pre-delegation → `bags/lares/api/lararium/personal-slot.md#persongroup-liveness`. Still open: lease + fencing token for concurrent cross-vessel double-run (lives with the residency-model design).

**Key memories:** `feedback_isomorphism_by_composition`, `project_isomorphic_vessel_epic`, `project_headless_island_runtime`, `project_relay_access_rings`.

3. Path K / F-arc: IslandAdaptor.saveTiddler debounce + projection auto-truncate.
4. Path R: ReactionEngine completion — onChangeset wiring, changed-URI derivation,
   NodeVmManager integration tests through mount→event→forward→unmount cycle.

Automerge API law (confirmed, v2.5.6): always pass { allowableStates: ["ready",
"unavailable"] } to repo.find() when a missing doc should gracefully fall back.
repo.find() is async and rejects on "unavailable" by default. handle.isUnavailable()
checks the settled state. repo.shutdown() calls repo.flush() — sequential test
ordering plus await shutdown() guarantees IDB durability. Stay on v2.5.6: main
branch is v2.6.0-alpha.0 (10 days old as of 2026-05-29), xstate→DocumentQuery
refactor in flight, Keyhive not integrated, no stable release date.

Path G.SharktoothSigil: COMPLETE. 65 sigil tiddlers; zero active [[sigils]] TOML blocks.
Remaining TOML in memetic-wikitext.tid: documentation data tables only (Path O).

Rules: TW5 VM primacy; vessel = lararium identity+runtime unit (not "peer");
bag = Automerge-doc = sync-boundary; ea = sovereignty breath (not "heartbeat");
no HTTP/RPC coordination surface; explicit operator promotion for canon.
Web3 only — no web2 models/code/flows in Lares stack.
gen_island pattern: runSovereignWorker = kernel; IslandBehavior = callback module;
onEa/onSignal/onDemote = OTP init/1 / handle_info/2 / terminate/2.
VesselIslandPool: vessel invites islands (mounts), does not supervise them.

## What Changed This Turn (2026-05-31 turn 32)

### Residency Model — Sprints 2/3/3-deferred/4 + `lares promote` retirement cleanup ✅ workspace 369→? (+33 from Sprint 4) · ceremony fully retired

**Sprints landed in one continuous arc (turns 31→32):**

- **Sprint 2** — ACTION verb data model. `residency-actions.ts` (~210 lines) carries `ACTION_VERBS` const tuple (`ADD`/`COPY`/`MOVE`/`CLEAR`/`DROP`/`LOAD`), `ResidencyAction` discriminated union (6 variants), `parseResidencyAction` validator, `newChangeId` factory, change-id preservation across encode→JSON→parse roundtrip (Anti-pattern #1 defense). 50 tests. URI grammar resolved: ACTION verbs compose on top of `verb-tiddler.ts` (M.2 pipeline) — no new URI prefix invented. Commit `8265b216`.
- **Sprint 3** — Multi-residency at recipe layer. `CompositeStore.resolveAll(title)` + `resolveTopmost(title)` + `WikiRecipe.bagEpochs` + `WikiRecipe.lenses` + `lensFor()` hook. Nalu engine annotates inbound writes with `origin-bag` field (Anti-pattern #4 defense). `getOriginBag(wiki, title)` helper in `@lararium/tw5`. 21 tests.
- **Sprint 3 deferred-enactment** — `headsEqual()` set-semantic helper, `LarTiddlerStore.getHeads?()` + `AutomergeDocStore.getHeads()`, `CompositeStore.auditEpochs(recipe)`, `EpochPinState` discriminated union. Lens registry reworked from per-bag (`SlotUri`) to per-version (`schemaVersion` string) per Cambria research finding. `LarTiddlerMeta.schemaVersion?` added. Three research spirits dispatched (Automerge heads, Cambria lenses, production CRDT pinning) — all refined the design. 19 tests.
- **Sprint 4** — Effect record surface (archival audit). `effect-record.ts` (~280 lines) carries `ARCHIVAL_VERBS` const (`accession`, `deaccession`, `transfer`, `withdrawal`, `loan`, `holdings`, `reappraisal`, `disposition`), `EffectRecord` interface, `mapActionToEffects()` per-verb mapping, `writeEffectRecord()` + `withEffectRecord()` helpers. Whiteout-shadow semantics in `resolveTopmost`/`getLive` (Anti-pattern #3 defense): tombstone in higher bag stops cascade rather than falling through. New `listBagsTombstoning(title)` surfaces hides. 33 tests.
- **Talk-Story conflict-surfacing principle** captured as canon. Operator named the architectural truth: CRDT layer detects + records conflicts; resolution surfaces to operator-agent or cabal Talk Story. Automated arbitration reads as anti-pono. `residency-model.md` gains `#conflict-resolution` ahu; deferred items (modal-view reader + commit queue) reframed from "arbitration mechanisms" to "Talk-Story-surfacing layers." `project-talk-story-conflict-surfacing` memory saved.

**`lares promote` retirement (Aftermath cleanup loop):**

Operator directive: retire the ceremony completely; no un-pono language; no deprecation shim. Executed in five waves:

- **Wave A (code):** Deleted `lares-cli/src/commands/promote.ts`, `lararium-node/src/promote-handler.ts`, `lararium-tw5/src/modules/lar-promote.ts`, `lararium-tw5/tiddlers/src/lar-promote.js`. Updated `bin/lares.ts` (removed cmdPromote + verb row), `island-behaviors.ts` (removed `_registry.register("promote", ...)`), `lararium-node/src/index.ts` + `lararium-tw5/src/index.ts` (removed exports), `open-node-vessel.ts` (removed orphaned `jobRegistry.register("promote", ...)` + scrubbed 4 ceremony comments), `commands/draft.ts` + `commands/wiki.ts` (scrubbed user-facing strings).
- **Wave B (tests):** Deleted `tests/lararium-tw5/promote/` directory and `tests/lararium-tw5/sync/sync-decompose-promote.sh`. Updated `tests/lararium-tw5/vitest.config.ts` include path → `residency/**`. Rewrote `tests/bin/run-flow.sh` (removed `tw5-decompose` + `tw5-promote` subcommands). Updated `packages/lararium-node/tests/bag-paths.test.ts` (replaced lar-promote test-data URI with `nalu-engine`). Updated root `package.json` `test:tw5-flow` to a placeholder script.
- **Wave C (memes):** Deleted `bags/lararium/node/promote-handler.md` + `bags/lararium/tw5/modules/lar-promote.md`. Scrubbed ceremony references in `bags/lares/api/pono/lar-uri.md`, `bags/lares/docs/lares/the-lares-protocols.md`, `bags/lares/docs/lares/the-lararium-hud.md`, `bags/lararium/node/handler-args.md`, `bags/lararium/tw5/tw5-fields-flat.md`.
- **Wave D (planning):** Updated `packages/AGENTS.md` (removed promote-handler from @lararium/node listing; removed `promote` from @lares/cli verb list; rewrote Canon promotion paragraph). Updated `packages/ROADMAP.md` (test-flow description). Rewrote `packages/TALK-STORY-NEXT.md` rules (removed deprecation-shim line, added conflict-surfacing principle). Rewrote `packages/EPIC-RESIDENCY-MODEL.md` Sprint 5 (removed S5.3 deprecation-shim story; added S5.6 `promotion-ceremony.ts` retirement as named follow-up). Updated `tests/AGENTS.md` + `tests/README.md`.
- **Wave E (verify):** Workspace typecheck clean across 6 packages.

**Named pono-debt surfaced (not closed in this turn):**

- `promotion-ceremony.ts` + `PROMOTION_RECEIPT_TAG` constant in `@lararium/mesh` — deep architectural surface that `causal-island.ts` references; retirement deferred to Sprint 5 (story S5.6).
- ~~`ABILITY_LADDER` in `causal-island.ts` includes `"promote"`~~ — RESOLVED 2026-06-01. The ladder collapsed to the 4 Keyhive-native verbs (`pull`/`read`/`edit`/`admin`); `promote`+`propose` (2026-05-31) and `sync`+`revoke` (2026-06-01) retired. The ladder is now Axis 1 (ACCESS) of the 3-axis authority model; see `lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/causal-islands` + `alignment-layer`.
- Worker tier-signal types in `the-lararium-hud.md` (line 454) still use `"promote"|"demote"` strings — describes a P.3 surface that hasn't fully landed; will harmonize with the ACTION verb register when Worker #1 ships.

**Metrics:** mesh 213/213 (+33 from Sprint 4), tw5 73/73, node 64/64, browser 19/20 (1 pre-existing TW5-boot shim gap). Workspace 369/370. Typecheck 6/6 packages clean. Branch carries ~50 modified files across the four-sprint arc + cleanup; commit boundary remains operator's call.

## What Changed This Turn (2026-05-30 turn 31)

### Residency Model Epic — pono memetic intent + sprint plan landed ✅ docs+memes only, no code

**Architectural decision approved.** After two rounds of research (eight spirits total), the recipe/bag + CRDT model resolves as a **coordinate space + query plan**, not a timeline + branches. The git-style `stage / commit / push` triple proposed in the prior pivot gets retired — it imported a timeline mental model into a coordinate-space architecture. The actual surface carries **two distinct verb registers**:

- **ACTION verbs (lar URIs, ALL CAPS, SPARQL Update derivation):** `ADD`, `COPY`, `MOVE`, `CLEAR`, `DROP`, `LOAD` — operator gestures over residency.
- **Effect-record annotations (tiddler tags, archival profession derivation):** `accession`, `deaccession`, `transfer`, `withdrawal`, `loan`, `holdings`, `reappraisal`, `disposition` — indelible audit per residency change.

Floating Librarians of Mu endorse (high confidence). Pono.

**Memetic intent landed:** [`bags/lares/api/lararium/residency-model.md`](../bags/lares/api/lararium/residency-model.md) (confidence 17, status=approved, approved-on 2026-05-30). Carries the load-bearing invariant: coordinate-first not timeline-first; Work-identity preserved across residencies (FRBR/LRM); operator-visible coordinate surface; audit-trail discipline; verb vocabulary from set-algebra + cataloging. Six named anti-patterns surfaced from research (causal-history severance, schema drift, whiteout resurrection, shadow-override confusion, recipe-drift poisoning, concurrent commits) — each gets a named defense in the sprint plan.

**Sprint plan authored:** [`packages/EPIC-RESIDENCY-MODEL.md`](EPIC-RESIDENCY-MODEL.md) — ten sprints in OODA-HA cycle-flow form. Sprint 1 (memetic intent + reconciliation) closed this turn. Sprints 2–10 queued: data model + URI grammar, multi-residency at recipe layer, effect-record audit, action handlers in node + CLI, browser parity, `@personal` slot enactment coordinated with the model, coordinate-inspection UI, doc meme sweep, test golden regeneration.

**Reconciliation:** [`personal-slot.md`](../bags/lares/api/lararium/personal-slot.md) (status remains `approved`) gains a `#reconciliation` ahu block clarifying that cascade rules become **first-write defaults** under the residency model, with +2 multi-bag residency tests added to the migration plan. Coordinated with Sprint 7 of the new Epic.

**Memory:** `project_residency_model_architecture.md` saved. Prior memory `project_stage_commit_push_model.md` marked SUPERSEDED with header warning; preserved for context.

**Cross-references updated:**
- `packages/ROADMAP.md` — Priority 2 row added (Residency Model Epic); Path N description updated to reflect `<$lar-action>` widget shape instead of `<$lar-promote>`.
- `packages/TALK-STORY-NEXT.md` — rules section now names ACTION verbs + archival audit as the canonical surface; `lares promote` named as deprecation shim for one milestone.

**Research synthesis (eight spirits across two sessions):** Round 1 surveyed CRDT composition, git/jj/pijul/cherry-pick, overlay/union filesystem anti-patterns, multi-vault knowledge tool UX. Round 2 stripped git framing entirely and surveyed CRDT residency primitives, library/archival cataloging vocabulary, federation/propagation protocols, scope/namespace patterns. The convergent finding across both rounds: **no shipping CRDT system has composed multi-bag residency with operator-facing gestures.** SDM fills a real gap. Closest validators: TiddlyWiki Bags/Recipes (same shape, K/V not CRDT), RDF named graphs + SPARQL Update (settled vocabulary since 2013), FRBR/LRM + SAA professional discipline (identity-across-custody, late 19th c.), Willow protocol (CRDT-adjacent substrate that separates coordinate from payload by design). Key citations preserved in `residency-model.md` `#closest-prior-art`.

**Code surface untouched.** 72 lingering `promote` references across `lares-cli`, `lararium-node`, `lararium-mesh` await Sprint 5 of the Epic. `promote-handler.ts` stays in place. Tests stay green. Branch carries no new code commits.

**Metrics:** unchanged from turn 30 — mesh 96/96, tw5 67/67, node 64/64, browser 19/20 (1 pre-existing TW5-boot shim gap).

### TW5-native unified-nalu + WikiRecipe one-model + in-wiki bag-paths cascade ✅ 227/227 tests (browser m3 pre-existing shim gap)

Three connected architectural moves landed across mesh, tw5, node, browser:

**1. TW5-native unified nalu (yin-collapse law in code).**
The wiki IS the reactive engine. New `module-type: startup` plugin module
[`nalu-engine.ts`](lararium-tw5/src/modules/nalu-engine.ts) owns the

from `isIslandToVesselMsg`, ProjectionStore type alias. Prior-art research
(DriftWatch worker spirit): Vue 3 scheduler · MobX `transaction` · Yjs `transact`
· Solid `batch` · React 18 auto-batch · S.js · DREAM glitch-freedom — all
converge on one-tick-boundary across heterogeneous sources.

**2. WikiRecipe — one model for every wiki.**
```typescript
interface WikiRecipe { wikiSlug: string; canonBags?: readonly SlotUri[] }
```
Expands to fixed cascade `[@temp, @draft, @<wikiSlug>, ...canon, @lares, @lararium]`.
Slot URIs live in the `lar:///ha.ka.ba/bags/<name>` namespace alongside content
URIs (no parallel naming system). Manifest carries `recipe: WikiRecipe +
resolver: { slotUri → AutomergeUrl }` instead of `bagBindings[]`. `BagBinding`
type retired; `BAG_IDS.scratch/projection/draft` deleted (slot URIs replace them).
`ADMIN_BAG_ID` aligned to `lar:///ha.ka.ba/bags/admin` (was nested under @lararium).
`IslandBehavior.writeBagId` retired — admin/wiki behaviors share recipe shape;
differences live in `onEa` / `onSignal`.

**3. In-wiki bag-paths cascade (TW5 cascade pattern).**
Write routing moves OUT of TS prefix-matching into the wiki itself. Default
cascade ships as plugin tiddler `lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/config/bag-paths`:

```
[prefix[$:/temp/]then[lar:///ha.ka.ba/bags/temp]]
[prefix[Draft of ]then[lar:///ha.ka.ba/bags/draft]]
[prefix[$:/]then[]]
[prefix[lar:]then{lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/config/current-wiki-bag}]
```

`IslandAdaptor._routeBag()` walks this cascade via `wiki.filterTiddlers(filter,
undefined, source)` — first non-empty result wins, empty string = explicit
skip. Per-wiki current-wiki-bag value lives in `@temp` (volatile, set by
`buildIslandRecipe`). Mirrors TW5's `$:/config/FileSystemPaths` pattern
(filesystem.js:317). Pono properties: routing logic lives as data,
operator-configurable at runtime, per-wiki overlays compose via cascade
priority (wiki bag overrides @lararium default automatically).

**Shadow-tiddler semantics confirmed.** `CompositeStore.put({bag})` writes one
layer only — multi-bag occupancy by design. Stage/commit mental model maps
cleanly: edits stage to @<wiki>, explicit `bag` field commits to canon
(@lares for federation, others local). `tombstoneInBag(bagId, title)` exists
for explicit per-bag delete (publish semantics).

**Cleanup pass:** stale comment sweep across docstrings (sovereign-island-model,
island-context, island-behaviors, lar-admin-island, lar-wiki-island,
browser-sovereign-island-model, browser-wiki-worker, memory-store, tw5-vm,
island-protocol header). 4 `$:/config/Lar*` literal refs migrated to
`lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/config/*` namespace. Memes: deleted
`bags/lares/api/lararium/island-accumulator.md` (class retired),
rewrote [island-adaptor.md](../bags/lares/api/lararium/island-adaptor.md),
updated [nalu.md](../bags/lares/api/pono/nalu.md), wrote new
[nalu-engine.md](../bags/lares/api/lararium/nalu-engine.md).

**Surfaced but not enacted (sibling sprints):**
- Legacy `lar:///config/Lar/*` cascade-template URIs (36 refs across wikitext
  template tiddlers) — analogous pono concern, separate sweep.
- TW5 UX surface: bag-data tab in tiddler info, CRDT metadata, history crumbs,
  stage/commit UI controls, bulk commit verb, federation-vs-local bag
  annotations on @lares / @lararium.
- Browser TW5-boot global-shim gap (pre-existing, surfaces only when
  browser-m3-breathing fixture exists) — separate diagnostic story.
- `promote` → `commit` verb rename (operator's "stage/commit" mental model).

**Metrics:** mesh 96/96, tw5 67/67, node 64/64, browser 19/20 (1 pre-existing
TW5-boot shim issue, unrelated to this work). Multiple commits ahead.

## What Changed This Turn (2026-05-29 turn 29)

### Automerge `repo.find()` guard — three call sites hardened ✅ 248/248 tests

**Research synthesis (three agents: disk source, Ink & Switch GitHub, Brooklyn Zelenka/Fission):**

Confirmed that `waitHandleLocal` (and two sibling sites) had a misplaced try/catch:
`repo.find()` is `async` in v2.5.6 and **rejects** with `Error("Document X is unavailable")`
when a doc reaches the "unavailable" state. The try/catch only wrapped the subsequent
`handle.whenReady()` call, which was unreachable if `repo.find()` threw. The `handle.on("error", () => {})` added in the prior turn was dead code — `DocHandle` uses **eventemitter3** (not Node.js native EventEmitter), emits no "error" event, and eventemitter3 does not throw for unhandled event names.

**Blessed v2.5.6 pattern** (confirmed from Repo.d.ts, Repo.js dist):
```typescript
// CORRECT — repo.find() resolves with handle regardless of state;
// caller routes to fallback() on unavailable.
try {
  const handle = await repo.find<T>(url, { allowableStates: ["ready", "unavailable"] });
  if (handle.isUnavailable()) return fallback();
  return handle;
} catch {
  return fallback();  // storage adapter error, corrupted doc, etc.
}
```

**Three sites fixed:**
- `packages/lararium-browser/src/open-browser-vessel.ts` — `waitHandleLocal` (5 call sites in vessel boot)
- `packages/lararium-browser/src/browser-genesis.ts` — `findGenesisIsland` (had outer catch that saved it but with dead `whenReady` + `state` check)
- `packages/lararium-browser/src/open-browser-admin-vm.ts` — admin handle load (misplaced inner try)

**Key facts confirmed from source:**
- `repo.shutdown()` calls `repo.flush()` (Repo.js:740-744). `await repo.shutdown()` guarantees IDB writes land. The sequential test ordering (`await a.repo.shutdown()` before opening b) is the correct and sufficient durability fence — no separate `repo.flush()` call needed before shutdown.
- `handle.whenReady(["ready", "unavailable"])` still works in published v2.5.6 but is deprecated in the unreleased main branch. Migration: `allowableStates` option on `repo.find()`.
- `handle.isUnavailable()` still works in published v2.5.6 (`isUnavailable = () => this.inState(["unavailable"])`).

**Automerge main-branch decision: STAY ON v2.5.6.**
v2.6.0-alpha.0 released 2026-05-19 (10 days old). xstate→DocumentQuery architectural refactor in flight, 38 open PRs, two known bugs (#462 FS cache, #652 presence sync). Keyhive is not integrated into automerge-repo at all. No stable release date. The `allowableStates` API we now use maps cleanly to the v2.6 `findWithProgress().subscribe()` API — migration will be mechanical when stable releases.

**Brooklyn Zelenka / Fission error taxonomy (6 patterns for reference):**
1. Unavailable = partition state, not error. Design for it as normal operating state.
2. Authorization ≠ Unavailability. Separate code paths; proof-CID-unresolvable is retry-candidate, capability-denied is not.
3. Causal buffering over error. "Not yet arrived" is a buffer state (p2panda). Operations with unmet causal deps are buffered, not rejected.
4. Monotonic queries tolerate partial data. RhizomeDB/Datalog: monotone queries return smaller-but-correct answers on partial data; no "unavailable" error.
5. Eventual revocation. Keyhive: revocation is a CRDT operation that propagates eventually; offline peers stay authorized locally until sync.
6. CAR Mirror session-scoped unavailability. Mark "unavailable from server X for this session," exclude from future rounds, try other servers. Not permanent.

**Commit:** `1c774f12` fix(browser): correct repo.find() unavailable guard across three call sites

**Metrics:** 248/248 tests pass (mesh 96, tw5 69, node 64, browser 19). 2 commits ahead of origin.

### M.3 — Full-TW5-Boot Reaction Gate ✅ 248/248 tests

**Gate closed:** `verb-tiddler-dispatch.test.ts` (2 tests) proves the full path:
CRDT write → island TW5 → `reaction-router` nalu fires → `tm-verse-event` →
`IslandMsg_Event` with `payload.verb === "MOVE"` arrives at vessel `onWorkerEvent`.

**Root cause (confirmed via TW5 boot.js trace):**
`reaction-router.ts` and `grammar-cache.ts` read `globalThis.$tw?.wiki` in their
`getWiki()` helpers. TW5's non-browser module evaluation path uses:
```
vm.runInContext(code, vm.createContext({}), filename)
```
Inside that `vm.runInContext({})` sandbox, `globalThis` resolves to the **empty VM
context object** — not the real Node.js globalThis. `$tw` is only reachable as the
**direct function parameter** injected by `evalGlobal`'s wrapper:
```javascript
(function($tw, module, exports, ...) { [module code] })($tw_value, ...)
```

**Fix:** Removed `getWiki()` from both modules. Added TypeScript ambient declaration:
```typescript
declare const $tw: { wiki?: TwWiki } | undefined;
```
All `getWiki()` call sites replaced with `$tw?.wiki` direct access.

**Files changed:**
- `packages/lararium-tw5/src/modules/reaction-router.ts` — `getWiki()` removed; `declare const $tw` ambient; `startup()` uses `$tw?.wiki` directly.
- `packages/lararium-tw5/src/grammar-cache.ts` — same pattern; `startup()` + `getGrammar()` both converted.
- `packages/lararium-node/src/sovereign-island-model.ts` — pono diagnostic block removed (§6c trace + drain log); clean.
- `packages/lararium-node/genesis/island.bin` — rebuilt (sha256=a3b9265a…, 508 KB, 4 blobs, 14 tiddlers).

**Architecture invariant confirmed:** Island Sovereignty Law holds end-to-end.
Plugin bytes travel from genesis `@lararium` Automerge doc blob store → island
`pluginTiddlers` → TW5 `preloadTiddlers` → `reaction-router` startup module runs
in TW5's `vm.runInContext` sandbox — no manifest byte transfer, no duplicate load path.

**Metrics:** 248/248 tests pass (mesh 96, tw5 69, node 64, browser 19). Build clean.

## What Changed This Turn (2026-05-28 turn 27)

### M.2 — verb-as-tiddler-field + routing pipeline closure ✅ 246/246 tests

**Architectural decision (adversarial-reviewed):**
URI carries minimum semantic identity only (`@admin/signals/<requestId>`).
Verb routing metadata lives entirely in tiddler fields — TW5-queryable,
filterable, cascadable. `[field:verb[MOVE]]` spans signal + outcome tiddlers.
Rating vs alternatives: Plan C (17/20) > Plan B URI-encodes-verb (11/20) > Plan A thread-scalar (12/20).

**`verb-tiddler.ts` (`@lararium/mesh`) — field model extended:**
- `VerbInvocation` gains optional `fromUri?` and `listenable?` fields (source device URI + Verse event name)
- `buildVerbInvocation` / `buildVerbSignal` write `"from-uri"` and `"listenable"` tiddler fields
- `parseVerbInvocation` reads them back (exactOptionalPropertyTypes-safe spread pattern)
- `buildVerbOutcome` already carried `verb` field — no change needed

**`island-protocol.ts` (`@lararium/mesh`) — protocol extended:**
- `AdminMsg_PlaceVerb` gains optional `fromUri?` and `listenable?`
- `mkAdminPlaceVerb` threads both fields through

**`reaction-router.ts` (`@lararium/tw5` TW5 startup module) — verb metadata extraction:**
- `parseEdgesForUri()` replaces `bindingsFromUri()` — single pass over `parseMemeEdges` output
  produces both `ReactionBinding[]` AND `Map<listenable, verb>` from `reaction:listenable` edges
- Module-level `_verbsByUri: Map<uri, Map<listenable, verb>>` — maintained in sync with nalu updates
- `fireReactionsForUri()` collects listenables from BOTH graph.bindings AND `_verbsByUri`
  (fires verb dispatch for tiddlers with `payload.verb` even without papalohe wires)
- `tm-verse-event` now carries `{ uri, listenable, verb?, fromUri? }` — backward compatible

**`tw5-vm.ts` — `onVerseEvent` signature extended:**
- `handleVerseEvent(uri, listenable, verb?, fromUri?)` — passes verb metadata through

**`island-kernel.ts` — `IslandMsg_Event.payload` enriched:**
- `payload: { uri, verb?, fromUri? }` — vessel sees all fields; observation-only events omit verb

**`admin-behavior.ts` — `admin:place-verb` handler threads `fromUri`/`listenable`** through to `placeVerbInvocation`

**Vessel wires — node + browser updated:**
- `open-node-vessel.ts` M.1 subscriber passes `listenable` + `fromUri?` to `placeVerb`
- `open-browser-vessel.ts` same; `BrowserVerbPlacementRequest` gains `fromUri?`/`listenable?`
- `open-browser-admin-vm.ts` threads both through `mkAdminPlaceVerb`

**`verb-signal.ts` — relay threads `fromUri`/`listenable`** from signal tiddler through to `placeVerb`

**Integration test — `tests/event-routing.test.ts` (new, 3 tests):**
- `tests/fixtures/event-verb-echo.mjs` — fixture island posts `IslandMsg_Event` with
  `{ verb: "echo-verb", listenable: "OnActivated", fromUri: "lar:///test/instances/move-button-1" }`
- Suite A: VesselIslandPool integration — asserts `payload.verb`, `payload.fromUri` arrive correctly
- Suite B: M.1 handler unit — extracts verb+fromUri+listenable, calls placeVerb; ignores observation-only

**Corpus — `bags/lararium/tw5/devices/move-button.md` (new):**
- First kumu device type meme with `reaction:listenable` edge carrying `payload.verb = "MOVE"`
- Documents the full dispatch chain from tiddler edge → verb dispatch → TW5 filter queries

## What Changed This Turn (2026-05-28 turn 26)

### ReactionGraph rename + M.1 wires + test coverage sprint

**`live-protocol.ts` → `reaction-graph.ts` (rename, `@lararium/mesh`):**
- Header comment rewritten to scope boundary claim: within-island dispatch only.
- Cross-island routing (`IslandMsg_Event`) and cross-vessel routing (CRDT convergence)
  explicitly named as out-of-scope.
- `production dispatch path` doc block added — `fireSync` is test-only; production
  calls `wiki.dispatchEvent("tm-verse-event")`.
- `packages/lararium-mesh/package.json` exports entry: `./reaction-graph` (was `./live-protocol`).
- `packages/lararium-mesh/src/index.ts` re-export updated.
- All importers updated: `reaction-router.ts`, `open-node-vessel.ts`, `open-browser-vessel.ts`,
  both vitest configs. No `live-protocol` import survives in source.

**`kumu-device.ts` header rewritten:** DEB editor wire → papalohe pranala edge framing;
`ReactionEngine` reference removed (ReactionEngine class deleted in yin-collapse sprint).

**`open-node-vessel.ts` — Path M.1 node wire:**
- `eventBus.subscribe("worker.event")` consumer wired *after* `await adminVm.workerEa`.
- `payload["verb"]` present → `adminVm.placeVerb({ verb, args, requestedBy })`.
- `payload["verb"]` absent → observation-only (signal drops cleanly, no error).
- Promise-pipelining law enforced: fire-and-forget, no ACK expected.

**`open-browser-vessel.ts` — Path M.1 browser wire:**
- `onWorkerEvent` stub replaced with real routing: `payload["verb"]` → `admin.placeVerb()`.
- Guard: `if (!verb || !admin) return` — admin-not-yet-live path clean.

**`@lararium/mesh` build:** `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json` emits `dist/reaction-graph.{js,d.ts}`.
`dist/live-protocol.*` artifacts removed.

**`@lararium/tw5` plugin rebuild:** `pnpm --filter @lararium/tw5 build` — plugin bundle
now references `reaction-graph` (not `live-protocol`). 121 inner tiddlers packed. 19 modules.

**`packages/lararium-mesh/tests/reaction-graph.test.ts` — 26 new tests:**
- `extractReactionBindings`: 5 tests (valid extraction, missing fields, empty strings, no endpoints, mixed list).
- `ReactionGraph` binding management: 4 tests (load replaces, updateUri partial replace, removeUri by fromUri, removeUri by toUri).
- Direct subscribe/fireSync: 5 tests (fires, wrong listenable skips, cancel, multiple handlers, default payload).
- `subscribeByFn`: 3 tests (fires for matching fn, wildcard once per fireSync, cancel).
- `onFireSync` observer: 3 tests (order before handlers, cancel, error isolation).
- `subscribeOnce`: 2 tests (resolves first payload only, pending on wrong listenable).
- Update invariant: 3 tests (handlers survive load() if key present, subscribeOnce survives updateUri(), error isolation between handlers).

**`bags/lararium/mesh/reaction-protocol.md`:** `source-file` already set to
`packages/lararium-mesh/src/reaction-graph.ts` — no edit needed. Meme coherent.

**Design note — M.1 payload.verb gap:** The `onWorkerEvent` → `placeVerb` route only
fires when `IslandMsg_Event.payload["verb"]` carries a string. The island-kernel currently
posts `payload: { uri }` — no `verb` field. So all current reaction events remain
observation-only at the vessel boundary. The next M sprint: author a wiki device tiddler
that fires a reaction with explicit `verb` in payload, and write an integration test that
proves the full round-trip.

**Files changed:** `reaction-graph.ts` (rename + header), `kumu-device.ts`, `index.ts`,
`open-node-vessel.ts`, `open-browser-vessel.ts`, two vitest configs,
`reaction-graph.test.ts` (new), `package.json` (@lararium/mesh exports).

**Metrics:** 243/243 tests pass (mesh 96, tw5 69, node 59, browser 19). Build clean.

### §8 Archipelago Gate + Test Hardening Sprint

**`federation-seam.test.ts` — §8 pure Repo gate:**
- Two in-process Repos joined by one `MessageChannel` via `MessageChannelNetworkAdapter`.
- Test 1: vessel doc change propagates to island via CRDT — no manifest payload, no `routeChangeset`.
- Test 2: island doc change propagates back to vessel — proves the channel is bidirectional.
- This is the Repo-level primitive that `VesselIslandPool.mountWiki()` and `BrowserVesselIslandPool.mountWiki()` both rest on.
- API note: `repo.find()` returns `Promise<DocHandle>`; `await repo.find(url)` then `handle.whenReady()`.

**`island-protocol.ts` §8 clause updated:**
- Gate proof line now cites both: `federation-seam.test.ts` (node, pure Repo) + `browser-repo-in-island.test.ts` test 2 (browser pool).

**`blob-sovereignty.test.ts` hardened:**
- Replaced two silent mid-test `return` guards with `describe.skipIf(skipReason)`.
- A skip in CI is visible; a silent return is not. Skip reason string names the missing artifact and the command to build it.

**`repo-in-island.test.ts`:**
- Added one-line comment at the `mountWiki` call site explaining the `b.writable` selector in `repo-in-island-echo.mjs`.

**`TALK-STORY-NEXT.md`:**
- §8 row updated to ✅ with both gate proof citations.
- Active objective advanced to S9 browser ea-path.
- Pre-flight audit of `open-node-vessel.ts` named as S9 gate-zero.
- File map rewritten for S9.

**Files changed:** `federation-seam.test.ts` (new), `blob-sovereignty.test.ts`, `repo-in-island.test.ts`, `island-protocol.ts`, `TALK-STORY-NEXT.md`, `HANDOFF.md`.

**Metrics:** 197/197 tests pass (mesh 71, tw5 69, node 52, browser 5). All packages typecheck clean.

### YIN ontology + typo closure sprint

**Pre-existing import typos fixed (three entry files):**
- `lar-wiki-island.ts` + `lar-admin-island.ts`: `import { runSovereignisland }` → `import { runSovereignWorker }`
- `browser-wiki-worker.ts`: `import { runBrowserSovereignisland }` → `import { runBrowserSovereignWorker }`

**Pre-existing runtime typo fixed:**
- `vessel-island-pool.ts` line ~469: `worker: island` → `worker: Worker` (search-replace casualty from OTP sprint)

**Ontology rename — no "manager" language:**
- `tests/node-vm-manager.test.ts` → `tests/vessel-island-pool.test.ts`
- `tests/fixtures/vm-manager-echo.mjs` → `tests/fixtures/vm-pool-echo.mjs` (old file deleted)

**Test additions and fixture fixes:**
- `blob-sovereignty.test.ts` — §6 pono federation gate: island reads `blobs[ENGINE_CORE_ID]` from `@lararium` CRDT doc, boots TW5, declares ea. Uses real `dist/src/lar-wiki-island.js` + genesis artifact.
- `vessel-island-pool.test.ts`: `FIXTURE_LARARIUM_URL = "automerge:fixture-lararium-url"` sentinel — echo fixture tests skip `repo.find()` on the `@lararium` binding; sentinel prevents `InvalidAutomergeUrl`.
- `repo-in-island.test.ts`: each test creates a real `laraiumHandle` doc for the REPO_FIXTURE path.
- `repo-in-island-echo.mjs`: binding resolution uses `b.writable` to select the wiki doc — `@lararium` read-only binding is now first in the array and must be skipped.

**Files changed:** `browser-wiki-worker.ts`, `lar-wiki-island.ts`, `lar-admin-island.ts`, `vessel-island-pool.ts` (4 src) + `vessel-island-pool.test.ts`, `blob-sovereignty.test.ts`, `repo-in-island.test.ts`, `repo-in-island-echo.mjs` (3 tests + 1 fixture, 1 rename, 1 delete).

**Metrics:** 195/195 tests pass (mesh 71, tw5 69, node 50, browser 5). All packages typecheck clean.

## What Changed This Turn (2026-05-27 turn 23)

### Pono federation pattern sprint (YIN — coreBlob eviction)

**Anti-pattern removed:** `coreBlob: Uint8Array` was carried in `IslandMsg_Manifest`,
forcing N×blob-size data copies for N simultaneous islands. Bytes already live in
`LarDoc.blobs[ENGINE_CORE_ID]` (Automerge CRDT, federates automatically). Manifest
now carries `coreHash: string | null` only — integrity intent vector, not bytes.

**`mkManifest` signature change:**
- Old: `mkManifest(wikiUri, coreBlob, syncPort, coreHash?, opts?)`
- New: `mkManifest(wikiUri, syncPort, coreHash?, opts?)`

**Boot order inverted** in both sovereign island models (node + browser):
1. `new Repo(syncPort)` — first, before anything else
2. Iterate bindings, `handle.whenReady()` for each
3. Read `blobs[ENGINE_CORE_ID]` from the `@lararium` doc handle
4. If bytes absent → `_post(mkFault(...))` and return — correct production behavior
5. `bootTw5(coreBytes)` — last, bytes from CRDT not manifest

**`laraiumDocUrl` option** added to `VesselIslandPool`. `open-node-vessel.ts`
passes `islandHandle.url` as `laraiumDocUrl`; pool prepends a read-only `@lararium`
binding to each wiki island's bagBindings so the engine bytes are reachable.

**Files changed:** `island-protocol.ts`, `browser-authority.ts`, `vessel-island-pool.ts`,
`open-admin-vm.ts`, `open-node-vessel.ts`, `sovereign-island-model.ts`,
`browser-sovereign-island-model.ts`, `browser-vessel-island-pool.ts` (8 src) +
`island-protocol.test.ts`, `node-vm-manager.test.ts`, `repo-in-island.test.ts`,
`worker-lifecycle.test.ts`, `browser-repo-in-island.test.ts`,
`teardown-echo-browser.mjs` (5 tests + 1 fixture).

**Metrics:** 194/194 tests pass. All packages typecheck clean.

**Architectural invariant:** Two vessels federating `@lararium` automatically share
the TW5 engine via Automerge CRDT. No manifest byte transfer. No O(N×blob) cost.

### GP-3 browser arc + coherence YIN sprint

**GP-3 browser gate: confirmed closed.** `browser-repo-in-island.test.ts` (2 tests)
was already passing: cold-boot path acquires without docUrl; docUrl non-null path
resolves via `repo.find(docUrl)` and proves federation seam open. Browser
`browser-wiki-worker.ts` carried no GP-3 fallback — built clean from S19.

**Island Sovereignty Law §8 written** in `island-protocol.ts` header. §8 covers
both sides of the federation seam: vessel wires `MessageChannelNetworkAdapter`
before manifesting; island calls `repo.find(docUrl).whenReady()` before `ea`.
Gate proof cited: `browser-repo-in-island.test.ts` test 2.

**Stale test cleanup:**
- `island-protocol.test.ts`: removed `"cold BagBinding satisfies BagMode cold"` test
  (BagMode cold deleted in OTP sprint). Updated `"mkManifest carries bagBindings"`
  test to use two `relational` bindings. 49 node tests (was 50 — one stale deleted).

**Fixture rename:** Both teardown fixtures had `"changeset-subscription"` mock
subscription name reflecting the GP-3 oracle subscription. Renamed to `"doc-handle"`
to reflect the Repo-in-island doc handle being simulated.

**island-protocol.md meme written:** `island-protocol.md` renamed to `island-protocol.md`
(matching the source rename). `source-file` set to `island-protocol.ts`. Full `#contract`
written: Island Sovereignty Law (8 clauses), GP grade table, all current message types,
all factories. `ea.md` pranala anchors + loulou references updated to new URI.

**ROADMAP:** Browser gate row marked ✅ Done. GP-3 Deprecation Completion Arc
section updated — all items cleared; `frame:ack → frame:ack` rename deferred
to future schema_version bump.

**Coherence sweep (Explore agent):**
- island-adaptor meme: MATCH (I-1 through I-8 all hold)
- island-accumulator meme: MATCH (A-1 through A-5 all hold)
- island-protocol meme: WAS STALE → now fixed
- voices meme: MATCH (mask layer spec accurate; correctly notes non-integration)

**Metrics:** 194/194 tests pass (mesh 71, tw5 69, node 49, browser 5). All packages
typecheck clean.

### OTP ontology + gen_island rename + dead-weight cut sprint

**BagMode cold deleted.** `{ mode: "cold" }` removed from `BagMode` union in
`island-protocol.ts`. Only `{ mode: "relational"; docUrl: string }` remains.
Two construction sites in `browser-vessel-island-pool.ts` and `vessel-island-pool.ts`
updated to use relational with empty `docUrl` fallback.

**IslandBehavior / IslandContext rename sweep** (`sovereign-worker-model.ts`,
`browser-sovereign-worker-model.ts`, `browser-wiki-worker.ts`, `worker-behaviors.ts`):
- `WorkerBehavior` → `IslandBehavior`, `WorkerContext` → `IslandContext`
- `onReady` → `onEa`, `onMessage` → `onSignal`, `onTeardown` → `onDemote`
- `gen_server` comments → `gen_island`
- Cold gossip listener block deleted from both sovereign-worker-model files

**admin:delegate-job wire rename** (`island-protocol.ts`, `open-admin-vm.ts`,
`open-node-vessel.ts`, `worker-behaviors.ts`):
- `AdminMsg_RelayJob` → `AdminMsg_DelegateJob`
- `mkAdminRelayJob` → `mkAdminDelegateJob`
- `"admin:relay-job"` → `"admin:delegate-job"`
- `configureRelay` → `configureDelegation`
- `_relayRegistry` → `_delegationRegistry`

- `_pendingRelays` → `_pendingDelegations`

**IslandKernel** (`@lararium/tw5`): `worker-authority-handler.ts` → `island-kernel.ts`;
class `IslandKernel` → `IslandKernel`; `handleMessage()` deleted (zero callers
confirmed; fixtures use raw `parentPort.on("message")`); `mkTeardownAck` import dropped.

**VerbTable / VerbReactor** rename sweep (14 files in lararium-node):
- `JobHandlerRegistry` → `VerbTable`
- `JobHandler` → `VerbReactor`
- All `create*Handler` → `make*Reactor` (makePromoteReactor, makeWhereReactor, etc.)

**Dead behaviors deleted** from `worker-behaviors.ts`:
- `WikiBehavior` null object
- `makeWikiDiskBehavior`
- `makeWikiDispatchBehavior`
- `makeWikiPrimaryBehavior` remains as sole factory

**Fixture GP-3 branches deleted:**
- `vm-manager-echo.mjs`: changeset branch, snapshotTiddlers seeding, tiddlers Map
- `teardown-echo.mjs`: changeset branch

**VesselIslandPool rename:**
- `node-vm-manager.ts` → `vessel-island-pool.ts`; `NodeVmManager` → `VesselIslandPool`
- `browser-vm-manager.ts` → `browser-vessel-island-pool.ts`; `BrowserVmManager` → `BrowserVesselIslandPool`
- All import sites, test files, and index exports updated

**Metrics:** 55/55 tests pass (node 50, browser 5). All packages typecheck clean.

## What Changed This Turn (2026-05-24 turn 20)

### Island Sovereignty Law — Isomorphic Vessel Model + GP-3 Deprecation Sprint

**Island Sovereignty Law enacted.** Seven clauses (plus §7 mainPort, §3 Safari
note) now live in `packages/lararium-mesh/src/island-protocol.ts` as the
canonical doctrine comment. Isomorphic across all vessel types — node, browser,
and any future third vessel.

**`island-protocol.ts` protocol evolution (mesh):**
- `IslandMsg_Manifest` reshaped: `snapshotTiddlers` removed; `syncPort: MessagePort`
  (transferred, required), `docUrl: string | null`, `coreHash: string | null` added.
- `mkPromote(wikiUri, coreBlob, syncPort, docUrl?, coreHash?)` — new signature.
  `syncPort` is the third positional arg; not optional.
- `IslandMsg_TeardownAck`: `docBytes?: Uint8Array` added (preferred); `snapshotTiddlers`
  marked `removed GP-3`.
- `mkTeardownAck(opts)` factory: opts-object form, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`-safe.
- NEW `extractTiddlerDeltaFromPatches(doc, patches)` — island-side tiddler delta from
  Automerge patches. Removes the oracle-on-vessel need.
- NEW `allTiddlersFromDoc(doc)` — materialize all tiddlers for initial TW5 load.
- `IslandMsg_FrameAck` + `mkFrame` + `mkFrameAck` marked `removed GP-3`.
- Island Sovereignty Law §7: vessel MUST close `mainPort` before/after `terminate()`.
  Structural invariant, not convention. Both vessels enforce it.
- Island Sovereignty Law §3: Safari rAF gap named — `setTimeout(16)` fallback required.

**`browser-wiki-worker.ts` — fully implemented (browser vessel):**
- Repo-in-island via transferred `syncPort`.
- `requestAnimationFrame` drain with `typeof self.requestAnimationFrame === "function"`
  guard + `setTimeout(16)` Safari fallback. Both paths map to `_scheduleFrame`.
- `automergeSave` on teardown — `docBytes` in `teardown:ack` preferred over tiddler list.
- GP-3 fallback: `changeset` messages push to pending arrays (deprecated path survives).

**`BrowserVmManager` — new file (browser vessel):**
- `MessageChannel` per slot: main keeps `port1`, island receives `port2` (syncPort).
- Optional `mainRepo?: Repo` — when provided, wires `MessageChannelNetworkAdapter(port1)`.
- `mountWiki/unmountWiki/disposeAll` — Node-parallel API; no lease/receipt/capability layer.
- `mainPort.close()` before `worker.terminate()` in `unmountWiki()` — law §7 compliant.

**`lar-wiki-worker.ts` — Repo-in-island path wired (node vessel):**
- `setInterval(16ms).unref()` drain loop — does not hold process alive.
- `syncPort` presence gated: if provided, boots Repo-in-island + subscribes handle.
  If absent, GP-3 deprecated changeset path remains active for backward compat.
- `automergeSave` on teardown — `docBytes` captured when `_docHandle` non-null.

**`NodeVmManager` — GP-3 deprecation markers + MessageChannel wiring:**
- `WorkerHotSlot`: `mainPort: MessagePort` added (structural). `unsubChange`,
  `changesetQueue`, `awaitingAck` marked `removed GP-3 oracle path`.
- `NodeVmManagerOptions`: `mainRepo?: Repo` added — optional CRDT sync wiring.
- `mountWiki`: creates `MessageChannel`; optionally wires `mainPort` →
  `MessageChannelNetworkAdapter` on mainRepo; passes `syncPort` in `mkPromote`;
  transfers `[syncPort]` in `postMessage`.
- `unmountWiki`: closes `mainPort`, captures `docBytes` from `teardown:ack` into
  `VmSnapshot.docBytes` (preferred). Tiddler count log updated to show docBytes size.
- `routeChangeset`: marked `removed GP-3 oracle path`.
- `_subscribeDocChanges`: marked `removed GP-3 oracle path`.
- `VmSnapshot.docBytes?: Uint8Array` added; `tiddlers` marked `removed GP-3`.
- `_sendAndAwait` transferList typed `(ArrayBuffer | MessagePort)[]` — avoids stale
  `TransferListItem` deprecated alias from `@types/node`.

**`IslandKernel` refactored (`@lararium/tw5`):**
- New sovereignty-law API: `bootTw5(wikiUri, coreBlob)`, `applyDelta(wikiUri, added, deleted)`,
  `sendEa(wikiUri)`, `sendFrameAck(wikiUri, frameId)`, `teardown()`.
- `handleMessage(raw)` marked `superseded` — kept for GP-3 fixture islands.
- `TeardownResult` interface exported.

**Tests updated:**
- `island-protocol.test.ts` (node): `mkPromote` calls updated to supply `MessagePort`
  from `new MessageChannel()`.
- `worker-lifecycle.test.ts` (browser): same `mkPromote` signature fix.
- `node-vm-manager.test.ts`: `re-mountWiki` test reframed — asserts cold snapshot
  captures tiddlers (GP-3 teardown path) and re-mounted island is live + responsive.
  Removes `totalTiddlers >= 1` assertion (warm-start now requires Repo sync, not
  tiddler injection in promote).

**Safari rAF gap patched:**
- `browser-wiki-worker.ts`: `_scheduleFrame` const detects `typeof self.requestAnimationFrame`
  at module load; falls back to `setTimeout(cb, 16)`. Zero cost when rAF is available.

**Research findings (two agents):**
- Automerge `MessageChannelNetworkAdapter` is the official Repo-in-island adapter — on golden path.
- Safari shows no intent to ship `DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope.requestAnimationFrame` (as of 2026).
- Comlink documents the GC leak pattern for MessagePort — our `mainPort.close()` law is correct defense.
- No prior art combines CRDT-in-island + MessageChannel isolation + causal island framing cohesively. Pattern appears novel.
- Closest federation ancestors: SSB sigchain gossip (topology), Spritely OCapN/CapTP (capability routing), DXOS HALO (identity). None combine all three.
- Gap confirmed: no system combines invite-only bootstrapping + independent operator storage + capability-based cross-operator trust.

**Metrics:** 192/192 tests pass (mesh 67, tw5 81, node 40, browser 4). All packages typecheck clean.

**`docUrl` federation seam:** remains `null` in both vessels. When non-null, a island
calling `repo.find(docUrl).whenReady()` will sync a remote bag without any protocol change.
The archipelago forms the moment a bag mirror config carries a remote AutomergeUrl.

### lararium-browser S2 + YIN bag-URI ontology sprint

**island-protocol.ts moved node → mesh.** The shim that briefly lived in
`@lararium/node` dissolved in the same turn. Three node source files and two
test files import protocol types directly from `@lararium/mesh`.

**IslandKernel** extracted from `lar-wiki-worker.ts` into
`@lararium/tw5/src/worker-authority-handler.ts`. Owns the isomorphic TW5 boot /
changeset-apply / teardown sequence. Node worker shrunk to a 10-line I/O binding.
Browser worker (`browser-wiki-worker.ts`) carries the same shape with
`self.addEventListener` instead of `parentPort.on`.

**`@lararium/browser` scaffolded:** `package.json`, three tsconfigs,
`vitest.config.ts`, `src/index.ts` stub, `src/browser-wiki-worker.ts`. No exports
yet — nothing re-exported until a consumer arrives. passWithNoTests.

**bags/ URI schema unified.** All `bags/` paths and `iam` `uri-path`/`file-path`
fields now follow the canonical form `@bag/{lane}/{rest}`. Old form
`@bag/{lane}/{rest}` — the "version in the wrong place" — purged everywhere.
500+ file moves + iam field rewrites across `@lares`, `@lararium`, `@ftls`,
`@elyncia`. Zero old-form strings survive in bags, packages, or scripts.

**`island-protocol.md` meme** moved from node lane to mesh lane, `source-file`
corrected to `packages/lararium-mesh/src/island-protocol.ts`.

**Stale tsc artifacts** (`*.js`, `*.d.ts`, `*.js.map`, `*.d.ts.map`) purged from
`packages/lararium-mesh/src/`. Build confirmed to emit only to `dist/`; no
prebuild sweep script needed. `tools/clean-src-artifacts.mjs` deleted.

**Metrics:** 188/188 tests pass (mesh 67, tw5 81, node 40, browser
0+passWithNoTests). All four packages typecheck clean.

### S5 Quine Closed — Genesis Boot Smoke: PASS

`pnpm --filter @lararium/node test:quine` now passes. The genesis artifact carries
a bootable TW5 core + compiled plugin + 65 self-hosted SharktoothSigil grammar tiddlers.

**Bugs fixed:**
- `build-genesis-island.ts` smoke test: `.tiddler?.cid` → `.fields?.cid` (wrong tiddler record path)
- `scripts/test-quine.ts`: same `.tiddler?.sha256` → `.fields?.cid` fix; filter changed
  from `[tag[GRAMMAR_TAG]]` to `[all[tiddlers+shadows]tag[GRAMMAR_TAG]]` — plugin
  contents load as TW5 shadow tiddlers, not regular tiddlers; the plain `[tag[...]]`
  filter skips shadows entirely.
- `package.json` (`@lararium/node`): `"test:quine": "tsx scripts/test-quine.ts"` added.

**Genesis artifact:** 4 blobs, 14 tiddlers, 511 KB, CIDv1 self-ref tiddler wired.

### Web2 Smell Deleted — `/api/health` HTTP endpoint

`packages/lararium-node/src/main.ts`: deleted `makeHandler`, CORS header
(`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`), and the `state` phase object. The HTTP server
now carries no handler — it exists only as a socket owner for WebSocket upgrades.
Log line changed from `HTTP+WS server` to `WS relay`. Connect log changed from
`http://localhost:PORT/#...` to `ws://localhost:PORT/ws#...`.

### Vessel Ontology Scrub — bags docs

`bags/lararium/mesh/lar-vessel.md`:
- TOML `role` field updated to "vessel"
- `# Lar Peer` → `# Lar Vessel`
- New `## Vocabulary` section: Automerge-layer "peer" vs lararium-layer "vessel" defined in two sentences
- LP-1 renamed "Vessel before server"; body: "A Lararium vessel models itself as a participant in a causal mesh — not a server that clients connect to."
- LP-2 through LP-5, shape section, ceremony section: "peer" → "vessel" throughout

`bags/lararium/mesh/open-vessel.md`:
- `# Operator Peer` → `# Open Vessel`
- "operator peer" → "open vessel" / "vessel" throughout contract, invariants, flow

**Metrics:** 39/39 tests pass; all packages typecheck clean.

## What Changed This Turn (2026-05-20 turn 17)

### LarTiddlerRecord Host-Model Rewrite — explicit `fields` + `meta`

**Rule enacted:** stored Lararium records are now explicitly two-lane.

- `record.fields` carries the TW5 input-field bag that projects into TW5 VMs.
- `record.meta` carries host-envelope state such as `deleted`, `authority`, `sourceUri`, `contentHash`, and `recipe`.
- `revision` deleted.
- `bag` no longer persists on each record; it now travels as write context (`put(..., { bag })`) and change/query context (`LarTiddlerChange.bag`, `listBagsHolding()`), because bag identity belongs to recipe/topology, not content.

**Why:** the old flat record shape let TW5 content fields and host metadata share one namespace, which kept web2/TW5 server residue alive (`bag`, `revision`) and left collision risk at the store boundary.

**Enacted in code:**

- `@lararium/mesh`: `LarTiddlerRecord`, `LarTiddlerMeta`, `LarWriteOptions`, `LarTiddlerChange.bag`, nested `MutableLarRecord`, `AutomergeDocStore`, `CompositeStore`, command-tiddler helpers, social-doc readers
- `@lararium/tw5`: IslandAdaptor, worker/direct VM projection, memory store, direct-record builder
- `@lararium/node`: command dispatcher, wiki handlers, epoch handlers, genesis/open-node authority seeding

**Admin/query follow-up now explicit:**

- ordinary TW5 wiki projection should keep showing `record.fields`
- admin VM capabilities can project metadata and bag/topology views intentionally
- cross-wiki and pinned/live queries should use topology APIs (`listBagsHolding`, recipe stack, change bag context), not stored per-record `bag`

**Metrics:** `pnpm --filter @lararium/mesh typecheck`, `pnpm --filter @lararium/tw5 typecheck`, and `pnpm --filter @lararium/node typecheck` all pass.

### Path K / F-arc — IslandAdaptor Save-Path Debounce

**Spec meme:** `bags/lares/api/lararium/save-path.md`
Invariants SP-1 through SP-5 documented. SP-3 (draft routing) deferred pending
wiki-init flow; SP-1 (debounce) and SP-4 (ceremony routing) landed.

**SP-1 — 400 ms capture debounce in `IslandAdaptor.saveTiddler`:**
- `_debounce: Map<string, TimerHandle>` + `_pending: Map<string, PendingWrite>` added.
- Rapid saves to the same URI cancel the prior timer; only the last fields reach `_writeMeme`.
- Displaced callbacks fire immediately (`null, {}, "0"`) so callers are never left hanging.
- `stop()` cancels all pending timers; no callbacks fire after stop.
- `DEBOUNCE_MS = 400` exposed as a static constant for tests.

**New test:** `"rapid saves to the same URI coalesce — only the last write reaches the store"`
uses `vi.useFakeTimers()` + `vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync()` across the outbound describe block.

**Metrics:** 171/171 tests pass; all packages typecheck clean.

## What Changed This Turn (2026-05-18 turn 15)

### $:/ Title Retirement — All Lararium-Owned Tags + Titles Move to lar: URIs

**Rule enacted:** `$:/` titles remain only for direct TW5 core/system overrides.
All Lararium-owned tags, config, and state now carry `lar:///ha.ka.ba/` URIs.

**Constant migrations (source code):**

| Old | New | File |
|---|---|---|
| `$:/tags/LaresPin` | `lar:///ha.ka.ba/tags/lares-pin` | bag-residency.ts |
| `$:/tags/LaresCommand` | `lar:///ha.ka.ba/tags/lares-command` | command-tiddler.ts |
| `$:/tags/LaresCommandEvent` | `lar:///ha.ka.ba/tags/lares-command-event` | command-tiddler.ts |
| `$:/tags/LarariumProjection` | `lar:///ha.ka.ba/tags/lararium-projection` | projection-registry.ts |
| `$:/tags/LarariumBootstrap` | `lar:///ha.ka.ba/tags/lararium-bootstrap` | init.ts |
| `$:/tags/LarariumBagMirror` | `lar:///ha.ka.ba/tags/lararium-bag-mirror` | lar-promote.ts |
| `$:/lararium/parse-warning/${slug}` | `lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/parse-warning/${slug}` | deserializer.ts |
| `$:/lararium/parse-warnings` | `lar:///ha.ka.ba/tags/lararium-parse-warnings` | deserializer.ts |
| `$:/lararium/boot-splash/active` | `lar:///ha.ka.ba/state/boot-splash/active` | tw5-vm.ts |

**Ontology fix:** `"room"` → `"wiki"` in `CAUSAL_ISLAND_MAY` (causal-island.ts);
`"local-room-projection"` → `"local-wiki-projection"`. Test fixture
`@rooms/test-room` → `@lararium/wikis/test-wiki/draft`. Default `targetBag`
in IslandAdaptor changed from `"room"` to `"wiki"`.

**IslandAdaptor routing law landed:**
- Ceremony writes (promote) pass explicit `bag` field → adaptor routes to that canonical bag.
- Live TW5 edits without explicit `bag` field → route to `this.targetBag` (top wiki draft bag).

**Operator migration caveat:** Any live admin-doc tiddlers carrying the old
`$:/tags/LarariumBagMirror` tag will go invisible to `lar-promote.ts` until
their tag field updates to `lar:///ha.ka.ba/tags/lararium-bag-mirror`.
Run `lares reset --force` on dev nodes; prod nodes require a one-time admin-doc
tiddler patch before the next promote ceremony.

**Metrics:** 170/170 tests pass; all packages typecheck clean.

## What Changed This Turn (2026-05-17 turn 14)

### Shared Types Folded Back Into @lararium/mesh

**Problem:** The temporary shared-types extraction added another package boundary without surviving as a stable workspace package. The live tree now keeps those shared contracts in `@lararium/mesh`, and stale comments/docs still pointed at the dissolved package.

**Resolution:** The shared type and isomorphic utility surfaces now live in `@lararium/mesh` again. `@lararium/tw5`, `@lararium/node`, and adjacent packages consume them from mesh's public surface.

**Canonical homes in mesh:**
- `ast.ts` — PranalaEdge, GrammarRules, SigilRule, FamilyRule, Law of Fives constants, stance/tool vocabulary
- `tiddler-store.ts` — LarTiddlerStore, LarTiddlerRecord, LarTiddlerChange, ChangeOrigin, ClosureEntry, EdgeRecord, FilterEngineFn
- `meme-provider.ts` — MemeProjection interface + MemeProvider class
- `live-protocol.ts` — ReactionBinding, ReactionHandler, EdgeLike, ReactionGraph class, extractReactionBindings
- `island-accumulator.ts` — IslandAccumulator class
- `meme-recipe-vm.ts` — MemeRecipeVm interface + bootMemeRecipeVm helper

**Dependency graph now:**
```
@lares/core             (no deps)
@lararium/mesh          → @lares/core, @automerge/automerge, @automerge/automerge-repo
@lararium/tw5           → @lares/core, @lararium/mesh
@lararium/node          → @lararium/tw5, @lararium/mesh
@lararium/browser       → @lararium/mesh, @lararium/tw5     (in progress — S1 contract landed)
@lares/cli              → @lararium/mesh
```

Spine law: `@lararium/mesh` is the isomorphic spine for all concerns outside TW5 VMs.
Automerge core lives in mesh. Vessels (`node`, `browser`) consume it from there — they do not
add their own `@automerge/automerge` dep unless a platform-specific Automerge surface requires
something mesh does not already re-export.

**Updated:**
- stale shared-types references removed from live source comments and meme docs
- mesh remains the public export surface for shared contracts
- generated `dist/` artifacts rebuilt so they stop advertising the dissolved package

**Metrics:** rebuild/typecheck rerun after the cleanup pass.

### mountCamera() — three-tree chain + mountPanel() collapse

**New method on `TW5Engine`:**
- `mountCamera(mount: CameraMount): () => void` — isomorphic parse→widget→fakeDOM chain.
  Constructs widget tree via `makeTranscludeWidget(rootTiddler, { document, parentWidget })`,
  renders into `container`, registers `wiki.addEventListener("change", refresh)`, returns
  teardown that removes listener and detaches DOM nodes.
- `CameraMount` interface exported from `@lararium/tw5` (alongside `CameraRegistration`).

**`mountPanel()` collapsed to delegate:**
- Shadow root + stylesheet camera wiring stays (browser-specific).
- Story river construction removed — replaced by `this.mountCamera({ rootTiddler: "$:/core/ui/RootTemplate", ... })`.
- `rootWidget.children = [pageWidget]` deleted — camera manages its own refresh via the change listener; no singleton child wiring needed.
- `rootWidget.domNodes = [inner]` retained — TW5 internal event dispatch requires it.

**Files changed:**
- `packages/lararium-tw5/src/tw5-vm.ts` — `CameraMount` interface + `mountCamera()` + refactored `mountPanel()`
- `packages/lararium-tw5/src/index.ts` — exports `CameraMount`

**Metrics:** 167/167 tests pass; typecheck clean.

### Jest → Vitest Migration + N-Accumulator Node Wire

**Jest removed across all three packages.** `--experimental-vm-modules` flag gone.
Vitest v3.2 runs native ESM; same `describe`/`test`/`expect` API; no API changes in
any test file beyond the import line swap.

**Changed:**
- `packages/lararium-mesh/jest.config.cjs` → deleted
- `packages/lararium-tw5/jest.config.cjs` → deleted
- `packages/lararium-node/jest.config.cjs` → deleted
- `packages/lararium-mesh/vitest.config.ts` + `packages/lararium-tw5/vitest.config.ts`
  + `packages/lararium-node/vitest.config.ts` — new; `resolve.alias` array with
  explicit sub-path aliases (sub-path first, parent second — order-safe).
- All 11 test files: `from "@jest/globals"` → `from "vitest"`.
- All three `package.json` devDeps: `jest` + `ts-jest` + `@jest/globals` removed;
  `vitest: ^3.2.0` added. Test script: `NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules pnpm exec jest ...`
  → `vitest run`.

**N-accumulator wire in node peer:**
- `packages/lararium-node/src/open-node-lar-peer.ts` step 9 extended:
  - Creates `IslandAccumulator[]` — one per bag in `vmBagStack`
  - Registers each accumulator via `peer.addProjection(acc)` (sibling to adaptor)
  - `setInterval(() => adaptor.flushAll(accumulators, 200), 16)` drives the node tick
  - `stopTick: () => clearInterval(handle)` added to `NodeLarPeerResult` for graceful teardown
- Import: `IslandAccumulator` added from `@lararium/mesh`.

**Metrics:** 167/167 tests pass (84 core + 48 tw5 + 35 node); typecheck clean.

### Verse Polychronous CRDT Mesh — IslandAdaptor + IslandAccumulator Sprint

**Architectural ruling:** `$tw.syncer` provably does not run in Lararium —
no `module-type:syncadaptor` tiddler in the plugin bundle. `meme-sync-adaptor.ts`
deleted entirely. Replaced with a clean web3-native responsibility split.

**Deleted:**
- `packages/lararium-tw5/src/meme-sync-adaptor.ts` — the web2 syncer-contract ghost; 
  all dead syncer methods (`getUpdatedTiddlers`, `getSkinnyTiddlers`, etc.) gone.
- `packages/lararium-tw5/tests/meme-sync-adaptor.test.ts` — replaced by island-adaptor.test.ts.

**New:**
- `packages/lararium-tw5/src/island-adaptor.ts` — `IslandAdaptor` class.
  Causal-island ↔ TW5 wiki bridge. Implements `MemeProjection`.
  Owns: pre-sync buffer per island, `onSyncComplete()` batch flush (one `wiki.transact()`
  per island), non-CRDT immediate apply (`tw-local`, `canon-hydrate`, `lares-command`),
  outbound `saveTiddler` → `store.put()`, `deleteTiddler` → `store.tombstone()`.
  Echo-loop guard: `_applying: Map<string, ChangeOrigin>` keyed by slot.
  `flushAll(accs[], budget)` drains N accumulators in recipe priority order.
  Does NOT implement TW5 `syncadaptor` contract. `$tw.syncer` does not run.
- `packages/lararium-mesh/src/island-accumulator.ts` — `IslandAccumulator` class
  (renamed from `sync-accumulator.ts`). Frame-aligned CRDT patch buffer per bag.
  Implements `MemeProjection`. Platform-agnostic (no rAF, no TW5).
  Post-sync crdt-remote buffering only. `drain(budget)` returns + splices from queue.
  Invariants A-1 through A-5 documented.
- `packages/lararium-tw5/tests/island-adaptor.test.ts` — 48 tests covering lifecycle,
  inbound buffering, post-sync deferral, `flushAll` multi-accumulator (shared budget,
  priority order), outbound guards, echo guard.

**Meme corpus (bags/):**
- `bags/lares/docs/lararium/verse-mesh.md` — Verse polychronous CRDT mesh design:
  peer-owns-bags law, N local clocks (Signal/INRIA Berry 1991 model), VM pool (live/warm
  slots), camera model (Story River first, TLDraw.js second, many more), visibility gate
  (future), tick sources by platform, wiring law (`store.addProjection` for both siblings).
- `bags/lares/api/lararium/island-adaptor.md` — invariant spec I-1 through I-8:
  echo-loop guard, island isolation, single transact per flush, post-sync pass-through,
  non-CRDT immediate apply, outbound guards, cross-bag tombstone resolution, child cleanup.
- `bags/lares/api/lararium/island-accumulator.md` — invariant spec A-1 through A-5:
  sync gate, crdt-remote filter, drain returns-and-removes, budget cap, platform-agnostic.
  Camera projection section: each camera MAY hold its own accumulator.

**Modified:**
- `packages/lararium-tw5/src/tw5-vm.ts` — `startRenderLoop` signature updated to accept
  `IslandAccumulator[]` (plural); delegates to `adaptor.flushAll(accumulators, budget)`.
- `packages/lararium-mesh/src/index.ts` — exports `island-accumulator.js` (was `sync-accumulator.js`).
- `packages/lararium-tw5/src/index.ts` — exports `IslandAdaptor`; deprecated re-export
  `MemeSyncAdaptor` alias kept for one turn.
- `packages/lararium-node/src/` — `MemeSyncAdaptor` → `IslandAdaptor` across all node files
  (wiki-handlers, open-node-lar-peer, open-admin-vm, node-vm-manager).

**Architecture law enacted:**
- Adaptor and accumulator are **siblings** in the MemeProvider projection fan-out — not nested.
  Caller registers both: `store.addProjection(adaptor)` + `store.addProjection(accumulator)`.
- Adaptor covers pre-sync time window; accumulator covers post-sync crdt-remote.
  They never double-write.
- Browser tick: `startRenderLoop(adaptor, accumulators)` → `requestAnimationFrame`.
- Node tick: `setInterval(() => adaptor.flushAll(accumulators, budget), 16)` (not yet wired).

**Pending wire:** `open-node-lar-peer.ts` creates one `IslandAdaptor` without a corresponding
`IslandAccumulator`. Next sprint: one accumulator per bag in recipe, priority-ordered array,
node `setInterval` driver (see Next Work item 1 in Bootstrap Paste).

**Metrics:** 48/48 tests pass; typecheck clean across all three packages
(`@lararium/mesh`, `@lararium/tw5`, `@lararium/node`).

### Grammar Self-Hosting Completion — Cut 4 + smol-toml Library Tiddler + YIN Cleanup

**Grammar self-hosting now fully complete.** `grammarRulesFromText` and the TOML
monolith parse path retired in full. `GRAMMAR_TAG` as the single registration surface.

**New:**
- `packages/lararium-tw5/src/lib-smol-toml.ts` — smol-toml bundled once as a
  TW5 `module-type: library` tiddler at `lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/tw5/lib/smol-toml`.
  All other plugin modules externalize it via `require()` — zero per-module duplication.
- `packages/lararium-tw5/tiddlers/sigil-toml.tid` — `toml` data-fence sigil as a
  SharktoothSigil tiddler (`lar-kind: data`, `lar-name: toml`). The `[[sigils]]`
  TOML block in `memetic-wikitext.tid` removed; sigil-toml.tid replaces it.
- `bags/lararium/tw5/lib-smol-toml.md` — bag anchor meme at the library tiddler URI.

**Modified:**
- `packages/lararium-tw5/plugin-build/vite-plugin-build.ts` — smol-toml
  externalized for all modules except `lib-smol-toml` itself; `output.paths` maps
  `smol-toml` → `lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/tw5/lib/smol-toml`.
- `packages/lararium-tw5/tiddlers/memetic-wikitext.tid` — `[[sigils]]` toml block
  removed; ahu #sigil-registry description updated to note SharktoothSigil migration.
- `packages/lararium-tw5/src/grammar-cache.ts` — docstring rewritten; TOML fallback
  merge block removed entirely; `buildGrammarFromWiki` tiddler-only path is the only path.
- `packages/lararium-mesh/src/grammar-invariants.ts` — full rewrite; `GRAMMAR_MEME_URI`
  and `GrammarVersionGate` removed; `GRAMMAR_TAG` exported; 6 SharktoothSigil invariants.
- `packages/lararium-mesh/src/index.ts` — `meme-grammar.js` re-export removed.
- `packages/lararium-node/scripts/test-quine.ts` — steps 5+6 rewritten to assert
  `[tag[GRAMMAR_TAG]]` tiddlers present + required sigil names via `lar-name` field.
- `packages/lararium-node/tests/node-host.test.ts` — `grammarRulesFromText` tests
  and `GRAMMAR_FIXTURE` const deleted; import cleaned.
- `packages/lararium-node/src/node-host.ts` — stale deprecated comment removed.

**Deleted:**
- `packages/lararium-mesh/src/meme-grammar.ts` — 111 lines; `parseArrayOfTables`
  and `grammarRulesFromText` gone; no live consumer remained.

**Metrics:** build:plugin 18 modules (was 17); 119 inner tiddlers; 35/35 tests pass;
typecheck clean across all three packages.

## What Changed This Turn (2026-05-15 turn 8)

### Yin-Collapse Cut 1 — reaction-router.ts + fireSync Gap Closed

**Architectural ruling enacted.** `ReactionEngine` (TS inline dispatch) removed.
Replaced by nalu-driven TW5 startup module.

**New:**
- `packages/lararium-tw5/src/modules/reaction-router.ts` — TW5 startup module,
  platforms browser + node. Boots by scanning all `lar:` tiddlers for papalohe
  bindings; maintains `ReactionGraph` incrementally via `wiki.addEventListener("change")`;
  dispatches `wiki.dispatchEvent("tm-verse-event", {uri, listenable})` from inside
  the nalu hook. Reactions now fire AFTER the full changeset lands, not inline before it.

**Removed:**
- `ReactionEngine` class from `packages/lararium-mesh/src/kumu-device.ts` — replaced
  by reaction-router.ts. `ReactionGraph` + `extractReactionBindings` remain in
  live-protocol.ts (imported by the startup module).

**Updated:**
- `packages/lararium-node/src/lar-wiki-worker.ts` — removed `ReactionEngine` import
  and instance; wired `tw5.registerProjectionBus({handleLarariumEvent})` after boot;
  removed inline `re.onChangeset()` from changeset handler. island now forwards
  `tm-verse-event` wiki events → `IslandMsg_Event` to vessel.
- `bags/lares/api/pono/reaction-graph.md` — yin-collapse target section updated
  to "Landed"; fireSync gap section updated to "CLOSED".

**Metrics:** typecheck clean; 126/126 tests pass; 17 Vite plugin modules (was 16);
smoke boot clean. All probes pass.

## What Changed This Turn (2026-05-15 turn 7)

### Verse Ontology + Yin-Collapse Architecture Research Sprint

**New pono specs (bags/lares/api/pono/):**
- `nalu.md` — architectural invariant: nalu as changeset delivery wave; TW5 `refresh(changedTiddlers)` ↔ Verse `OnSimulate(StagedUpdates)` ↔ MemeSyncAdaptor flush; yin-collapse law; one-graph-not-two law; scale note. Infrastructure concept below grammar layer.
- `hoolele.md` — full pono spec: unstructured escape-hatch sigil; Verse `spawn` analogue; English alias `\spawn`; six-operator concurrency table; when-to-use law; Lararium-specific use cases (CRDT flush, VmPool, Keyhive). Completes six-operator ontology.

**Updated pono specs:**
- `reaction-graph.md` — yin-collapse target architecture section added: current provisional bridge vs. target TW5-native startup module; `fireSync` gap documented (fires inline, not tick-driven); prior art (Elm, Solid.js, MobX, Esterel/Lustre).
- `nihomano-sigils.md` — concurrency cluster updated: `hoolele/\spawn` (six-operator completion) + `\tick/\simulate` (device lifecycle hook stub; Hawaiian name deferred) added to family list and language families section.

**New SharktoothSigil tiddler:**
- `sigil-tick.tid` — `\tick` / `\simulate` grammar stub; device lifecycle hook, once-per-nalu; Verse `OnSimulate` analogue; Hawaiian proper name deferred pending Visual Verse tick node confirmation (UE6 ~2027).

**Architectural rulings from Talk Story 2026-05-15:**
- TW5 wiki (`$tw.wiki`) IS the primary synchronous reactive engine (Elm/Solid.js/MobX pattern).
- ReactionGraph TS layer = provisional bridge; target: collapse into TW5 startup module + reaction tiddlers.
- Irreducible TS: LarTiddlerStore (CRDT), VmPool, Keyhive, network.
- MemeSyncAdaptor = minimal bridge (sea → shore); gets thinner, not eliminated.
- One graph, not two: bags = CRDT federation units; recipe stack = logical unification; TW5 wiki IS the unified logical graph; MemeSyncAdaptor per bag generates the nalu.
- nalu = changeset delivery wave (infrastructure, below grammar, not a sigil).
- `\tick` = grammar sigil stub; Hawaiian proper name deferred pending Visual Verse tick node shape.
- `fireSync` gap documented: fires inline (before nalu), not truly tick-driven.
- hoolele/`\spawn` = 6th Verse operator; completes the concurrency ontology.
- Visual Verse: vaporware; node-graph prototype under evaluation; no release date.
- Verse concurrency: 5 + 1 (hoolele) confirmed stable.

### kau.ts → TW5-Native Wikitext Migration

**No JS sigil widgets remain in the plugin.**

- `packages/lararium-tw5/src/widgets/kau.ts` — deleted. Was 150-line JS widget class (placement/invocation render, render-mode dispatch, Keyhive stubs).
- `packages/lararium-tw5/src/widgets/render-modes.ts` — deleted. Was `dispatchSlotRenderMode()` helper; comment on it said "dissolves when kau markdown-meme path folds into cascade." Dissolved.

**New TW5-native tiddlers (`packages/lararium-tw5/tiddlers/`):**
- `sigil-kau.tid` — rewritten: `\widget ~kau(p1:"")` with `p1` parse (fragment/name/props via `<$set>` conditionals), template cascade dispatch, placement vs invocation branching. Plus `\procedure ~kahea~kau` and `\procedure ~aka~kau` mirroring sigil-ahu.tid exactly.
- `kau-template-html.tid` — HTML render: placement gets `<div class="lar-kau lar-kau-place">`, invocation gets `<div class="lar-kau lar-kau-invoke">`. Hole slot when def missing.
- `kau-cascade-html.tid` — cascade config tagged `lar:///ha.ka.ba/tags/kau-template`.
- `kau-template-markdown-meme.tid` — `<<~ kahea kau {{!!slot}}>>` (same pattern as ahu).
- `kau-cascade-markdown-meme.tid` — `list-before` ordered, `lar-export-scope` conditioned.

**Keyhive stubs** (`registerKauCapabilityHook`, `registerKauWriteBackHook`) dissolved with no replacement. When Keyhive WASM lands, these surface as TW5 action tiddlers consistent with TW5 VM primacy — not JS module hooks.

**Architecture law now fully holds:** "Sigil dispatch via wikitext. JS widgets only for JS-level semantics (capability hooks, async device I/O)." No sigil has JS-level semantics today, so the plugin carries zero JS sigil widgets.

**Updated docs:** `bags/lares/api/pono/kau.md`, `bags/lararium/tw5/widgets/kau.md`, `memetic-wikitext.tid` render-modes note, `lar-sigil-shared.ts` comment, ROADMAP.

**Build:** typecheck clean; 16 Vite modules (was 17); 114 inner tiddlers; 38 shadow tiddlers in smoke; all probes pass.

### Concurrency Sigil Cluster + Grammar Self-Hosting + kumu-device UEFN Alignment

**New pono specs (bags/lares/api/pono/):**
- `hui.md` — await-all sync (`sync`); MUST spawn all, MUST NOT resume until all complete.
- `holo.md` — cancelling race (`race`); first wins, all losers cancel immediately.
  English alias: `\race`. Distinct from `puka/\rush` (no-cancel).
- `uefn-scene.md` — architecture spec: 3 tiddler kinds (type meme, instance meme, scene meme)
  + edge vocabulary + TW5 filter views + Verse effect specifier → sigil mapping.
  Import pipeline declared unresolved (pending sprint).

**New/updated SharktoothSigil tiddlers (packages/lararium-tw5/tiddlers/):**
- `sigil-lele.tid` — detached spawn; `lar-kind: concurrency`; Verse `spawn`.
- `sigil-hui.tid` — await-all; `lar-kind: concurrency`; Verse `sync`.
- `sigil-puka.tid` — first-wins no-cancel; `lar-kind: concurrency`; Verse `rush`. Comment corrected.
- `sigil-holo.tid` — NEW; cancelling race; `lar-kind: concurrency`; Verse `race`.
- `sigil-race.tid` — NEW; `lar-kind: concurrency-alias`; `lar-alias-for: holo` (corrected from puka).
- `sigil-rush.tid` — `lar-kind: concurrency-alias`; `lar-alias-for: puka`.
- `sigil-sync.tid` — `lar-kind: concurrency-alias`; `lar-alias-for: hui`.
- 8 `sigil-family-*.tid` — `lar-kind: family`; tiddlerizes all 8 edge-family contracts.

**Grammar self-hosting complete (memetic-wikitext.tid):**
- Removed 6 concurrency `[[sigils]]` TOML blocks (lele, hui, puka, \sync, \race, \rush).
- Removed entire `[[families]]` TOML fence (8 family definitions).
- Final state: 1 `[[sigils]]` block (the permanent `toml` data fence). 0 `[[families]]` blocks.
- Wild-magic property holds: grammar = SharktoothSigil tiddlers only.

**`grammar-cache.ts` — `FamilyRule` tiddlerization:**
- `familyFromFields()` derives `FamilyRule` from `lar-kind: family` tiddlers.
- `sigilFromFields()` short-circuits on `lar-kind === "family"`.
- `buildGrammarFromWiki()` partitions tiddlers into sigils and families; merges with TOML fallback.

**`kumu-device.ts` — UEFN 5.6+ alignment:**
- `KumuListenable.verseKind?: "listenable" | "event"` — `event(T)` vs `listenable(T)` distinction.
- `KumuListenable.payloadType?: string` — Verse type string for the event payload.
- `KumuSubscribable.payloadType?: string` — payload type for DEB wiring.
- `KumuSubscribable.effects?: readonly string[]` — Verse effect specifiers (`<suspends>`, `<decides>`, etc.).
- Doc comment corrected: `using { /Path }` = module import, not trait composition.

**`scanner.ts` yin pass + concurrency additions:**
- `wai` BOOTSTRAP_SCANS removed (retired sigil). `\if → heihei` canonicalName corrected.
- `hui`, `holo`, `puka` open/close scans added to BOOTSTRAP_SCANS.

**`builder.ts` yin pass:**
- `case "wai"` removed; `case "heihei"` and `case "kahawai"` handle conditional filter extraction.

**`pranala-families.md` — back-edges added:**
- 8 `<<~ pranala #tiddler-sigil-family-{name}>>` edges to all family tiddlers.

**Build:** All tests pass. Grammar fully self-hosted in SharktoothSigil tiddlers.

**Verse doc URI (from internal research):**
- `dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite` — UEFN/Verse official docs root.

## What Changed This Turn (2026-05-14 turn 4)

### lar: URI Namespace Migration + mode= Retirement + English Alias Sigils — `lararium-tw5`

**mode= retired from all sigil procedures:**
- `~kahea(p1 p2)` — KaheaTemplate cascade only; no mode param.
- `~aka(p1 p2)` — own AkaTemplate cascade; no delegation to ~kahea with mode="shadow".
  ~aka's render posture difference lives in the template cascade, not in sigil dispatch.
- `~ahu(slot uri p1)` — AhuTemplate cascade only; no mode param.
- `~aka~ahu(slot uri p1)` — own AkaTemplate cascade for child-slot projection; own implementation.
- `~(name p1 p2 p3 p4 p5)` dispatcher — mode param removed; threads only p1-p5.
- `~kahea~ahu(slot uri p1)` — passes through to ~ahu without mode.

**lar: URI tag migration (owned namespace, not TW5 core contracts):**
- `$:/tags/Lar/AhuTemplate` → `lar:///ha.ka.ba/tags/ahu-template`
- `$:/tags/Lar/AkaTemplate` → `lar:///ha.ka.ba/tags/aka-template`
- `$:/tags/Lar/KaheaTemplate` → `lar:///ha.ka.ba/tags/kahea-template`
- `$:/tags/Lar/LoulouTemplate` → `lar:///ha.ka.ba/tags/loulou-template`
- `$:/tags/Lar/PranalaTemplate` → `lar:///ha.ka.ba/tags/pranala-template`
- `$:/tags/Lar/PranalaHeaderTemplate` → `lar:///ha.ka.ba/tags/pranala-header-template`
- `$:/tags/LarariumGrammar` removed from `memetic-wikitext.tid` tags (superseded by SharktoothSigil)
- `$:/tags/LarariumKumu` → `lar:///ha.ka.ba/tags/kumu` (kau.ts)
- `$:/config/Lar/MemeticRulesExcept` → `lar:///ha.ka.ba/config/memetic-rules-except` (memetic-parser.ts)
- All cascade tiddlers (`*-cascade-*.tid`) tags fields updated.

**English alias sigil tiddlers (new; SharktoothSigil-tagged):**
- `sigil-procedure.tid` — `lar-kind: pragma-alias`, `lar-alias-for: \procedure`; with cross-ref to `wehe`
- `sigil-define.tid` — `lar-kind: pragma-alias`, `lar-alias-for: \define`; deprecated in favour of \procedure
- `sigil-widget.tid` — `lar-kind: pragma-alias`, `lar-alias-for: \widget`
- `sigil-function.tid` — `lar-kind: pragma-alias`, `lar-alias-for: \function`
- `sigil-if.tid` — `lar-kind: control`; `\procedure ~\if` body uses TW5 `<%if filter%>...<%endif%>`
- `sigil-for.tid` — `lar-kind: control`; `\procedure ~\for` body wraps `<$list filter=...>`
- All carry `lar-alias-for` cross-refs to the Hawaiian equivalents (wehe, huli, etc.) where applicable.

**Build:** 42/42 + 39/39 tests pass. Smoke clean. 33 shadow tiddlers.

## What Changed This Turn (2026-05-14 turn 3)

### SharktoothSigil Grammar Inversion + aka/kahea Collapse — `lararium-tw5`

**Grammar inversion — `grammar-cache.ts` radical rewrite:**
- Canonical grammar tag: `lar:///ha.ka.ba/tags/SharktoothSigil` (replaces
  `$:/tags/LarariumGrammar` as grammar registration signal).
- `getGrammar()` now reads sigils from all `[tag[lar:///ha.ka.ba/tags/SharktoothSigil]]`
  tiddlers via their `lar-*` fields (`lar-kind`, `lar-pattern`, `lar-open-pattern`,
  `lar-close-pattern`, `lar-alias-for`, `lar-default-family`, `lar-layer`, etc.).
- TOML monolith (`memetic-wikitext.tid`) supplies families + unmigrated sigil fallback.
  Tiddler sigils take precedence by name. Each migrated sigil's TOML block becomes dead
  code removable in the next pass.
- Change listener watches `SharktoothSigil`-tagged tiddler changes AND `GRAMMAR_MEME_URI`.
- New pattern: adding a sigil to the wiki = tagging a tiddler. No code change required.

**`aka`/`kahea` semantic collapse via `mode=`:**
- `~kahea(p1 p2 mode:"live")` — unified transclusion widget; `mode="shadow"` picks
  `AkaTemplate` cascade instead of `KaheaTemplate`. One widget, two rendering postures.
- `~aka(p1 p2)` — collapsed to pure delegate: `<$transclude $variable="~kahea" mode="shadow"/>`.
  No duplicate implementation. Projection boundary = `mode` param, not parallel procedures.
- `~ahu(slot uri p1 mode:"live")` — `mode` threads to template tag:
  `mode="live"` → `AhuTemplate`, `mode="shadow"` → `AkaTemplate`.
- `~kahea~ahu(slot uri p1 mode:"live")` — passes `mode` to `~ahu`.
- `~aka~ahu(slot uri p1)` — delegates to `~kahea~ahu(mode="shadow")`. Freeze semantics
  now live in the template cascade, not in duplicate procedure stubs.
- `~` dispatcher gains `mode:"live"` param — threads through to all compound sigil procedures.
- **`mode=` aligns with pranala sugar:** `~aka` ≡ `pranala family:observe` (frozen read);
  `~kahea` ≡ `pranala family:dataflow` (live push). The `mode` param is the short-form
  for pranala `family:` in transclusion space.

**`BLOCK_CLOSERS` + `GRAMMAR_NAME_MAP` cleanup:**
- `BLOCK_CLOSERS` shrunk from 20 → 3 entries: `{ahu, pranala, kahea}` (boot-critical only).
  All other block sigil closers load from grammar via `buildClosers()` + `closePatternToTag()`.
- `GRAMMAR_NAME_MAP` retired. `sigil-kahea.tid` merges both leaf and block forms under one
  canonical name `"kahea"` — no TOML naming seam needed.
- `CompoundSigilMatch.slotType` renamed → `closeKey`; compound forms carry `word1` (e.g.
  `"kahea"`) as the closer lookup key — fixes `<<~ kahea ahu #slot>>body<<~/kahea>>` block detection.
- `closePatternToTag()` added: converts TOML regex `close_pattern` strings to literal
  `indexOf` tags for `findCloseEnd`.

**SharktoothSigil tiddler migrations (7 sigils):**
- `sigil-ahu.tid` — `lar-kind: child-slot` + `lar-open/close-pattern`; `mode` param added.
- `sigil-kahea.tid` — `lar-kind: edge-sugar` + merged block pattern fields; `mode` param.
- `sigil-aka.tid` — `lar-kind: edge-sugar` + `lar-alias-for: kahea`; collapsed to delegate.
- `sigil-loulou.tid` — `lar-kind: edge-sugar` + `lar-pattern`.
- `sigil-pranala.tid` — `lar-kind: edge` + `lar-inline/block-pattern`.
- `sigil-pranala-header.tid` — `lar-kind: header` + `lar-pattern`.
- `sigil-kau.tid` — NEW; `lar-kind: child-slot` + `lar-pattern`; no wikitext body yet
  (kau.ts still JS widget at this turn); restores `kau` child-slot detection after grammar loads. (Fully migrated in turn 6.)

**`memetic-wikitext.tid` shrink:**
- 7 `[[sigils]]` blocks removed (ahu, pranala, loulou, aka, kahea-block, kahea URI form,
  pranala-header). 46665 → 42091 chars. 48 TOML sigil blocks remain; each migrates to a
  SharktoothSigil tiddler in Path G.SharktoothSigil.

**Build:** 42/42 tests pass. Smoke clean. 33 shadow tiddlers. No regressions.

## What Changed This Turn (2026-05-14)

### Sigils-as-Wikitext Sprint + Hardening — `lararium-tw5`

**Previously landed (prior turn):** filter self-registration, md-file-router,
memetic-parser deny-list trim (T-0), `\sigil` pragma stub (T-2), `\widget ~`
dispatcher (T-3), `~aka`/`~kahea`/`~loulou`/`~pranala-header`/`~pranala`
wikitext tiddlers, 5 JS widgets retired.

**T-1 — Wikirule Collapse (landed this turn):**
- Merged `lar-sigil-inline.ts` + `lar-sigil-block.ts` → `lar-sigil.ts`.
  Single rule, `types = { block: true, inline: true }`. `findNextMatch` claims
  block container forms (ahu, pranala-block, generic-block) when a closer
  follows; leaf forms return `undefined` and fall through to `macrocallinline`.
- `DEFAULT_RULES_EXCEPT` cleared to `new Set<string>()` — no macrocall rules
  blocked; leaf sigils route through `MacroCallWidget` → `\widget ~` naturally.
- Deleted `lar-sigil-block.ts`, `lar-sigil-inline.ts`.

**URI fragment resolution (landed this turn):**
- All 5 sigil tiddlers (`sigil-aka`, `sigil-kahea`, `sigil-loulou`,
  `sigil-pranala-header`, `sigil-pranala`) now apply
  `[<p1>regexp[^#]] → [<p1>addprefix<currentTiddler>]` before using the URI
  in `<$tiddler>` or `<$let>`. Absolute URIs pass through unchanged.

**Deserializer root-iam fix (landed this turn):**
- `memeticWikitextDeserializer` was treating iam blocks nested inside top-level
  ahu slots as root-level iam, corrupting `preIamContent` / `postIamContent`.
- Fix: limit `extractRootTomlWithPos` search to the region before the first
  top-level ahu block (`findTopLevelAhuBlocks()[0].openStart`).
- Verified: direct TS source test returns 3 tiddlers (root, `#parent`,
  `#parent/child`) with correct fields.

**Build pipeline fix (landed this turn):**
- `vite.plugin.config.ts`: `buildPluginCjsTiddlers()` now calls
  `rmSync(outDir)` + `mkdirSync(outDir)` before the Vite build loop.
  Stale `.js` artifacts (e.g. deleted `lar-sigil-block.js`,
  `lar-sigil-inline.js`) no longer survive into the TW5 CLI pack step.
- `plugin-tiddler.generated.ts` now contains the root-iam fix. Build produces
  56 inner tiddlers; 3/3 active Jest suites pass (42/42 tests).

**Retired this turn (2026-05-14):**
- `ahu.ts` → `sigil-ahu.tid` (`\widget ~ahu` + `\procedure ~kahea~ahu`).
  `lar-sigil.ts` now emits `~kahea~ahu` macrocall for all ahu forms.
  Decompose path (`splitRecursive`) confirmed already correct.
  Pattern for future child-slot sigils: `~kahea~<sigilName>(slot:"" uri:"" p1:"")` → delegates to `~<sigilName>`.

## Active Objective

Close the GP-3 browser arc. Then open the browser vessel's ea-path: founding ceremony
via `@lararium/keyhive`, IndexedDB storage, WebCrypto keypair, broadcast-based presence.
These two arcs together complete the isomorphic vessel law across all vessel types.

### GP-3 Browser Arc — ✅ Done

`browser-repo-in-island.test.ts` (2 tests) passes. GP-3 fallback never existed in `browser-wiki-worker.ts`. Protocol layer fully cleared (both gates). See ROADMAP `## GP-3 Deprecation Completion Arc`.

### docUrl Non-Null Gate (§8) — ✅ Done

`federation-seam.test.ts` (2 tests): bidirectional in-process Repo pair. Island Sovereignty Law §8 written. Gate proof cites node + browser paths.

### Path L / S7.4 — Admin Doc Ingress Trust Gate

- Gate admin-doc WebSocket ingress on Keyhive `cap=admin` proof.
- Operator-owned vessels only; non-operator vessels rejected at the ingress.
- Preserve command-tiddler coordination surface.
- Negative smoke: non-infrastructure vessel cannot sync admin state.

### Path K / F-arc — Save Path Hygiene (Deferred, not forgotten)

- `$:/state/*` → projection layer, not durable canon/draft.
- `Draft of *` → per-wiki draft bag.
- 300–500ms debounce in `IslandAdaptor.saveTiddler` — landed for rapid writes;
  projection auto-truncate and draft routing remain open.
- Single parser/split law across disk sync, CRDT inbound, TW5 UX save, disk export.

## Architecture Laws To Preserve

- **Bag = Automerge doc = sync boundary.**
- **Shared operator-peer law.** Browser peers and node peers share one base contract. Runtime affordances differ; authority shape does not.
- **Local intent first.** The invoking peer writes command intent locally before any bridge, relay, or edge adaptor participates.
- **Capability checks start local.** Proof verification happens on the invoking peer first; resource edges may re-check before side effects.
- **TW5 VM primacy.** If logic can live in the VM, keep it there.
- **Command-tiddlers, not HTTP/RPC.** CLI and daemon coordinate through the admin doc.
- **Receipt-tiddlers complete the loop.** Accept, reject, apply, and defer outcomes land as records, not only terminal return values.
- **Canon requires operator promotion.** Git diff remains the visible signature.
- **Admin doc stays infrastructure-only.** Federates to operator devices, not room peers.
- **Node is edge, not throne.** Disk projection, persistent relay, process control, and transport residency remain node strengths; none grant authority over truth.
- **Hot wiki = TW5 + RE together.** Synchronous tick semantics require co-location.
- **Memetic wikitext = TW5 superset.** No deny-list items without a carrier-stream justification.
- **Sigil dispatch via wikitext.** All sigil widgets live as TW5 `\widget` tiddlers. JS widgets only for JS-level semantics (async device I/O, future Keyhive WASM hooks).
- **Every first-class record id uses `lar:`.** Hostful ids name live session artifacts; hostless ids name stored artifacts.
- **`lar:///ha.ka.ba/*` names stable l-space.** `lar:///haWord.kaWord.baWord/*` names unstable l-space.

## Path M / Lares Local Intent Bridge

- Shared aim: CLI, browser UX, and any future operator surface all author the same durable command records through the operator peer.
- Default local CLI/daemon bridge: `stdio`.
- Unix socket support can follow under the same bridge envelope for resident-daemon ergonomics.
- WebSocket belongs on operator-device ingress or future peer-facing sync, not on the default local CLI path.
- Command tiddlers and receipt tiddlers stay the coordination artifacts.
- The TW5 VM pool should author, route, and write records whenever the work can stay inside that pool.
- Bridge code transports envelopes; it does not own ceremony meaning.

## Test Layout

- Active package tests: `packages/*/tests/`.
- Active daemon/CLI flows: `tests/lararium-tw5/`, run via `tests/bin/run-flow.sh`.
- Old HUD / memes / chats behavioral plans: `tests/chats/`.

## Do Not Re-Decide

- `@lares/cli` remains its own package.
- `@keyhive/keyhive` / concap remains the capability substrate; do not pivot to UCAN.
- `lares promote` means explicit operator ceremony, not automatic sync.
- Canonical Lares system tiddlers use `lar:///` titles.
- `<<~/sigil>>` closing tag convention (not `<<\~sigil>>`); the `/end` HTML convention holds.
- Remaining docs/history belong under `wikis/lares-history/`, not active handoff files.

## Downstream Parking Lot — Lararium TW5 `$:/` Namespace Retirement

> Added: 2026-05-14
> Status: parked downstream; do not block current Vite/plugin build tightening.

Policy direction: **our owned tiddlers SHALL live in `lar:///` space** (hosted or
hostless). `$:/` remains acceptable only when addressing TW5 core/system
contracts that TW5 itself owns.

### Actual owned `$:/` title found

Generated compatibility artifact only:

- `packages/lararium-tw5/dist-plugin/lares-memetic-wikitext.tid`
  - `title: $:/plugins/lares/memetic-wikitext`
  - Canonical artifact remains `lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/plugins/lares/memetic-wikitext`.
  - Decision needed: keep as explicitly non-canonical vanilla TW5 drag/drop
    export, or remove the `$:/plugins/...` variant entirely.

### Owned `$:/` tag/config/state references to migrate

These are not source tiddler titles today, but they are Lararium-owned namespace
surface and should move to `lar:///...` contracts in a later pass:

- `$:/tags/LarariumGrammar` ← **superceded by `lar:///ha.ka.ba/tags/SharktoothSigil`** (grammar-cache.ts rewritten); retire from all remaining tiddlers in the namespace migration pass
- `$:/tags/LarariumKumu`
- `$:/tags/Lar/AhuTemplate`
- `$:/tags/Lar/AkaTemplate`
- `$:/tags/Lar/KaheaTemplate`
- `$:/tags/Lar/LoulouTemplate`
- `$:/tags/Lar/PranalaTemplate`
- `$:/tags/Lar/PranalaHeaderTemplate`
- `$:/config/Lar/MemeticRulesExcept`
- `$:/config/Lar/AhuTemplate/...`
- `$:/lararium/parse-warning/...`
- `$:/lararium/parse-warnings`
- `$:/lararium/boot-splash/active`

### TW5-owned `$:/` references that may remain

- `$:/core/...`
- `$:/tags/Global`
- `$:/palette`
