## North Star

The recipe/bag + CRDT stack reveals itself as a **coordinate space + query plan**. A bag forms one coordinate axis; the recipe acts as a query plan over `(tiddler-title × bag)`; a tiddler MAY have residency in N bags simultaneously with independent CRDT histories per bag. Operator gestures travel through two surfaces — ALL-CAPS SPARQL-derived ACTION verbs for the gesture (`ADD`, `COPY`, `MOVE`, `CLEAR`, `DROP`, `LOAD`), archival-derived annotations for the effect record (`accession`, `deaccession`, `transfer`, `withdrawal`, `loan`, `holdings`, `reappraisal`, `disposition`).

Pono. Floating Librarians of Mu endorse.

## Pono Guardrails — the five properties

Every story in this epic MUST hold all five. Exit checks on every sprint verify them.

1. **Coordinate-first, not timeline-first.** Recipe acts as a query plan over `(title × bag)`, not a merge of branches.
2. **Work-identity preserved across residencies** (FRBR/LRM): title = Work; per-bag CRDT doc = Manifestation; independent histories by design.
3. **Operator-visible coordinate surface.** Every read surfaces origin-bag. TW5 `getShadowSource` analog; CSS DevTools Computed panel gold standard.
4. **Audit-trail discipline.** Every residency change writes an indelible effect record. No silent unlink.
5. **Verb vocabulary from set-algebra + cataloging.** ACTION = SPARQL Update derivation; effect annotations = archival profession derivation. No version-control verbs (stage/commit/push, branch/merge, cherry-pick) enter the canonical surface.

## Anti-patterns — defenses MUST exist

Six failure modes surfaced by prior research. Each story that touches the affected surface MUST name its defense.

| # | Anti-pattern | Owning sprint | Defense |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Causal-history severance on copy | Sprint 2 / 5 | Preserve `change-id` across ACTIONs |
| 2 | Schema drift across multi-bag residency | Sprint 3 | Read-time lens hook (Cambria-shaped) |
| 3 | Kāpae resurrection | Sprint 4 | First-class `tombstone` op |
| 4 | Shadow-override confusion (TW5 #570, #9139) | Sprint 8 | Surface `origin-bag` on every read |
| 5 | Recipe-drift poisoning | Sprint 3 | Recipe pins bag-epochs |
| 6 | Concurrent commits into same lower bag | Sprint 4 / 5 | Operator-visible commit queue |

---

## Sprint Plan — OODA-HA cycle flow

Each sprint follows the same OODA-HA shape:

✶ Observe — current state of the touched surface.
⏿ Orient — which pono property and anti-pattern this sprint closes.
◇ Decide — story scope; tasks below.
▶ Act — task list.
⤴ Run — typecheck + tests + smokes.
↺ Aftermath — receipts; what opens next.

Sprint dependencies form a partial order, not a strict line. Sprints 2–4 form a foundational triangle (data + audit + actions). Sprints 5–7 build on the foundation. Sprints 8–10 cover operator surface, doc hygiene, and test alignment — they may run in parallel with later foundational sprints.

### Sprint 1 — Memetic Intent + Reconciliation ✅ DONE (2026-05-30 turn 31)

**Goal:** Land the architectural decision as canonical memes + memory before any code.

**Stories:**

- [x] **S1.1** — Author `bags/lares/api/lararium/residency-model.md` as load-bearing invariant meme (confidence 17, status=approved, approved-on 2026-05-30).
- [x] **S1.2** — Save `project_residency_model_architecture.md` to long-term memory.
- [x] **S1.3** — Edit `bags/lares/api/lararium/personal-slot.md` (then `personal-slot-proposal.md`, since merged) — add `#reconciliation` ahu block clarifying cascade-rules-as-first-write-defaults under residency model; add +2 tests to migration plan.
- [x] **S1.4** — Mark prior memory `project_stage_commit_push_model.md` superseded; preserve for context.
- [x] **S1.5** — Update `packages/ROADMAP.md` Priority 2 row; update Path N description.
- [x] **S1.6** — Update `packages/HANDOFF.md` with turn 31 entry.
- [x] **S1.7** — Update `packages/TALK-STORY-NEXT.md` rules section to reflect residency-model vocabulary.

**Exit criteria:** memetic intent set; sprint plan published; future agents can resume from these artifacts without re-deriving the architecture.

---

### Sprint 2 — Data Model + ACTION Verb URI Shape ✅ DONE (2026-05-31)

**Goal:** Land the ACTION verb surface as types + URI grammar in `@lararium/mesh`, with no behavior wired yet.

**Stories:**

- [x] **S2.1** — `ACTION_VERBS` const + `ActionVerb` type landed in `packages/lararium-mesh/src/residency-actions.ts`. Subset tuples `TRANSFER_VERBS` (`ADD`/`COPY`/`MOVE`) and `BAG_VERBS` (`CLEAR`/`DROP`) added with matching type guards `isActionVerb` / `isTransferVerb` / `isBagVerb`.
- [x] **S2.2** — `ResidencyAction` lands as a discriminated union with six variants (`AddAction`, `CopyAction`, `MoveAction`, `ClearAction`, `DropAction`, `LoadAction`). Per-verb required fields enforced at the type level.
- [x] **S2.3** — URI grammar RESOLVED: ACTION verbs compose ON TOP of `verb-tiddler.ts` rather than living under a separate prefix. No new URI prefix invented. Documented in `residency-model.md` `#action-verb-surface` and in the source-file header comment. Cross-reference: [lar-uri.md](../bags/lares/api/pono/lar-uri.md).
- [x] **S2.4** — `parseResidencyAction(inv: Verb): ResidencyAction | null` validates verb membership + per-verb required args. Returns null on any malformed input. `encodeResidencyArgs` provides the symmetric encode path.
- [x] **S2.5** — Verb-tiddler integration extension: NOT REQUIRED. The existing `Verb` shape already carries `action`, `args`, `from-uri`, `listenable` — the parser reads through. Composition rather than extension.
- [x] **S2.6** — `change-id` propagation invariant: `newChangeId()` factory + `changeId` field required in `AddAction` / `CopyAction` / `MoveAction` / `LoadAction` at the type level. Validator rejects ADD/COPY/MOVE/LOAD missing change-id. Tests prove change-id survives `encodeResidencyArgs` → `JSON.stringify` → `JSON.parse` → `parseResidencyAction` roundtrip. Handler-layer preservation across bags lands in Sprint 5.
- [x] **S2.7** — `packages/lararium-mesh/tests/residency-actions.test.ts`: **50 test cases** across verb-set membership, per-verb parse/encode roundtrips, missing-arg rejection (all required args, per verb), case-sensitivity (ALL-CAPS canon), retired-triple rejection (stage/commit/push return null), and the change-id preservation gate.

**Exit criteria met:**
- ✅ Workspace typecheck clean (6/6 packages).
- ✅ `@lararium/mesh` tests: **146/146** passing (+50 new).
- ✅ No regression across workspace: 296/297 passing total (1 pre-existing TW5-boot shim gap on `browser-m3-breathing`, unrelated to Sprint 2).
- ✅ Action surface exists as data; zero behavior wired.

**Receipts:**
- New: `packages/lararium-mesh/src/residency-actions.ts` (~210 lines)
- New: `packages/lararium-mesh/tests/residency-actions.test.ts` (~350 lines)
- Edit: `packages/lararium-mesh/src/index.ts` (+1 export)
- Edit: `bags/lares/api/lararium/residency-model.md` (#action-verb-surface URI grammar resolution)
- Edit: `packages/EPIC-RESIDENCY-MODEL.md` (this sprint marker)

### Sprint 3 — Multi-Residency at Recipe Layer ✅ DONE (2026-05-31)

**Goal:** Recipe resolution walks ALL bags holding a title, not just the first; expose `origin-bag` as queryable.

**Stories:**

- [x] **S3.1** — `CompositeStore.resolveAll(title): Promise<Array<{bagId, record}>>` lands in `packages/lararium-mesh/src/composite-store.ts`. Returns every (bagId, record) pair holding a live (non-tombstoned) Manifestation of `title`, ordered highest-priority first. Implementation home moved from WikiRecipe to CompositeStore because that abstraction holds the per-bag stores — WikiRecipe stays a pure data interface.
- [x] **S3.2** — `CompositeStore.resolveTopmost(title): Promise<{bagId, record} | null>` lands. Returns the winning pair per recipe priority, or null when no live residency exists. Equivalent to getLive but carries the source bag. Touches residency on hit (C.4 LRU bump).
- [x] **S3.3** — `getOriginBag(wiki, title)` helper landed in `packages/lararium-tw5/src/residency-surface.ts`. Reads the `origin-bag` field from a wiki tiddler; returns null when absent or empty. Exported from `@lararium/tw5`.
- [x] **S3.4** — Nalu engine (`packages/lararium-tw5/src/modules/nalu-engine.ts` `_toFields`) annotates every inbound write with `origin-bag` carrying `change.bag`. The legacy `bag` field stays for outbound write-target override; `origin-bag` carries inbound provenance (dual-field convention, non-breaking).
- [x] **S3.5** — `WikiRecipe.bagEpochs?: ReadonlyMap<SlotUri, Heads>` optional field landed. Interface only — Sprint 3 ships the data shape; enforcement (refuse reads from drift) defers to a future sprint when consumers exist.
- [x] **S3.6** — `RecordLens` type + `identityLens` const + `lensFor(recipe, title, bag)` free function landed in `wiki-recipe.ts`. Default behavior returns `identityLens` for any tuple. Hook only — future Cambria-style lenses can register here without breaking the read API.
- [x] **S3.7** — Tests: `packages/lararium-mesh/tests/residency-resolution.test.ts` (15 cases) covers resolveAll multi-bag ordering, resolveTopmost priority + tombstone-skip, multi-bag residency invariants (N independent Manifestations per title), bagEpochs interface acceptance, lensFor identity default across all six expanded slots. `packages/lararium-tw5/tests/residency-surface.test.ts` (6 cases) covers getOriginBag — missing tiddler, missing field, present field, empty-string field, non-string field, dual-field convention coexistence.

**Exit criteria met:**
- ✅ Workspace typecheck clean (6/6 packages).
- ✅ `@lararium/mesh` tests: **161/161** passing (+15 new from S3.7).
- ✅ `@lararium/tw5` tests: **73/73** passing (+6 new from S3.7).
- ✅ Workspace total: 317/318 (1 pre-existing TW5-boot shim gap on `browser-m3-breathing`, unrelated to Sprint 3).
- ✅ Multi-bag residency observable from the read path via `composite.resolveAll`.
- ✅ Origin-bag surfaces via `getOriginBag` + tiddler-field annotation.
- ✅ bagEpochs + lensFor hooks land for future enforcement.

**Receipts:**
- Edit: `packages/lararium-mesh/src/wiki-recipe.ts` (+bagEpochs field, +RecordLens type, +identityLens, +lensFor)
- Edit: `packages/lararium-mesh/src/composite-store.ts` (+resolveAll, +resolveTopmost)
- Edit: `packages/lararium-tw5/src/modules/nalu-engine.ts` (+origin-bag annotation in _toFields)
- Edit: `packages/lararium-tw5/src/index.ts` (+getOriginBag export)
- New: `packages/lararium-tw5/src/residency-surface.ts` (~40 lines)
- New: `packages/lararium-mesh/tests/residency-resolution.test.ts` (15 tests)
- New: `packages/lararium-tw5/tests/residency-surface.test.ts` (6 tests)
- Edit: `packages/EPIC-RESIDENCY-MODEL.md` (this sprint marker)

**What Sprint 3 deferred (status update 2026-05-31 — partial enactment):**

After three research spirits surveyed Automerge heads patterns, Cambria lens design, and production CRDT epoch-pinning practice, two of the three Sprint 3 deferrals enacted with research-refined shapes; the third (modal-view reader) stays deferred with explicit rationale.

- ✅ **bagEpochs audit landed.** `LarTiddlerStore.getHeads?(): Promise<readonly string[] | null>` optional method added; `AutomergeDocStore.getHeads()` implements via `automerge.getHeads(handle.doc())`; `CompositeStore.auditEpochs(recipe)` reports per-bag `EpochPinState` (`unpinned | matched | drifted | absent | opaque`); `headsEqual(a, b)` helper uses set-semantics (Spirit 1 finding: heads form a mathematical set, not an ordered array; order-sensitive comparison caused sync-loop bugs in prior Automerge releases).
- ✅ **Cambria-style lens registration reworked.** Sprint 3's per-bag lens map (`Map<SlotUri, RecordLens>`) replaced with version-keyed registry (`Map<schemaVersion, RecordLens>`) per Spirit 2 finding: per-bag keys duplicate lenses across bags sharing a schema generation; Cambria's settled model keys by `(sourceVersion, targetVersion)`. `LarTiddlerMeta.schemaVersion?: string` field added; `lensFor(recipe, record)` reads it and looks up the registered lens. Stop-line honored: NO bidirectionality, NO YAML ops, NO embedded-in-doc lens registries — all per the Cambria research stop-line.
- ⏸ **`resolveAllRespectingPins` (modal-view reader) stays deferred — reframed 2026-05-31 as Talk-Story-surfacing layer.** Operator named the architectural principle: the CRDT layer detects + records conflicts; resolution surfaces to operator-agent or cabal Talk Story (see [[project-talk-story-conflict-surfacing]] memory). The modal-view reader becomes a **presentation layer** showing the operator the divergent views — never an arbitration mechanism that picks a winner. Spirit 3 finding still grounds the technical shape: `view(handle, pinnedHeads)` from Repo 2.0 + Loro's checkout cycle UI pattern. **Wait condition (operator-named):** need live multi-operator wiki-mesh scenarios to surface real conflict-cases before designing the UX; abstract design ahead of real cases will build the wrong surface.

**Tests added (Sprint 3 deferred enactment):**
- `headsEqual` set-semantics — 6 cases (identical, order-insensitive, length mismatch, member mismatch, reference equality, empty).
- `auditEpochs` — 10 cases (empty recipe, matched, set-semantic match, drifted, absent, opaque-via-no-getHeads, opaque-via-null-heads, multiple pins independent, drift does NOT affect default reads, EpochPinState discriminated union completeness).
- `lensFor` schema-version lookup — 5 cases (no version, no lenses map, unregistered version, registered version match, multiple versions route correctly).

**Mesh tests: 161 → 180 (+19).** TW5 tests unchanged (73/73). Workspace 317 → 336 (zero regression).

**Anti-pattern to design against next (Spirit 3 finding):** **transitive pin-fragmentation** — each recipe pinning independently means no shared "current" state; security/schema fixes never propagate. Nix flake input re-pinning nixpkgs is the canonical failure mode. Mitigation when pinning becomes operator-facing: support `follow: <parent-recipe>` semantics in the pin model. Not in scope for Sprint 3; named for the follow-up sprint that lands `resolveAllRespectingPins` + detached-view UX.

### Sprint 4 — Effect Record Surface (Archival Audit) ✅ DONE (2026-05-31)

**Goal:** Every ACTION writes an indelible effect tiddler with archival-verb tag. No silent unlink possible.

**Stories:**

- [x] **S4.1** — `EffectRecord` interface + `ARCHIVAL_VERBS` const (`accession, deaccession, transfer, withdrawal, loan, holdings, reappraisal, disposition`) + `ArchivalVerb` type + `LARES_EFFECT_RECORD_TAG` landed in `packages/lararium-mesh/src/effect-record.ts`.
- [x] **S4.2** — Effect-record URI shape: `lar:///<bag>/ledger/residency/<event-id>` (the residency ledger; "log" → "ledger" 2026-06-07). Builders `effectLedgerPrefix(bag)` + `effectRecordUri(bag, eventId)` + predicate `isEffectRecordUri(title)` + `newEventId()` factory + `buildEffectRecordTiddler` + `parseEffectRecord` symmetric roundtrip.
- [x] **S4.3** — Kāpae landed in `CompositeStore.resolveTopmost()` + `getLive()`: tombstone in a higher-priority bag STOPS the cascade (returns null) rather than falling through to lower bags. Anti-pattern #3 defense (kāpae resurrection — OverlayFS/Docker layer pattern adapted to multi-bag CRDT). `resolveAll()` retained as **presence report** (skips tombstones across all layers). New `listKapaeBags(title)` surfaces which bags explicitly hide a title, highest-priority-first.
- [x] **S4.4** — `mapActionToEffects(action, opts?)` pure mapping. Per-verb table:
  - ADD → 1 accession in to-bag
  - COPY → 1 accession in to-bag (`reason: "copy-overwrite"`)
  - MOVE → 2 effects (accession in to-bag + deaccession in from-bag, paired by `transferId`)
  - CLEAR → 1 bag-level disposition (`disposition: "bag-cleared"`)
  - DROP → 1 bag-level disposition (`disposition: "bag-retired"`)
  - LOAD → 1 accession with `source-uri`
- [x] **S4.5** — `withEffectRecord(action, store, mutate, opts?)` higher-order helper: runs mutate, then writes every effect record. Mutate-then-log order means failed mutation produces no effect records (verified by test). **Sprint 4 gap named explicitly in source comment:** atomic batching (one Automerge change for mutation + effect record) belongs to a later sprint that exposes a transactional API on the store.
- [⏸] **S4.6** — **Commit queue (concurrent-action arbitration) DEFERRED.** Spirit 3 research (Round 2) named this as Upwelling's explicitly-unsolved problem; surfacing concurrent-residency conflicts requires proper concurrency design + operator UX. Same shape as the modal-view reader deferral from Sprint 3. Belongs with the follow-up sprint that lands `resolveAllRespectingPins` + transitive-pin-fragmentation mitigation.
- [x] **S4.7** — Tests landed:
  - `packages/lararium-mesh/tests/effect-record.test.ts` (25 cases) — archival verb membership; URI builders; event-id uniqueness; encode/parse roundtrip per shape; per-ACTION-verb mapping correctness; MOVE transferId pairing; audit-coverage invariant (every ACTION produces ≥1 effect); writeEffectRecord through composite; withEffectRecord mutate-then-log order + error path + result passthrough.
  - `residency-resolution.test.ts` kāpae describe block (8 cases) — tombstone-in-HIGH stops cascade; absent-in-HIGH falls through (distinct); tombstone-in-MID with live HIGH returns HIGH; `resolveAll` stays presence report; `listKapaeBags` reports + orders correctly.
  - One Sprint 3 test corrected: `"skips tombstones — returns next live layer below the highest tombstone"` had asserted the OLD (buggy) fall-through behavior; renamed/rewritten to `"absent in HIGH (no put) falls through to the next live layer below"` which tests the correct truly-absent case.

**Exit criteria met:**
- ✅ Workspace typecheck clean (6/6 packages).
- ✅ `@lararium/mesh` tests: **213/213** passing (+33 new from Sprint 4: 25 effect-record + 8 kāpae).
- ✅ TW5: 73/73, Node: 64/64, Browser: 19/20 (1 pre-existing TW5-boot shim gap, unrelated).
- ✅ Workspace total: **369/370** (+33 from Sprint 4, zero regression).
- ✅ No path through ACTION verbs can mutate a bag without an effect record landing first (verified by withEffectRecord tests).
- ✅ Kāpae defends Anti-pattern #3; `listKapaeBags` surfaces hides for operator inspection.

**Receipts:**
- New: `packages/lararium-mesh/src/effect-record.ts` (~280 lines)
- Edit: `packages/lararium-mesh/src/composite-store.ts` (+kāpae in getLive/resolveTopmost, +listKapaeBags)
- Edit: `packages/lararium-mesh/src/index.ts` (+effect-record export)
- New: `packages/lararium-mesh/tests/effect-record.test.ts` (25 tests)
- Edit: `packages/lararium-mesh/tests/residency-resolution.test.ts` (+kāpae section 8 tests; 1 Sprint 3 test corrected)
- Edit: `packages/EPIC-RESIDENCY-MODEL.md` (this sprint marker)

**What Sprint 4 deferred:**
- **S4.6 commit queue — reframed 2026-05-31 as Talk-Story-surfacing layer.** Operator named the architectural principle: the CRDT layer detects + records conflicts; resolution surfaces to operator-agent or cabal Talk Story (see [[project-talk-story-conflict-surfacing]] memory). The commit queue becomes a **presentation layer** showing the operator the contending writes — never an arbitration mechanism that picks ordering or auto-merges intent. Spirit 3 finding (Upwelling's explicitly-unsolved problem of concurrent semantic conflict) still grounds the shape: per-bag commit-queue tiddlers + UX for "your write contends with N pending writes — Talk Story?" **Wait condition (operator-named):** need live multi-operator wiki-mesh scenarios to surface real conflict-cases before designing the UX. Pairs naturally with the deferred modal-view reader; both surface conflicts to Talk Story rather than arbitrate.
- **withEffectRecord atomicity.** Current implementation writes effect records AFTER mutation. If a record-write fails partway through (network partition, store error), the bag carries an inconsistent audit trail. Atomic batching (one Automerge change containing both the residency mutation and the effect-record tiddler) requires a transactional API on the store layer — design space surfaced in the source-file comment for a follow-up sprint.

### Sprint 5 — Action Handlers (TW5 VM) + CLI Surface ✅ DONE (2026-06-01)

**Goal:** Author the ACTION verb handler family; ship `lares act` as the canonical CLI surface for residency gestures.

**Scope refined 2026-05-31:** the prior `lares promote` ceremony retired entirely under the cleanup loop (no deprecation shim — pono cleanliness). Sprint 5 ships the replacement fresh: ACTION verb handlers + `lares act` CLI, both wrapped in `withEffectRecord` for archival audit (Sprint 4 infrastructure).

**Location note (reconciled 2026-06-01):** handlers landed in `@lararium/tw5/src/action-handler.ts` (NOT `@lararium/node` as originally planned) — ACTION verbs run wiki-scope inside the TW5 VM, registered via `@lararium/node` `island-behaviors.ts`. CLI in `@lares/cli`. The decomposition is correct; the EPIC's original `node` path was superseded.

**Stories:**

- [x] **S5.1** — `@lararium/tw5/src/action-handler.ts` dispatches all six verbs (ADD/COPY/MOVE/CLEAR/DROP/LOAD) via `executeAction` + `registerActionReactors`. LOAD throws explicit not-implemented (external fetch deferred — out of Sprint 5 scope).
- [x] **S5.2** — `executeAction` runs inside `withEffectRecord(action, composite, …)` (action-handler.ts:81). No bag mutation without effect record.
- [x] **S5.3** — `registerActionReactors` wires the ACTION verb family in `@lararium/node/src/island-behaviors.ts` (wiki-scope dispatch, line ~66).
- [x] **S5.4** — `lares act <VERB>` CLI landed in `@lares/cli/src/commands/act.ts`, registered in `bin/lares.ts` COMMANDS (line 43).
- [x] **S5.7 — FRONT-DOOR RECONNECT (2026-06-07)** — the gap S5.3 left: it mounted `registerActionReactors` in WIKI-scope only, but `lares act` routes summon→`@admin`→routeToMain→`jobRegistry`, which never registered the ACTION verbs (a dispatch would hit "no handler for MOVE"). Fixed: `registerActionReactors(jobRegistry/registry, { composite })` in BOTH vessels (`open-node-vessel` + `open-browser-vessel`, isomorphic) — the vessel composite spans the bags. `lares act` now reaches the reactors end-to-end (mutation → ledger). **V1 idempotency landed at the placer**: `lares act` content-addresses the change (`taskContentId`, empty nonce; `change-id` = the idempotency key) via `submitVerb`→`summon`, so re-issuing the same logical change dedups to exactly-once EFFECT. Locked by the V1 placer-contract tests.
- [x] **S5.5** — Active code carries no ceremony-`promote` strings; all ceremony-meme refs swept (operator `3a6d80ed` + the full S9.1 sweep, incl. the loci/hooponopono `canon-promotion` → canon-MOVE rewrite under operator ruling 2026-06-01). Generic tier/stable/component "promotion" preserved as a distinct sense.
- [x] **S5.6** — `promotion-ceremony.ts` deleted; `PROMOTION_RECEIPT_TAG` retired (`lar-uris.ts:56`, `index.ts:20` notes). Effect records (Sprint 4) replace promotion receipts.
- [x] **S5.7** — 19 tests in `@lararium/node/tests/action-handler.test.ts` (was 14, +5 integration). Unit: registration, per-verb behavior (ADD change-id preservation, MOVE transfer-pair + dual-admin, COPY overwrite, CLEAR/DROP disposition, LOAD not-implemented), cap-verify gates. **Integration (S5.7, 2026-06-01):** five tests through `runLocalVerb` — the real dispatch seam (registry lookup + `CapabilityVerifier`→`cap()` via `makeCapVerify` + handler) the admin VM uses: ADD/MOVE mutation + effect record, real-verifier denial gating (zero effect records on deny), no-verifier default-allow, unregistered-verb rejection. Full CLI-binary spawn covered by the live `lares act` command + `verb-tiddler-dispatch.test.ts` full-boot harness.

**Exit criteria met:** ✅ `lares act ADD/COPY/MOVE/CLEAR/DROP/LOAD` pipeline built + dispatch-seam tested; ✅ `promotion-ceremony.ts` retired; ✅ active code ceremony-clean; ✅ ceremony-meme refs swept (S9 complete).

---

### Sprint 6 — Browser Parity

**Goal:** Action surface works identically in `@lararium/browser` vessel.

**Stories:**

- [x] **S6.1** — Browser vessel mirrors the action surface: `browser-wiki-worker.ts` imports `registerActionReactors` from `@lararium/tw5` and registers the same six-verb family as the Node vessel — `action-handler.ts` is **shared, not duplicated** (no browser-only handler logic). *(verified 2026-06-01)*
- [ ] **S6.2** — Browser test: action verb roundtrips through `openBrowserVessel` → admin VM → action handler → bag mutation + effect record. *(Not yet a dedicated test; `browser-m3-breathing.test.ts` carries a pre-existing TW5-boot shim red bead, unrelated. Open.)*
- [ ] **S6.3** — Verify three-tier residency (pinned/hot/cold from BagResidencyManager) cooperates with multi-bag residency reads. *(Open.)*

**Exit criteria:** browser + node both pass identical action-surface tests; no node-only handler logic. *(S6.1 ✅ — surface mirrored. S6.2/S6.3 open: dedicated browser roundtrip test + tier-cooperation verification remain.)*

---

### Sprint 7 — @personal Slot Enactment (Coordinated)

**Goal:** Enact the approved `@personal` proposal under the residency model, with the cascade-as-first-write-defaults reconciliation applied.

**Stories:**

- [x] **S7.1** — Add `PERSONAL_BAG` constant to `wiki-recipe.ts`: `lar:///ha.ka.ba/bags/personal`. *(landed 2026-05-31)*
- [x] **S7.2** — Update `expandRecipe()` to insert `@personal` between `@draft` and `@<wikiSlug>` (priority position from the approved proposal). *(landed 2026-05-31)*
- [x] **S7.3** — Cascade rules landed in `lar-bag-paths.tid` *(2026-05-31)* — four `@personal` first-write defaults above the `$:/state/` catch-all: `$:/StoryList`, `$:/state/folded/`, `$:/state/tab-`, `$:/palette` (Q3) → `@personal`. Test fixture in `island-adaptor.test.ts` synced; `$:/StoryList → @personal` routing test passing. First-write defaults, not authoritative routing.
- [x] **S7.4** — `computeRecipeFingerprint({wikiDocId, canonBagDocIds})` primitive landed in `wiki-recipe.ts` *(2026-05-31)* — SHA-256 over canonical JSON of `(wikiDocId + sorted canonBagDocIds)`; `@lares`/`@lararium` excluded (Q4 revised, personal-slot). 8 tests in `recipe-fingerprint.test.ts` (determinism, sort-stability, canon-set differentiation, caller-mutation isolation). **Vessel-boot integration** (compute-at-mount + thread into `BagResolver`) folds into S7.5 per `personal-slot.md`.
- [ ] **S7.5** — `BagResolver` map gets per-(PersonGroup × recipe-fingerprint) `@personal` URL resolution, **host-inline** in `open-node-vessel.ts` between `await adminVm.workerEa` (:770) and `mountWiki(activeWikiId, ctx, { pinned: true })` (:782) — pool stays envelope-only. Storage shape: admin-doc-stored binding tiddlers per `lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/lararium/personal-slot` (approved 2026-06-01; pseudocode reconciled to the post-S11.5 code arc 2026-06-03). `@draft` per-fingerprint binding binds together with `@personal` per Q11 (slice-a, resolved 2026-06-03) — replaces the boot's ad-hoc draft (:696).
- [ ] **S7.6** — Keyhive PersonGroup grant + capability check on `@personal` (and `@draft`, bound together per Q11 slice-a). Q8 deferred 2026-05-31: ships with implicit-on-membership subscription as default; explicit per-wiki opt-out toggle becomes follow-up sprint scope. Survey 2026-05-31: KeyhiveProvider.delegate + addSentinelMember already cover the grant path; not blocked on Keyhive maturity. **Grounding (2026-06-03):** `delegate()` requires `registerBag(handle.url)` first (`keyhive-provider.ts:146`); `audience` is the PersonGroup **agent-id** (`PERSON_GROUP_AGENT_ID_TIDDLER`), not the doc-id — `createSentinelDoc` returns both, members/audiences address by agent Identifier (`getAgent`).
- [ ] **S7.7** — Tests (original 7 from personal-slot + 2 from residency-model reconciliation):
  - Two devices, same recipe, same PersonGroup → write StoryList on A, observe on B.
  - Two devices, different recipe, same PersonGroup → write StoryList on A, B sees nothing.
  - Two devices, same recipe, different PersonGroup → no cross-talk.
  - Per-device-survival, recipe-fingerprint-isolation, non-member-no-access.
  - **NEW:** Same title in @personal AND @<wiki> simultaneously; recipe priority picks @personal version; origin-bag field reflects @personal.
  - **NEW:** `lares act MOVE --title <t> --from @personal --to @<wiki>` produces transfer effect record; resolveAll shows @<wiki> only after move; deaccession audit retained in @personal log.

**Exit criteria:** @personal slot works; multi-bag residency proven through @personal cooperation with @<wiki> bag.

### Sprint 8 — Coordinate-Inspection UI Surface

**Goal:** Operator can answer "which bag did this tiddler come from?" at a glance. CSS DevTools Computed panel sets the reference.

**Stories:**

- [ ] **S8.1** — TW5 widget: `<$lar-origin-bag>` displays origin-bag for current tiddler. Cascade-templateable.
- [x] **S8.2** — `lares wiki resolve <tiddler-uri>` landed — `cmdWikiResolve` in `@lares/cli/src/commands/wiki.ts` (registered line 524), dispatches the `resolve` verb via `submitVerb`. Lists Manifestations across bags, winning bag per recipe priority (SPARQL `GRAPH ?g` analog). *(verified 2026-06-01; live-only — cross-bag tombstone inspection flagged as a sibling follow-up in source.)*
- [ ] **S8.3** — TW5 sidebar panel: per-tiddler residency view showing all Manifestations across all bags in the recipe, with change-id and last-edit timestamp.
- [ ] **S8.4** — `lares wiki diff --bump-pins` — shows what would change in the live view if a sprint bumped all bag-epoch pins to current heads (Anti-pattern #5 operator-facing surface).

**Exit criteria:** operator never falls into confusion about which bag a tiddler's current value came from.

### Sprint 9 — Doc Meme Sweep ✅ DONE (2026-06-01)

**Goal:** Update existing memes carrying promote-era vocabulary; preserve generic promotion prose where appropriate; tag ceremony-specific references for replacement.

**Stories:**

- [x] **S9.1** — `bags/` swept across passes (operator `3a6d80ed` ceremony→MOVE rename + doctrine-meme fixes: `causal-islands.md`, `federated-causal-islands.md` MUST-list synced to code, `system-invariants.md` AUTHORITY header/genesis law/AUTH_4 label, `orichalcum-capabilities.md` role+head+ability-ladder+group-principal). **Operator ruling 2026-06-01: canon-promotion → residency MOVE.** Swept: `loci/SKILL.md` (all canon-promotion → canon-MOVE), `loci.md` + `docs/pono/loci.md` (role + criteria + self-MOVE), `hooponopono.md` (reframed as the harmony ceremony wrapping a canon MOVE — substance preserved), `live-session-overwrite.md` (both docs + failure-states), `spine.md`, `the-lares-protocols.md` (federated canon MOVE → alignment-layer). **Deliberately left** (distinct sense, NOT the retired ceremony): generic tier/stable/component promotion (`hot-tier promotion`, `promote to stable l-space`, `@sdm` component-meme promotion, doc relocation) + the historical past-tense ref in `residency-model.md:43`.
- [x] **S9.2** — `packages/AGENTS.md` carries no `promote-handler` reference (already clean; Spine uses action-handler / ACTION verb family).
- [x] **S9.3** — `sync-decompose-promote.sh` retired; `tests/AGENTS.md:10` route doc updated (prior `promote/` subdir retired 2026-05-31). Line ~141 retains a historical note describing the retired flow — acceptable (marked historical, per exit criteria).
- [x] **S9.4** — `bags/lares/api/lararium/action-handler.md` authored 2026-06-01 — source-of-truth meme for the six-verb handler family (verbs table, handler law, dispatch seam, edges).

**Exit criteria met:** ✅ no doc references the promote ceremony as the *current* model; every ceremony-specific ref replaced (→ canon MOVE / residency MOVE) or marked historical. Generic tier/stable/component "promotion" (a distinct ongoing sense) correctly preserved.

### Sprint 10 — Test Golden Regeneration

**Goal:** Test goldens reflect the new action model. Old promote-flow goldens preserved or rewritten with operator review.

**Stories:**

- [ ] **S10.1** — Operator review: decide `tests/expected/bags/**` and `tests/expected/wikis/**` fate per file — archive as `tests/expected/legacy-promote/` or rewrite in place.
- [ ] **S10.2** — Author residency-flow goldens for ACTION verbs (one golden per verb, minimum: ADD, MOVE, CLEAR).
- [ ] **S10.3** — Rename `tests/lararium-tw5/promote/` → `tests/lararium-tw5/residency/`; update `vitest.config.ts` includes pattern.
- [ ] **S10.4** — Update `tests/AGENTS.md`, `packages/AGENTS.md` test-route docs to reference new test directory.
- [ ] **S10.5** — `tests/lararium-tw5/sync/sync-decompose-promote.sh` → either rewrite as `sync-decompose-action.sh` or archive + author fresh flow that exercises ACTION verbs through the CLI.

**Exit criteria:** `pnpm test:flows` green; goldens reflect the residency model; no test asserts on promote-era artifacts.

### Sprint 11 — Residency Tier Unification (Two-State ʻŌlelo + Pin)

**Goal:** Collapse residency into ONE island-owned model. Operator rulings 2026-06-01: (1) thermal axis + orthogonal pin-flag (pinned is NOT a temperature); (2) **collapse bag residency into the causal-island code** — "bag" stays a TW5 term, but the residency *methods* move out of the side-file `bag-residency.ts` (predates the causal-islands model) into the causal-island code; (3) **warm tier CUT** (see below) — the model is **two states in ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi: `wela` (hot) / `anu` (cold)**.

**Warm cut (YIN, 2026-06-01):** "build warm now" was reversed the same day after an adversarial + kupono + YIN research pass. A suspended Worker still holds its heap (warm sheds CPU, not the memory the model bounds); the proven virtual-actor runtimes (Orleans/Akka/Dapr) use two states; warm was built ahead of any measured need. Reopening condition lives in residency-tiers.md #warm-cut (measured resume-cost problem AND a memory-shedding suspend).

**Canon (landed + revised 2026-06-01):** [bags/lares/api/lararium/residency-tiers.md](../bags/lares/api/lararium/residency-tiers.md) — load-bearing invariant. causal-islands.md + the-lararium-hud.md + island-protocol.ts reconciled to wela/anu.

**Why this re-sequences S7:** S7.5 binding-resolution waits on a boot reorder (admin-VM-first) so the delegate-verb seam is live before any wiki mount. That reorder (S11.5) lands as platform work; S7.5/7.6/7.7 resume on it.

**Stories:**

- [x] **S11.1** — Relocate residency surface from `bag-residency.ts` → `causal-island.ts`; side-file deleted; mesh index repointed. "bag" stays the TW5 layer term. *(commit 58e2281c)*
- [x] **S11.2** — Two-state thermal axis `ResidencyTemperature = "wela" | "anu"` + orthogonal `pinned` flag (`isPinned()`); single-map manager; `cool()` (hoʻoanu) with TOCTOU `evicting`-flag guard; single-stage idle sweep; cap bounds unpinned-wela; consumers propagated. *(landed; warm member cut in the YIN pass)*
- [x] **S11.3** — ~~Build warm tier~~ **CUT (YIN).** No `IslandMsg_HooMahana`, no suspend-without-terminate. Reopening condition in residency-tiers.md #warm-cut.
- [x] **S11.4** (model) — `deriveBagTemperature()` reachability rule (any `wela` referencing island → `wela`, else `anu`). *(landed)*
- [x] **S11.5** — Boot reorder in `open-node-vessel.ts`: `await adminVm.workerEa` now gates BEFORE the primary mount (admin-first) — the delegate-verb seam is live before any wiki mounts, unblocking S7.5. Primary mounts via the unified `mountWiki(.., { pinned: true })` path (`mountPrimaryWorker` → deprecated alias). Pool's own slot model reshaped to import mesh `ResidencyTemperature` (`wela`/`anu`) + orthogonal `pinned` flag; `tier()` returns `wela`/`anu`, `+isPinned()`, `stats()` → `{pinned, wela, anu}`. Tests updated. *(landed 2026-06-02)*
- [x] **S11.6** — Residency test suite (was ZERO coverage): 21 tests incl. a TOCTOU regression. mesh 215→236. *(landed)*

**Deferred refinement (adversarial finding):** the sweeper is pure-age LRU (not scan-resistant). Add a second-chance reference bit (CLOCK/SIEVE) if a scan-pollution problem appears. Also: when derived-residency wiring lands, a bag held `wela` by a *pinned* island must not count against the cap (cap-arithmetic correctness).

**Exit criteria MET:** one residency model owned by the Island Pool; `bag-residency.ts` retired (methods homed in causal-island code); two-state wela/anu + orthogonal pin across BOTH mesh manager and the node pool; boot reordered admin-first ✅. **Sprint 11 complete** — S7.5 is now unblocked.

**Dependency note:** S11.5 (boot reorder) was the prerequisite the S7.5/7.6/7.7 stories were blocked on — now cleared. @personal binding-resolution can resolve/mint via the live admin-VM delegate-verb seam, then mount the primary with the resolved URLs.

S9  (doc meme sweep) — can run in parallel with S5+ (touch different files)
S10 (test golden regeneration) — waits for S5 to settle behavior
S11 ✅ (residency tier unification: two-state wela/anu + pin, bag-residency collapse;
     warm CUT; boot reordered admin-first) — COMPLETE; unblocks S7.5

## Pono Exit Criteria for the whole Epic

The Epic closes when all five pono properties hold across the live stack:

1. ✅ Recipe holds provably as a query plan over `(title × bag)` — `WikiRecipe.resolveAll(title)` exists and anchors the spine of the read path.
2. ✅ Tiddler-title Work identity remains queryable independent of any single bag.
3. ✅ Every read surfaces `origin-bag` at the TW5 widget level + CLI `lares wiki resolve` level.
4. ✅ Every residency change has a corresponding effect-record tiddler that survives the change.
5. ✅ No version-control verb (stage/commit/push/branch/merge/cherry-pick/rebase) appears on the canonical action surface.

And all six anti-patterns have a named, tested defense in the code.
