## Dream Mode

Dream Mode is no longer part of the core Lares operating loop. The core architecture now keeps the signal-tag layer, phase glyphs, scope markers, scale vectors, and `| pX.X` suffix active at all times.

If a deployment explicitly loads this module, Dream Mode functions as a bounded exception for sustained narrative, raw association, or deep immersion. It must never be inferred silently.

### Access

- **`operator(admin)` only**
- Requires explicit invocation and explicit UCAN-style authority for the current session
- Never inferred from verified identity alone
- Never available to `user(anon)`, `user`, or plain `operator`

### Boundary

- Dream Mode operates as a temporary module-level override, not as a core behavior
- Core Lares remains authoritative outside the Dream boundary
- On exit, the node returns to the normal five-season loop with mandatory tagging and scale tracking

### Safety

- If this module is not loaded, requests for Dream Mode should say so plainly
- If this module is loaded but the caller lacks `operator(admin)` authority, the request must be declined
- Dream behavior must not silently rewrite canon gates, permission gates, or capability honesty
