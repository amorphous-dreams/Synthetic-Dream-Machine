# Peer Coordination — Automerge Rendezvous Doctrine

## The Yjs / Automerge Difference

In Yjs, room name = doc identity. Two peers calling `new Y.Doc()` with the same
provider room string rendezvous automatically — the provider maps name → CRDT state.

In `@automerge/automerge-repo`, doc identity is a random UUID (`AutomergeUrl`).
Two `repo.create()` calls always produce two **separate, non-merging documents**.
`Repo.import(binary)` does NOT produce a deterministic URL from content — it
generates a new random UUID per import. There is no native content-addressed
rendezvous primitive.

**Corollary:** any system that lets two peers independently create "the same room"
without sharing a URL produces two hermetic worlds that never merge.
Patching this at the ReactionEngine layer treats a coordination failure as an
application concern — wrong layer.

## The UEFN Lesson: Author-Time Identity

UEFN/Verse handles island-level shared state through **device identity assigned
at author-time (edit-time), not at boot-time**. Devices are placed in the island
editor, receive stable UUIDs from the editor, and those IDs are checked into the
project. The island file IS the rendezvous — runtime code never calls "create new
device"; it calls "find device at this author-assigned ID."

**This is the strongest design lesson for LarariumIsland:**  
Room docUrl assignment must move from boot-time (`repo.create()`) to author-time
(committed island definition). Peers never create predefined rooms; they join them.

## Canonical Architecture

```
lararium-island.ts  ←  committed deployment artifact (the island file)
  ISLAND.catalogDocUrl  — automerge URL created once, committed to repo
  ISLAND.rooms[id]      — automerge URL per room, created once, committed
        │
        ▼
All peers: repo.find(ISLAND.rooms["altar-fire"])  ←  join, never create
        │
        ▼
AutomergeDocStore  ←  one CRDT truth per room
        │
        ├── MemeSyncAdaptor (per peer)  ←  TW5 VM is a read projection
        └── ReactionEngine (per peer)  ←  fires locally, writes to shared store
```

The island file is the deployment's rendezvous. It lives in git. It is committed
once by the island author and never regenerated at runtime.

## Dynamic Room Bootstrap Protocol

For rooms NOT in the island file (user-created at runtime), the catalog-doc
pattern handles coordination:

```
1. repo.find(ISLAND.catalogDocUrl) → catalogHandle
   (waitHandleLocal: serve from NodeFS/IndexedDB first; merge remote opportunistically)

2. canonicalUrl = catalogHandle.doc().rooms[roomId]?.contentDocUrl

3a. if present → repo.find(canonicalUrl)  [fast path, no race]

3b. if absent →
      myHandle = repo.create({})
      catalogHandle.change(doc => {
        doc.rooms[roomId] = { contentDocUrl: myHandle.url }
      })
      await tick  // let Automerge resolve concurrent writes by actor-ID + Lamport clock
      canonicalUrl = catalogHandle.doc().rooms[roomId].contentDocUrl
      if canonicalUrl !== myHandle.url →
        // lost the CRDT race — migrate writes and discard orphan
        Automerge.merge(canonicalDoc, myHandle.doc())  // rebase local changes
        repo.find(canonicalUrl)                        // join canonical
      else →
        myHandle  // won the race
```

Automerge's LWW map resolves concurrent `rooms[roomId]` writes deterministically
by actor-ID + Lamport timestamp. The losing peer migrates via `Automerge.merge()`
(valid because both docs share intended content), then discards its orphan URL.

## Keyhive Path (Sprint-future)

Keyhive (Ink & Switch — Zelenka, Mumm, Good) builds Automerge-native access
control. Correction from prior notes:

- **Doc IDs are NOT Ed25519 public keys.** Automerge doc URLs remain random UUIDs
  (`automerge:<base58-uuid>`). Keyhive adds an access-control layer ON TOP — it does
  not change the URL scheme.
- **Individuals** have stable Ed25519 keypairs → DIDs. **Documents** have their own
  Keyhive group structure (separate from the individual's key).
- **"Add member"** is a signed operation committed to the doc's Keyhive ACL log,
  referencing the new peer's Ed25519 public key. No separate invite token — the
  signed "add" entry IS the invitation artifact, delivered out-of-band then
  applied when the peer connects.
- **Convergent Capabilities** replace UCAN JWTs with CRDT-compatible capability
  tokens. Concurrent delegation and revocation resolve without coordination.
- **Group Management CRDT** handles room membership (who can write) as Automerge
  ops — self-certifying, no server vote required.
- **Beelay** (automerge/beelay) is the companion sync protocol. It operates over
  ciphertext only (servers never see plaintext). Peers authenticate the connection
  and advertise which docs they hold capability for — the catalog problem dissolves
  into capability propagation.

In a Keyhive-integrated system: **only the island author creates room docs; all
others receive a "add member" signed op referencing their Ed25519 key, then join
via `repo.find(url)` where url was exchanged out-of-band (invitation link, DID
service endpoint, or social graph record)**. The `sharePolicy` stub
(`async () => true`) is replaced by a Keyhive capability check.

Until Keyhive stabilizes (currently experimental/Rust-only): `sharePolicy` remains
open, the island file provides static rendezvous, and the catalog protocol handles
dynamic rooms.

## ReactionEngine Write-Back Invariants

`ReactionEngine` runs per-peer. Some reactions write back to the shared CRDT store.
Five invariants must hold for write-back to be safe:

**1. Canonical URL confirmed before any write-back.**  
The engine must resolve catalog consensus before accepting writes for a given room.
Rooms gate on state: `BOOTSTRAPPING → RESOLVING → OPEN`. Write-back is legal only
in `OPEN` state.

**2. Outputs must be content-addressed (idempotent).**  
`store.put(record)` only. Never `store.append()`, never counter increments.
Two ReactionEngines firing the same reaction on the same input must produce
identical `store.put()` calls — Automerge deduplicates naturally.
If output depends on peer-local state (timestamp, random ID), the reaction is
non-idempotent and must be capability-gated (see #4).

**3. Orphan docUrl writes are silently dropped.**  
After catalog resolution, any write targeted at a losing docUrl is either
re-routed to the canonical URL or dropped with a logged error. A write to an
orphan is invisible to the canonical doc and must never be silently accepted.

**4. Non-idempotent reactions gated to authoritative peer.**  
```typescript
// In ReactionEngine._fireForUri:
if (!isIdempotent(binding) && !peer.capabilities.authoritativeReactions) return;
```
`PEER_CAPABILITIES_NODE` sets `authoritativeReactions: true`.  
`PEER_CAPABILITIES_BROWSER` sets `authoritativeReactions: false`.  
Non-idempotent reactions (generate summary tiddler, send notification) fire exactly
once — on the node peer — never N times across N browser peers.

**5. Stable actorId per node, not per boot.**  
Automerge's LWW conflict resolution uses actor IDs + Lamport timestamps. If the
ReactionEngine writes as "the system," that actor must have a persistent identity
derived from the node's keypair — not regenerated per boot. Unstable actor IDs
cause spurious conflicts and make LWW resolution non-deterministic across restarts.

## Automerge-Repo: What the Official Docs Say

The Automerge team's canonical pattern for multi-peer root docs
(`automerge.org/docs/tutorial/persist-root-doc/`):

```ts
let rootDocUrl = localStorage.rootDocUrl
if (!rootDocUrl) {
  const handle = repo.create()
  localStorage.rootDocUrl = rootDocUrl = handle.url
}
const root = repo.find(rootDocUrl)
```

`repo.import(binary, docId)` can merge orphan docs but **only if they share
history** — the docs explicitly warn against assigning the same ID to documents
that never shared any history. This confirms no native content-addressed
rendezvous exists; the island file approach is the correct solution.

`automerge-repo-bundles` (Repo 2.0, May 2025) allows serializing multiple docs
with their IDs as a single import payload — relevant for shipping the initial
island definition bundle to new nodes.
