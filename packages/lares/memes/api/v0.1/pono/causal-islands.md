# Causal Islands

A causal island carries its own trigger surface, event horizon, and capability gate.
The doctrine partitions cross-node causality (MUST) from within-node causality (MAY).
Content MUST NOT precede authority — this invariant has no exceptions.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~&#x0002;>>

<<~ ahu #law >>

## Law

**Authority-first invariant**: content (manifests, receipts, delta payloads) MUST NOT flow
until the authority graph (Orichalcum capabilities, delegations, revocations) has synced.
A relay that has not completed step 2 MUST NOT receive step 4 or later.
A peer that has not completed step 3 MUST NOT request individual meme deltas.

**Relay-law**: pull does NOT imply read. A shrine relay holds pull; it carries encrypted
offerings it cannot decrypt or render. All other abilities imply every ability below them.

**Visibility gate**: ALL six conditions must hold for a meme to federate across an edge island.
Stage band is a UX annotation — NOT a gate condition.
