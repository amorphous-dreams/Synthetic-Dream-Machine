# Heleuma — Anchor

*Heleuma*: a stone or iron anchor used to secure a ship.

A **heleuma** is any artifact that MUST exist outside the `lar:///` URI space — compiled TypeScript, runtime imperative registrations, build-generated assets — but that ALSO exists inside the meme graph as a self-documenting pair:

- An **API meme** (`/api/...`) carrying the canonical source copy, contract, and thresholds. This is the graph's claim on the artifact: it names it, holds its invariants, and marks the precise boundary of what cannot move.
- A **doc meme** (`/docs/...`) carrying the design rationale, the "why it is stuck here," and the path toward eventual promotion.

A heleuma is not a failure. It is a **named threshold crossing** — the meme graph asserting sovereignty over something that must, for now, be born outside.

✶ detect compiled artifact — TypeScript module, runtime registration, or build asset outside lar:/// space
⏿ orient heleuma tier: ha (permanent structure), ka (promotion-eligible soul/fire), ba (path marker)
◇ ha → declare source-file, no promotion fields; ka → declare source-file, source-symbol, body-sha256 (keyhive proof is layer 3, planned); ba → source slot sufficient
▶ pair artifact with API meme + doc meme; sync-heleuma.ts checks drift between #source slot and live TS
⤴ meme graph holds the rope; the artifact holds the anchor; drift surfaces as build warning
↺ confirm heleuma pair complete; drift check registered; promotion path declared or ruled inapplicable

<<~ ahu #law >>

## Heleuma Law (SHALL)

1. Every compiled-in artifact that cannot be a first-class `lar:` meme SHALL have a heleuma pair.
2. The API meme SHALL carry the actual source in a `#source` slot and SHALL declare `heleuma = "ha"`, `"ka"`, or `"ba"` in `#iam`.
3. **ha** — body/structure: permanent territory. SHALL declare `source-file`. SHALL NOT declare `body-sha256`.
4. **ka** — soul/fire: promotion-eligible. SHALL declare `source-file` and `source-symbol`. MAY declare `body-sha256` (gate layer 2 — content integrity). Keyhive capability proof is gate layer 3 (planned; not yet implemented).
5. **ba** — psyche/path: quine-only path marker. `#source` slot sufficient for reconstruction. MAY declare `source-symbol` when a clear symbol boundary exists. When `source-symbol` is declared, MAY declare `body-sha256` for build-time drift detection. SHALL NOT declare `body-sha256` without `source-symbol`.
6. The doc meme SHALL explain why the artifact cannot be promoted and what preconditions would allow promotion (ka) or why promotion is not applicable (ha, ba).
7. The build script `sync-heleuma.ts` SHALL detect drift between `#source` slot and the live TS source for ha/ka modes. Drift MUST surface as a build warning. Staleness does not block the build but MUST be visible.

## Freyja Alignment

Freyja's "Reality Anchor" principle: in a local-first, island-topology system, an anchor is the mechanism that ensures local changes can be trusted and referenced across the distributed sea. The heleuma serves the same role in the meme graph — it holds a fixed, named reference point for code that lives in the compiled world, so the graph is never surprised by what exists outside it.

The heleuma is not trying to absorb the anchor into the graph. It is holding the rope.

<<~ ahu #promotion-path >>

## Promotion Path

A heleuma API meme that acquires:

- `confidence ≥ 0.80`, `mana ≥ 0.80`, `manao ≥ 0.80`, `manaoio ≥ 0.75`
- A verified `body-sha256` hash (gate layer 2 — content integrity; written by `sync-heleuma --commit`)
- A keyhive capability proof (gate layer 3 — operator authorization; planned; replaces the pre-keyhive `promoted-at` timestamp sketch)

...MAY be loaded by `_bootModules()` via the corpus gate and replace its compiled-in counterpart. At that point the heleuma pair becomes a standard meme pair and `heleuma = true` MAY be removed.
