# Circles — Kowloon Reference Model

> Source: github.com/jzellis/kowloon (Josh Ellis / jzellis)
> Seeded: 2026-05-05 — authoritative design reference for CirclesDoc

From Kowloon's `CLAUDE.md` (the repo's own design declaration):

> "Kowloon has **no follow/unfollow system**. Instead, users organize people into **Circles** (like contact lists). Adding someone to a circle IS the follow. There are no followers/following counts, no social graph edges."

From the README (unfederated activities table):

> "**Follow/Unfollow** — Relationship visibility is private; never federate."
> "**Add/Remove** — Circles are local 'playlist-like' constructs; never federate membership changes."

This is social graph inversion: on centralized platforms, following creates a public-facing graph edge the platform owns and exposes. On Kowloon, that action — putting someone in your Following circle — creates no public record. The graph is sharded: each user's graph lives exclusively on their home server, cannot be queried from outside, and is never transmitted. No remote server can reconstruct who follows whom.

<<~ ahu #circle-data-model >>

## Circle Data Model (Kowloon schema)

From `schema/Circle.js`:

```
id          — "circle:<mongoId>@<domain>"  (Kowloon ID format)
type        — "Circle" (user-created) | "System" (auto-managed)
actorId     — owning user's Kowloon ID; one owner per circle, home-server only
name        — display name
summary     — optional description
members     — embedded array of Member subdocuments (full actor snapshots, cached)
memberCount — integer
to          — addressing scope for the circle object itself
canReply    — who may reply to content addressed to this circle
canReact    — who may react
signature   — RSA signature of id|name|to|sortedMemberIds (tamper-evident)
```

Key: members are **embedded snapshots** (full actor profile + `lastFetchedAt`), not join table references. The system does not call out to remote servers to check circle membership at read time — it uses the cached local snapshot.

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #circle-types >>

## Circle Types

**System Circles** (auto-created per user on registration):
- `Following` — people the user actively reads
- `All Following` — superset: followed servers + circles
- `Circles` — tracks circle memberships (members are circle objects, not users)
- `Blocked`
- `Muted`

**Group System Circles** (auto-created per group):
- `Admins`, `Moderators`, `Members`, `Blocked`, `Pending`

**User Circles**: operator-created personal lists (e.g. "Close Friends", "Work").

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #addressing-hierarchy >>

## Addressing Hierarchy

Every content object carries `to`, `canReply`, `canReact`. When set to a circle ID:

```
@public          — anyone, federated
@<domain>        — server members only (creator's home server)
<circleId>       — only members of that circle (must be owned by creator)
<userId>         — only that user (DM)
(blank)          — creator only
```

Enforced at handler level (`ActivityParser/handlers/Add/index.js`): rejects if `targetCircle.actorId !== activity.actorId`. A circle can only be targeted by its owner.

**Remote circles are never resolved.** Feed fan-out only checks local circle membership. "Privacy: we can't verify membership in remote circles. Performance: avoid fetching remote circle data." — `docs/FEED_FANOUT.md`.

## Lararium Mapping

| Kowloon | Lararium |
|---|---|
| `type: "System"` | `kind: "System"` — auto-seeded at node boot |
| `type: "Circle"` | `kind: "Circle"` — operator-created |
| `actorId` | `bag: CIRCLES_DOC_URI`, authority of owning node |
| `members[]` (embedded snapshots) | `memberDids` (TW5 list of DIDs); snapshots live in IdentitiesDoc |
| `to/canReply/canReact` on circle | `addressingScope` field on CircleTiddler |
| `to/canReply/canReact` on content | tiddler fields on content tiddlers (planned) |
| `signature` | `encryptedShareHint` + Keyhive capability chain (S7) |
| Never-federate membership | Circle membership stays in CirclesDoc, never in oracle tiddlers |
| System circles per user | Seeded by `seedCirclesDoc()` at first boot |
| Group system circles | Seeded when a nexus circle is created (nexus:user, nexus:operator, etc.) |

<<~/ahu >>

<<~ ahu #system-circles >>

## System Circles to Auto-Seed

At `seedCirclesDoc()` time, write these system circle tiddlers:

```
@circles/following       — people the operator actively reads
@circles/all-following   — superset: followed nodes + circles
@circles/circles         — tracks circle memberships
@circles/blocked
@circles/muted
```

Nexus authorization circles (seeded by nexus admin at nexus boot):
```
@circles/nexus:anon
@circles/nexus:user
@circles/nexus:operator
@circles/nexus:admin
```

<<~ ahu #not-adopted >>

## What Lararium Does NOT Adopt from Kowloon

- MongoDB schema — we use Automerge CRDTs + tiddler fields
- ActivityPub fan-out — we use automerge-repo sync + oracle tiddlers
- RSA signature on circle state → replaced by Keyhive convergent capabilities (S7)
- `Members` as embedded subdocuments → member identity data lives in IdentitiesDoc; CirclesDoc holds only DIDs
