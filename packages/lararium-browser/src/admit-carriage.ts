/**
 * admit-carriage — decode a carried `device-admit/v1` payload.
 *
 * THE ADMIT IS CARRIED, NEVER FETCHED. It is a capability the founder's root already signed, so it
 * verifies on its own and needs no trusted channel: a carrier may WITHHOLD it, never forge it. The bytes
 * may therefore ride anything — a paste, a QR code held up to a screen, a file on a stick, a URL fragment.
 *
 * The fragment earns its place because browsers never transmit one: the payload reaches the vessel and no
 * server sees it in transit, not the relay and not the issuer. The alternative — a vessel that FETCHES its
 * own admission from an endpoint — makes the vessel a client petitioning an authority, and demands that
 * authority be REACHABLE at the moment of asking. That is a global now, and this house does not have one.
 *
 * `parseAdmitCarriage` takes the carriage as a STRING and returns a payload or nothing. It touches no
 * platform: no `location`, no `history`, no clock, no network. Same bytes in, same payload out — which is
 * what lets the crossing be tested without standing a relay up.
