/**
 * secure-context-gate — refuse to mint an identity where the browser will not give one, and SAY WHY.
 *
 * ── THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS TO STOP ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A browser grants `crypto.subtle` and OPFS only in a secure context: `https://` with a trusted cert, or
 * `localhost`. A family phone reaching a home node at `http://192.168.1.x` gets neither, so the vessel
 * cannot mint its key and never boots.
 *
 * That much the design already knows. What makes it worth a gate is HOW it fails without one. Reaching
 * `crypto.subtle.generateKey` off a secure context throws a TypeError about reading a property of
 * undefined — a message that names neither the cause nor the cure, arriving on a phone, to a person who
 * did nothing wrong. And the WASM signer beside it fails worse: when its WebCrypto path throws it falls
 * back to an in-memory keypair that IS extractable, surfaced only through a variant getter nobody reads.
 * A quiet degrade toward LESS safety, on the exact path a household takes.
 *
 * So the gate reads the context BEFORE any key work, and answers with the reason and the cure rather than
 * with a stack trace. A refusal a person can act on beats a failure they can only photograph.
 *
 * ── AND THE SECOND SILENCE: STORAGE THAT VANISHES ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A minted key lives in IndexedDB, and browsers evict it. WebKit deletes ALL script-writable storage for
 * an origin after seven days of browser use without interaction there — which is an occasionally-opened
 * vessel disappearing, with no event and no warning. Home-screen web apps are exempt, which turns
 * "install this" from a nicety into part of the identity's durability story.
 *
 * `navigator.storage.persist()` asks for the eviction-resistant class. It costs one call, it answers
 * honestly, and nothing in this tree was asking. The probe below asks and reports, so a vessel can say
 * what its own storage is worth rather than assuming.
