/**
 * openBrowserVessel — local-first browser vessel factory.
 *
 * A thin RECIPE over the composable vessel keel — the BROWSER
 * carries the SAME capabilities as node; only the SUBSTRATE differs. The browser must NOT
 * drift thin via easy-path shortcuts (coreless boot, no residency manager, no corpus, a
 * LarVessel wrapper) — it holds the full keel. Genuine browser
 * substrate (the ONLY divergence): IndexedDB storage, WebCrypto keys, founding-via-ceremony
 * (vs node's lares-init), Web Worker spawn, NO WS-server inbound gate (a browser cannot
 * listen on a socket), genesis-via-bytes/IDB/OPFS/peer. Capabilities held in common: the
 * BagStowage mechanism, corpus loading, the verb plane, presence.
 *
 * Genesis REQUIRED (no coreless boot). The not-yet-held axis sits at anon↔keeper
 * (PersonaGroup/admin), not genesis — see project-sovereign-worker-model.
