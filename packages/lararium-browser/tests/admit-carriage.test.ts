/**
 * admit-carriage.test.ts — the carried admission, decoded deterministically.
 *
 * The whole point of carrying the admit rather than fetching it is that the crossing becomes a PURE
 * FUNCTION OF ITS BYTES. No relay stands up here, no clock ticks, no socket opens: a fixed payload goes
 * in and the same vessel-binding comes out, every time. A `GET /admit/<key>` design could never have been
 * tested this way — it would need a server, a reachable issuer, and a moment at which both were true.
