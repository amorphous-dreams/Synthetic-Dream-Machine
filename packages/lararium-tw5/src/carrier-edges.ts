/**
 * carrier-edges — every address a carrier points AT, in each form the grammar spells one.
 *
 * ── WHY THE GRAPH NEEDS ITS OWN READING ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A `lar:` URI names; it does not fetch. So a carrier whose target moved keeps rendering, keeps
 * round-tripping, and keeps passing every gate this tree stands — `carrier-shape` asks whether a file
 * is whole, `meme-coordinates` asks whether its own two coordinates agree, `bcc` asks whether its bytes
 * match their check. **None of them looks outward.** An edge that resolves to nothing is invisible to
 * all three at once.
 *
 * Measured: retiring one carrier and moving two left 66 references naming addresses that no longer
 * answered, across 28 carriers — found by hand, after the commit. Folding 37 carriers up one level
 * touched 197 references and broke none, because that scan ran BEFORE the move. This is that scan,
 * made an instrument instead of a habit.
 *
 * ── FIVE SPELLINGS, ONE RELATION ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A reader counting only `loulou` sees 149 of the corpus's 194 dangling edges. The other 45 ride
 * `pranala` and two wikilink forms — and an instrument that misses a form reports a clean move over a
 * broken one. Every form a carrier can name an address in belongs here.
 *
 * Measured over 614 carriers: 2,197 edges — loulou 1,851 · wikilink 255 · pranala 84 · kahea 7.
 *
 * Meme: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/memetic-wikitext

// AND THE QUOTE IS NOT PART OF THE ADDRESS. TiddlyWiki reads `name:value` as call syntax, so an

// receives nothing — the corpus quotes them for that reason, and every scan here strips the pair.

  // A `>` CLOSES A CALL ONLY WHEN A SECOND ONE FOLLOWS — TiddlyWiki's own `reUnquotedAttribute` law. A
  // `pranala` states its target past a bearing arrow, so a scan of `[^>]*?` stops at that arrow and the
  // sigil never reaches its own address — silently, as a form that simply reports no edges. Every scan in this grammar spells it
  // `(?:[^>]|>(?!>))*?`, for that reason. Measured: without it this reader found 0 of the corpus's 84 `pranala` edges, and reported
  // 163 dangling where 194 stand.
  //
  // AN EDGE IS THE END IT POINTS AT. A `pranala` names both ends, and only `to=` is the edge — `from=`
  // is where the carrier already stands. Anchored on `to=` rather than on position, because a scan for
  // the first address after the sigil reads whichever end is written first: it agrees wherever the
  // source is `?` and inverts wherever the source is an address, counting a carrier's own ground as a
  // dangling edge while the target it points at goes uncounted. Position is not the relation.

  // neighbours by FILE. Those links still stand, and a reader counting only `lar:///` targets does not
  // see them — 70 of them sat outside this instrument while it reported the graph whole.
  //
  // They carry no address, so they never count as dangling and never count as resolving. They are
  // named so a sweep can find them, and left unresolved because matching a file to a carrier means
  // guessing which one it became.
