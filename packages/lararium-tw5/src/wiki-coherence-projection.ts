/**
 * wiki-coherence-projection — the wiki-sensorium's consistency radius made a LIVE coherence
 * indicator. The SECOND projection-nalu over the same wiki island, twin of tw5-projection.
 *
 * The pattern integrity (projection-nalu):
 *   SOURCE (the wiki's own consistency read — the consistency keystone's {@link WikiStoreAdapter} over the live
 *           CompositeStore)
 *     → forward-pass (projectCoherenceIndicator, PURE — a `radius reading → indicator frame` map)
 *     → NALU (a COALESCE {@link CoalesceGate} — newest-wins, a burst of wikistore changes collapses
 *             to one re-read; intermediates fade, a projection not a WAL)
 *     → SINK (a DOM coherence indicator — the ONLY platform shore; it lives in @lararium/browser,
 *             swapped per platform, `role = capability ≠ platform`).
 *
 * Where tw5-projection carries the RENDERED story river (HTML+CSS), this carries the sensorium's
 * SELF-READING: does the wiki COHERE (radius 0 → the li-planes glue) or FRACTURE (radius >0 → an
 * obstruction, localized to the offending tiddler(s) — the consistency keystone already names them). Same coalesce family,
 * same post→main-thread shape.
 *
 * THE ORGAN STAYS PLATFORM-BLIND. {@link projectCoherenceIndicator} touches no DOM — it maps a
 * radius reading to an indicator frame. {@link wireCoherenceProjection} owns only the gate and two
 * injected shores (read the source, emit the frame). The DOM write swaps in at the sink alone.
