/**
 * block-check — the BCC: what may stand between ETX and EOT, and nothing else.
 *
 * ── THE SLOT IS OCCUPIED, AND BY ONE THING ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The frame glyphs are ASCII C0 as IBM BSC (1967) and ISO 1745 (1975) used them: SOH opens the
 * heading, STX opens the text, ETX ends the text, EOT ends the transmission. A block reads
 *
 *     [SOH heading] STX text ETX BCC        …        EOT
 *
 * The BCC — block check character — is an integrity trailer, and it sits AFTER ETX for a reason that
 * is not stylistic: it cannot live inside the span it checks. Its coverage runs from STX through the
 * ETX **inclusive**, so the terminator is part of what the check attests.
 *
 * ETX is also where a verdict falls. In BSC it "calls for a reply": the receiver checks the BCC and
 * answers ACK or NAK. That is exactly the ingest gate's boundary — ingest · noop · conflict · refuse —
 * so the trailer belongs to the same moment the gate already decides in.
 *
 * EOT then ends the transmission in BOTH directions: nothing further is expected from or to the far
 * side. Content addressed after that is addressed to nobody.
 *
 * ── SO: NO PAYLOAD BETWEEN ETX AND EOT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A carrier that put content there lost it silently — the render simply did not reproduce it, which
 * is the inverse of a block check: BSC answered a bad block with NAK and a retransmission, never with
 * a quiet drop. `classifyPostamble` makes the slot legible so the deserializer can refuse instead.
 *
 * PARTIAL BLOCKS TAKE ETB, NEVER A SECOND ETX. BSC terminated a non-final block with ETB (0x17) and
 * reserved ETX for the last one. Two ETXs would assert two verdicts on one transmission — which is
 * the shape to reach for if a carrier is ever split, or streamed during a residency move.

// `>` inside `-> ?`. Only the entity alternation travels; every anchor here stays where it stands.

/**
 * The check as the spec writes it: `<namespace>:<16 hex digits>`, standing directly after the ETX sigil.
 * THE NAMESPACE HALF HOLDS WHATEVER THE OPERATOR DECLARED, and two shapes broke patterns that assumed
 * otherwise: it MAY stand EMPTY — most carriers declare no resonance glyph, and their check reads
 * `:<16 hex>` — and it MAY CARRY A SPACE, because `ॐ ँ` is two codepoints with one between them. Each
 * assumption reported the check as foreign content stranded past ETX: the exact fault it rules out.
 *
 * A block runs `STX -> text -> ETX -> BCC` and the check follows the terminator with nothing between —
 * the position a receiver has always read it from. The value derives; `carrier-check.ts` computes it
 * over the framed span, and this module only says whether one STANDS. Present and CORRECT are different
 * questions, and a classifier that answered the first under the name of the second would invite the
 * reading that a present postamble is a verified one.
