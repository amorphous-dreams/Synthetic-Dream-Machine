/**
 * wiki-store-adapter — the pure-read SNAPSHOT projection that lets a VM-less wiki-causal-island
 * sense its OWN wikistore, isomorphic to the py-over-mempalace sensorium read. It folds the
 * composite's causal-stamped {@link CompositeEntry} surface through the shared wiki-sense fold
 * (wiki-sense-fold.ts — the ONE math, whose pono home ships in the plugin blob) into per-tiddler
 * LI (sheaf) plane readings, then runs the Robinson {@link consistencyRadius} over the ENGINEERED
 * cross-plane stalk. The cheapest planes sense end-to-end — structure ⊥ form — leaving content
 * (embeddings) to the perceiver's semantic shore.
 *
 * THE HULL RUNS PLATFORM-BLIND: pure organs only, so the SAME hull stands on node AND in a
 * browser worker. The islands differ by GRANT (which bags each mounts), never by hull; that single
 * cross-substrate identity IS the island-isomorphism the witness proves.
 *
 * THE ENGINEERED STALK (the vacuous-overlap trap): the comparison stalk carries the TITLE universe
 * every plane speaks to, so structure and form share a genuine overlap and the radius reads
 * NON-VACUOUS. Both planes assign every resolved title a [0,1] load salience through their own
 * lens: structure sees the RED sigil register, form sees the RECURRING shingle grammar. A tiddler
 * rich in one lens and bare in the other DIVERGES the planes — a localized obstruction; a corpus
 * where the two lenses track each other GLUES (radius 0).
