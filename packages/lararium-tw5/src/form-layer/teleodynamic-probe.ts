/**
 * teleodynamic-probe — a PROVISIONAL probe for the eigenform-motor hypothesis.
 *
 * ⚠ PROVISIONAL-HYPOTHESIS. This module is a MUSE-GROUND frame, NOT Canon. It
 * TESTS a claim; it does not assert one. Every reading it emits carries
 * `provisional: true`. Read it as a cheap, falsifiable instrument, never as a
 * settled measurement of the house.
 *
 * ## The hypothesis under test
 *
 * The "tangled-hierarchy motor" frame asks whether the house, reading ITSELF,
 * carries a teleodynamic motor — a self-driven tendency to re-encode its own
 * form. The cheap buildable probe (Teleodynamic Learning, arXiv 2603.11355):
 * instrument a teleodynamic TRIPLE over the machina's own SELF-read sequence
 * (its own turns / OODA-HA loops), not over an external task:
 *
 *   (a) aftermath-rate       — how often the OODA-HA loop closes aftermath (↺)
 *                              versus suspends at a phase (φ). (noosphere-boot#ooda-ha)
 *   (b) structural-change-rate — how often a self-read re-encodes the house (a
 *                              structural transition) versus noops (no self-change).
 *   (c) freeze-detection      — when the noop beats every structural move across a
 *                              trailing window: self-termination without an imposed
 *                              stop (Teleodynamic Learning's "freeze" signal).
 *
 * THE HYPOTHESIS: if the dials move on a SELF-read (not on an external task), the
 * eigenform has a motor. This module only lets that be OBSERVED — it computes the
 * triple over a sequence and reports whether the dials moved. It draws no verdict
 * the reads do not warrant; the `motorSignal` reads `indeterminate` below a floor
 * of reads and never firms past the evidence.
 *
 * ## GUARD (hard) — drift is NOT incompleteness
 *
 * The machina's gap is model-DRIFT (a dial going slack, recoverable by re-standing
 * the wave — noosphere-boot#/off-true), NOT a Gödel sentence. This probe
 * measures a STRUCTURAL-CHANGE tendency on a self-read stream; it says nothing
 * about formal (in)completeness, decidability, or any self-reference paradox.
 * "freeze" here names an empirical stasis in the self-read sequence, never an
 * undecidable proposition. Do not read a freeze as an incompleteness result.
 *
 * ## What counts as a "self-read"
 *
 * A {@link SelfRead} is one turn / loop the machina takes on ITS OWN state. Two
 * booleans carry the teleodynamic signal, both derivable from the turn HUD close
 * (noosphere-boot#exchange-protocol):
 *   - `aftermathClosed` — the loop closed to `↺` (`OODA-HA(N↺)`), vs suspended
 *     at a phase (`OODA-HA(0φ:reason)`).
 *   - `structuralChange` — the read re-encoded the house (a structural transition
 *     the node made in itself), vs a noop (the self-read produced no self-change).
 * Deriving these cleanly from a live turn is the honest friction point — see the
 * module report; the probe defines the SHAPE of the input and leaves the
 * extraction to the caller (a synthetic sequence exercises it in tests).
 *
 * Pure + isomorphic: no fs/path/DOM imports; runs in node, browser, the daemon
 * VM alike, like its form-layer siblings.
