/**
 * ingest-gate — THE CONFLUENCE: the pure three-way decision at the heart of
 * disk→records ingest, where three streams (disk · last-synced · records) meet
 * and reconcile — a conflict SURFACES rather than one stream drowning another
 * (Unison's law: surface, never overwrite). The human-facing name for this flow
 * is "the Confluence" (the Nucleus triangle; handoff #pattern-integrities §6).
 *
 * ONE gate, parameterized by a semantic congruence `≈` (Unison + SafeMerge: a
 * merge stays conflict-free BECAUSE it reads through a congruence, never raw
 * bytes). The `IngestOps` bundle carries that congruence for a carrier family:
 * how the family deserializes disk bytes, renders records to the canonical text
 * the gate hashes (`render(parse(disk)) ≈ current` names "framing only"), which
 * structural surface a round-trip MUST preserve, and how it grades a fault. The
 * DEFAULT ops read the memetic-wikitext family; a native filetype passes its own
 * `IngestOps`, so BOTH carrier families run this one triangle — one decision path,
 * each family reading it through its own congruence.
 *
 * Three states meet per carrier:
 *   - the DISK bytes (what the operator's hands left),
 *   - the SYNCED hash (last-projected canonical bytes — the merge base),
 *   - the RECORDS' current canonical render (the merge seat's view).
 *
 * The gate decides; it never writes. Callers (the `lares ingest` gesture,
 * later the watcher daemon) own I/O. Hashes arrive as opaque strings — the
 * gate compares, never computes, so it stays isomorphic and hash-agnostic.
 *
 * Decision law (in order):
 *   1. disk == synced            → NOOP (nothing happened on disk)
 *   2. the parse grades error    → REFUSE (the carrier stopped round-tripping)
 *      anything milder            → carry the diagnostics forward, never drop the bytes
 *      (native ops never grade error — a native deserialize throws — so the refuse
 *       leg rides dormant for that family, present in the shared shape, unfired)
 *   3. render(parse(disk)) == current render → NOOP canonical-equivalent
 *      (the edit changed framing only; the gofmt-loop guard), UNLESS the round-trip
 *      drops a declared structural slot (the ahu-fidelity guard; native declares
 *       ∅ structure, so the guard is a no-op for it)
 *   4. current render == synced  → INGEST (records unmoved since last
 *      projection; the disk edit applies cleanly)
 *   5. both moved                → CONFLICT (surface, never overwrite —
 *      Unison's law; the CRDT diff-splice path refines this later)

 *   - `deserialize` — disk bytes → records + the fault diagnostics,
