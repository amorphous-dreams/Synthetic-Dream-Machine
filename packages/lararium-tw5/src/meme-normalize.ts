/**
 * meme-normalize — canonicalize a meme carrier's framing for round-trip stability.
 *
 * The doctrine: corpus files stay "non-canonical at rest until a deliberate
 * normalization commit" (wiki-layer-ontology; the meme-corpus-roundtrip laws).
 * A freshly-authored or lifted carrier MAY drift from canonical form; this
 * gesture homes it back so the lens laws (single-closer · content-whole ·
 * idempotent) hold — rather than loosening the gate that guards the graph.
 *
 * Classes closed here (the ones a hand-authored or lifted carrier most often trips):
 *   1. **SOH opener.** The opener canonicalizes to `<<^ code="&#x0001;" namespace="[namespace-glyphs]" `
 *      — one space after `<<^`, then the meta-declared namespace as LITERAL glyphs
 *      (or none), then the SOH char. Two drifts trip it: a missing/stale namespace
 *      (the renderer re-injects → round-trip breaks), and a missing space
 *      (`<<^ code="&#x0001;" `, the lifted-corpus form — 10 stragglers against 102 canonical
 *      siblings). The meta field is authoritative; the SOH is derived from it.
 *   2. **Sigil close spacing.** A close carrying whitespace before `>>` tightens.
 *      The reader takes both spellings; the writer emits one.
 *   3. **Child-slot roots.** A slot opens at `#/name`, nested slots carrying the
 *      whole path. Control slots take no root — they open no addressable child.
 *
 * Pure + idempotent (re-running changes nothing). The SOH grammar mirrors the deserializer's own
 * param-aware SOH scan (`deserializer.ts`).
 *
 * Meme: lar:///ha.ka.ba/lararium/tw5/meme-normalize
 */

/**
 * The whole SOH opener, up to its closing `>>`, with the namespace param captured where one stands.
 *
 * The opener carries NAMED PARAMS, so canonicalizing it means rewriting the param list rather than
 * splicing glyphs in front of a control entity. Matching the whole head lets one rebuild place the
 * namespace correctly whether the carrier states one, states a stale one, or states none at all.
 */
/**
 * The declaration a carrier opens with.
 *
 * SPELLED HERE, not imported, and the constraint is structural rather than stylistic: this module gets
 * BUNDLED INTO THE TW5 PLUGIN, so an import from the mesh package would pull that package's automerge
 * wasm into a bundle that cannot carry it. The whole file stays dependency-free for that reason.
 *
 * `type-parity` holds the two spellings together — it reads every literal declaration in the tree
 * against the one authority, so this copy cannot drift without a witness saying so.
