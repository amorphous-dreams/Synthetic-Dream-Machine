/**
 * lar-uri — read one part of an address, in the vocabulary the URI law already uses.
 *
 * ── WHY THE ADDRESS AND NOT A FIELD ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Belonging lives in the title. A child addressed `lar:///root#/a/b` is enclosed by `lar:///root#/a`,
 * and the whole relation reads from the name with no stored parent to go stale when a title moves.
 * The wiki still has to ASK, and TiddlyWiki's core here ships no `split` — that gap is the only
 * reason the relation was ever kept in a field.
 *
 * ── THE SUFFIX CARRIES THE PART ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `[lar-uri:parent[]]`, matching `toml-field` and `wikisense`: the mode rides the suffix and the
 * operand stays free for a genuine parameter. The five law-named chunks read by their own names —
 * scheme · authority · root · path · fragment — so a reader of the filter learns the law and back.
 *
 * `root` holds the LAW's sense: the three-term `w1.w2.w3` heading.angle.dynamic that opens a path.
 * An address stripped of its fragment answers to `bare`, because two meanings under one word in a
 * vocabulary claiming to mirror the law is the collision this grammar keeps finding.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS OPERATOR REFUSES, AND WHY IT MUST ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * An unregistered operator returns an EMPTY LIST in TiddlyWiki — a misspelled part reads exactly like
 * a part that found nothing. So an unknown suffix THROWS. A filter is read by an author who cannot
 * step through it, and silence is the one failure they cannot see.
 *
 * A title outside this grammar reports rather than refuses: it passes through under `parent`, and
 * reads empty under a part it does not carry. Graceful parsing is the deserializer's law and this
 * answers to it — a foreign title is not an error, it is simply not ours.

 * THE OPERATOR'S NAME IS ITS EXPORTED NAME, and this one cannot be an identifier.

 * `wikisense`, `stack` — reads as a single word and never met the rule. `lar-uri` carries a hyphen, so
 * a plain `export function larUri` registers `larUri` and the filter an author writes resolves to
 * nothing: no throw, no warning, an empty result set that reads exactly like a filter matching nothing.
 *
 * The arbitrary-string export binds the name the grammar means. Any future operator whose name carries
 * a hyphen needs this line too.
