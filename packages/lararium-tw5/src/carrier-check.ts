/**
 * carrier-check — the block check a carrier carries, computed rather than stored.
 *
 * ── WHY IT DERIVES AND NEVER SITS IN A FIELD ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A check held as a record field is a stored derivation, and a stored derivation goes stale the moment
 * the thing it derives from moves. This tree has met that five times over: a genesis manifest naming a
 * plugin two edits back, a router arm matching a shape no carrier writes, a harvester scanning for a
 * sigil that stopped rendering. Each one stayed internally consistent and described something that had
 * stopped being true, and nothing could notice because nothing recomputed.
 *
 * So the emitter computes the check over the body it has just assembled, and a reader recomputes it
 * over the bytes in front of it. Two computations of one fact, never a copy of one.
 *
 * ── THE SPAN, PER THE RECEIVED FRAMING ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A block runs `STX -> text -> ETX -> BCC`: the terminator comes first and the check follows it
 * directly (IBM BSC, 1967). The span runs from the first character of the STX sigil to the last
 * character of the ETX sigil, inclusive — so the check covers the marks that bound it and never covers
 * itself, which is what lets it sit after ETX with no self-exclusion rule.
 *
 * ── TWO ALTITUDES: HEX TRAVELS, GLYPHS RENDER ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The slot the check occupies — after ETX, before EOT — carries it in the received framing and in this
 * grammar alike, so one form serves both and the check needs no wrapper of its own.
 *
 * What the check LOOKS like splits by artifact class rather than by layer.
 *
 * A CARRIER holds the `ni:///sha-256;<base64url>` form — RFC 6920, full digest, canonical-or-reject —
 * because a carrier travels. Plain ASCII cannot be bitten by a variation selector, a zero-width joiner,
 * a skin-tone modifier or a client's own normalization, and a reader holding nothing but the file still
 * verifies it. Keeping every glyph vocabulary out of the encoding also keeps rendering REVISABLE: an
 * alphabet frozen into the bytes could never improve without invalidating every carrier ever written,
 * where an alphabet used only to render may be bettered in year three with every stamp still verifying.
 *
 * A PROJECTION carries the glyph-stamped form on disk — an FTLS Powers card, a character sheet, any
 * artifact the wiki renders for a reader rather than ships to a peer. A projection IS the rendered
 * surface, so the file on disk shows what the live wiki shows, and an operator comparing the two reads
 * one thing in both places. The at-a-glance stamp belongs where reading happens.
 *
 * Two spellings of one digest, each where it serves: the same law the house stands at every other
 * altitude — a private pet-name beside a declared Handle, `Aperture` beside `Focus`.
 *
 * ── WHAT A RELAY CAN DO WITH IT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * One lexical scan — the frame recogniser read through the fence mask, so a quoted mark never frames.
 * No grammar, no rendering, no canonicaliser: the scan reads the carrier's QUOTING, never its meaning.
 * A Herm holding `pull` and not `read` runs that scan without opening what the carrier says — the
 * relay-law exception in `ability-implies` is exactly the capability this instrument was shaped to fit.

 * memes carry worked examples of every mark inside quote fences, and a raw `indexOf` locks onto the
 * FIRST one it meets — which in those documents is an example, hundreds of lines above the body. Six
 * carriers verified that way: the reader confirmed a check written inside a teaching example and
 * reported `ok` while the carrier's own body went unexamined. The emitter never had that fault, since
 * it divides a carrier the way the deserializer does; this reader now meets it on one span.
