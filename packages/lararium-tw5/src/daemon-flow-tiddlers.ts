/**
 * daemon-flow-tiddlers — seed the pet-named FLOW tiddlers into the daemon bag.
 *
 * Each seed FLOW (crystal · rhythm · couple) lands as one tiddler addressed by its own `lar:` URI pet-name
 * (buildFlowTiddler stamps title/authority/bag). The daemon dispatcher reads them — the verb-tiddler
 * protocol — to run a flow by pet-name; the runner ALSO reads FLOW_SEEDS from code, so a vessel that never
 * seeds still runs every flow (the tiddlers make the flow-set ADDRESSABLE in the bag, not runnable).
 *
 * The capStack rides the COMPACT `instrument:hull …` list-string form parseCapStack reads back (never a JSON
 * blob in a tiddler field). Idempotent (setTiddler overwrites). Seed alongside the other daemon seeds,
 * BEFORE the projection's first render.
