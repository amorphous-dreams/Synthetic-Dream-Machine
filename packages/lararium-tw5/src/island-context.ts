/**
 * island-context — shared IslandContext and IslandBehavior types.
 *
 * These types hold identical structure on all platforms (Node worker_threads,
 * browser Web Workers, future WASM/UE5 runtimes). The sovereign island kernel
 * on each platform constructs and passes this context; behaviors depend only
 * on this contract, never on platform-specific APIs.
 *
 * Lives in @lararium/tw5 because TW5Engine is the only non-mesh import —
 * placing it here avoids a circular dependency while keeping it isomorphic.
 *
 * Island Sovereignty Law §9: TW5 SHALL NOT instantiate on the main thread.
 * Every TW5Engine lives inside a sovereign Worker. Behaviors therefore always
 * receive this context from within a Worker — never from a main-thread caller.
