/**
 * circle-verbs — the FOLLOW-GRAPH daemon verbs over the sovereign circles doc.
 *
 * "Adding to a circle IS the follow" (social-seed). The follow-graph's SOURCE OF TRUTH rides the circles
 * Automerge bag — a PER-NYM CRDT-set on each circle tiddler — a PRIVATE bag the self-slot FLEET-syncs
 * same-operator (so a follow lands on ALL the operator's own devices, matching the catalog registry) and the
 * DeterministicFederationGate NEVER volunteers to a cross-operator (the circles doc sits OUTSIDE its federatable set).
 * One graph, every device of the one human, no stranger — "the only surface human eyes have on the crypto
 * layer" for friends + wanderers.
 *
 * THE PER-NYM CRDT-SET (no whole-field clobber). Membership rides as INDIVIDUAL per-nym fields, never one
 * space-joined `memberDids` register: a follow stamps `mbr+:<nym>` = now, an unfollow stamps `mbr-:<nym>` = now.
 * A nym reads PRESENT iff it carries an add stamp AND no remove stamp strictly supersedes it (remove-WINS on a
 * tie). Because a concurrent follow and unfollow touch DIFFERENT keys (add vs remove of the SAME nym) — and two
 * follows of DIFFERENT nyms touch different keys entirely — the Automerge field-merge keeps BOTH edits: no add
 * a fleet-mate made off-device is ever lost to a whole-field last-writer-wins. The `memberDids` register is
 * GONE — cold-boot-ceremony and social-seed stamp `mbr+:` directly now (alpha line, no back-compat); a doc
 * from before that move holds no member this reader could still find anyway, so there is nothing left to fold.
 *
 * These reactors run IN the daemon worker (verify-then-delegate gated), reaching the circles doc by ACCESS (the
 * catalog registry names it) and writing-then-syncing — access≠load, never a mounted render layer. A follow
 * writes ONLY the circles doc; NO crossroads plane / board / announce shore is reachable here, so the graph never federates
 * by SHAPE. The ONE federated surface stays the glamour a human DELIBERATELY publishes — a separate act.
 *
 * The recognition layer (the handle-book: others' nyms + private petnames) stays LOCAL for now — a follow of
 * an unknown nym fails-closed CLIENT-side (composeFollow) BEFORE the membership write reaches this verb. The
 * handle-book + petname co-move onto the circles doc is the operator-named fork (see the handback finding).
