/**
 * cabal-realm-verbs — FEED a realm, and READ who feeds it, over the sovereign daemon doc.
 *
 * A cabal-realm lives by being fed. Members roll a per-realm LEASE EPOCH — one slot per writer under the
 * daemon bag — and the realm's liveness reads off that max-register. `realm-feed` rolls this writer's own
 * slot (the offering); `realm-clock` reads every slot back and reports who feeds and how deep.
 *
 * ONE WRITER, ONE SLOT. A writer touches only the slot it owns, so two members feeding concurrently never
 * clobber each other and the effective epoch never moves backward. That is the whole reason the lease rides a
 * slot-map rather than a scalar: a bare counter would let a concurrent write DROP a higher value, un-staling
 * grants the roll was meant to stale.
 *
 * THE CLOCK SURFACES, IT NEVER JUDGES. `realm-clock` hands back per-maintainer standing, the spread, and the
 * leading-set size as raw numbers, and emits no "captured" verdict — what spread counts as capture stays the
 * operator's calibration, and mechanizing it here would recreate the root the realm exists without. It also
 * reports a LOCAL SIGHTING: a maintainer whose roll has not synced reads as absent, and a realm nobody here
 * has synced reads as unfed. Under no-global-now those two generate identically.
 *
 * WHOSE HAND FEEDS. The writer rides as the face's leaf key at the realm's Nexus — a FACE feeds a realm, not a
 * device, so adding vessels never inflates a standing. The feed binds that writer to the presenter through the
 * face→leaf bond (`face-leaf-bond`): the presenting face's atom and the leaf both signed one image naming this realm,
 * so a face feeds as its own leaf and no other. Only an ask that arrived local (a session, the vessel's own channel)
 * presents a face here; a synced summons names a presenter it cannot back, so it feeds nothing. A human running
 * several of their own faces at one realm reads as the Sybil-of-one the plane already prices socially, never in crypto.
