/**
 * diagnostics — the meme-ast recovery record, read onto the core TW5 parse-diagnostics contract.
 *
 * The driver already recovers span-keyed and out-of-band (`ParseFailure`). Core TiddlyWiki now
 * closes over the same shape for any grammar: `{from, to, severity, source, code, message}` with
 * severity drawn from `error | warning | info | hint`, read by `[parse-diagnostics[]]` through the
 * parse cache. Mapping one onto the other lets the wiki, the filter, the render plane and the
 * ingest gate read a single channel rather than three private ones.
 *
 * Pure and isomorphic: no `$tw`, so the gate imports it without dragging the VM in.
