/**
 * worldline-read-vm — TW5 startup module: the IN-VM worldline reads (the permainan substrate, the
 * flow-lens foundation), homed in the sovereign daemon worker.
 *
 * The reads live in this island VM, off the node coordinator,
 * under strict sovereign-worker primacy — the cap-stack lifts WHOLE, no coordinator carve-out. The
 * worker holds the LIVE ITC registry and runs every read's COMPUTE; the host ships only external data
 * (edges derived from a transcript, form-vector bytes from the python form store the worker can't
 * reach), exactly as the recall query-derive (`query-derive-vm`) ships its query string IN. This is
 * the worldline twin of that derive module — same one-runtime lock, same pure-subpath idiom.
 *
 * Three wells, two reads:
 *   Well 1 (the TIME axis) — `worldlineCompareVm({ a, b, opens, closes, root })` projects the
 *     WorldlineCausal registry from the carried edge-DAG (worldlineCausalFromEdges), HOLDS it in
 *     module state (so a future read→filter-compute chain can read it), then answers the
 *     concurrent-capable causal verdict (before / after / concurrent / equal) the rhythmic clock
 *     can never give. An unknown handle THROWS (the host surfaces the helpful error).
 *   Well 3 (the CORE) + Well 4 (NULL-READY) — `worldlineTrajectoryVm({ handle, stubs, joinForm,
 *     includeNull, seed, window })` runs the pure Turn→Trajectory functor (orderTrajectory) over the
 *     handle's captured turns, joins each turn's move-space position from the form-vectors the host
 *     shipped (joinFormVectors — a miss leaves a null slot, never drops a turn), and optionally rides
 *     the SAME path through the seeded `shuffleTrajectory` null baseline.
 *
 * ## The temp-tids / TW5-filter pattern (FLAGGED, not built — the enabling design)
 *
 * The operator's vision: a future `lares` CLI read → TW5-filter-compute-on-temp-tids chain, the whole
 * stack lifting in-VM. The clean alignment with THIS module: instead of the JS reads below, write the
 * edge-DAG + the captured turns as TEMP TIDDLERS into the daemon wikistore (titles like
 * `$:/temp/worldline/edge/<n>` and `$:/temp/worldline/turn/<sha>`), then compute compare/trajectory
 * with TW5 filter language over them — so a CLI read could land rows as temp tids and a filter
 * pipeline could chain straight on. Why FLAGGED, not built here: the ITC partial-order (compare) and
 * the happened-before ordering (trajectory) do not map onto stock TW5 filter operators — they'd need
 * two CUSTOM filter operators (`worldline-compare[<a>,<b>]` and `worldline-order[<handle>]`, each a
 * `filteroperator` module reading the temp tids and calling these SAME pure libs), plus a temp-tid
 * writer and a teardown sweep. That is a larger reshaping; the operator's brief sanctions homing the
 * JS reads in the VM module NOW (done) and flagging the temp-tids pattern with this concrete sketch.
 * When that lands, these pure `computeWorldline*` functions become the filter operators' kernel — the
 * compute already lives in-VM, so the move is additive (a tid projection + 2 filter ops), never a
 * second migration.
 *
 * PURE subpath (no Automerge) — the barrel `@lararium/mesh` drags in wasm the plugin build can't bundle.
