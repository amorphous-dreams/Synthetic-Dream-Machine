/**
 * persona-selves — the FLEET-riding half of a human's own-persona names, as a per-field CRDT.
 *
 * The pet-name and the declared Handle name a human's own faces TO THEMSELVES and to their own devices. A
 * label a human sets on one vessel and loses on the next names the compartment badly, so both ride the
 * persona bag — the PersonaGroup's own private plane, which the self-slot FLEET-syncs same-operator and the
 * DeterministicFederationGate never volunteers to a cross-operator. One multitude, every device of the one
 * human, no stranger.
 *
 * WHAT DOES NOT RIDE. The `seat` claim stays LOCAL to the node that holds it: a Kahu chair names a seat on a
 * PARTICULAR node, so syncing it would let one device seat a persona on another device's seal. The fleet
 * carries what a persona IS called; each node keeps what it stands for HERE.
 *
 * THE PER-FIELD STAMP (no whole-record clobber). Each name carries its own value+stamp pair — `petname` beside
 * `petname@`, `handle` beside `handle@`. A rename on one vessel writes only that field's pair, so a concurrent
 * rename of a DIFFERENT persona, or of the OTHER name on the same persona, touches different keys entirely and
 * the Automerge field-merge keeps both. Where two devices renamed the SAME field concurrently, the later stamp
 * reads — a last-writer-wins the human can see and correct, never a silently dropped edit.
 *
 * NO CLOCK AUTHORITY. The stamp orders concurrent edits and settles nothing else: two vessels of one human
 * carry no shared now (causal-islands), so a stamp reads as an ordering hint the human may overrule by
 * renaming again. Nothing gates on it, and no reader treats it as a time.
