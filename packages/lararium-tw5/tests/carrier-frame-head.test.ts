/**
 * A carrier frame rides the CONTROL head — and the corpus says so, 556 files to zero.
 *
 * The sigil sets split into capability domains: the frame took `<<^`, every word sigil kept `<<~`. So the
 * head now CARRIES the distinction rather than decorating it, and a frame on the speaking head names a
 * malformed carrier rather than an older one — there is no older one to be compatible with.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS TEST EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Detection kept matching the speaking head after the split, and 554 of 555 framed memes stopped reading
 * as carriers. NOTHING failed: a carrier that misses detection routes down the registry path instead of
 * the direct memetic one, so the vessel comes up and the memes arrive wrong. A silent misroute at seed
 * time is the worst shape a break can take, and a green suite reported it as fine because no test ever
 * met a real swept meme.
 *
 * The property pinned here is the one that survives any future head-change: the frame's head is LAW, and
 * a test asserts it against the same spelling the handler uses.
