   * raises the count without anything having broken — the edges it surfaces dangled all along, unread.
   * A rise is only allowed to be absorbed here for the second reason, and only with the cause named;
   * absorbing the first one silently is how a ceiling stops measuring anything.
   *
   * TWO READERS, TWO CORPORA: `lares meme check --edges $(git ls-files 'bags/*.mem')` reads 175 over bags/
   * alone; this test walks `carrierFiles` — every declared carrier, tiddlers and memory included — and
   * reads 178. The ceiling here is THIS reader's number; lowering it to the CLI's would red on the three
   * edges the CLI never sees, which the runtime kernel face at
   * packages/lararium-tw5/tiddlers/memetic-wikitext.tid carries (`…/api/pono/invariant`,
