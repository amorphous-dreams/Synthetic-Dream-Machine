   * TWO REASONS THE CEILING RISES, AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME ACT. A rename that orphans a target is a
   * corpus break, and the repair is to the corpus. A reader that learns to see a form it was blind to
   * raises the count without anything having broken — the edges it surfaces dangled all along, unread.
   * A rise is only allowed to be absorbed here for the second reason, and only with the cause named;
   * absorbing the first one silently is how a ceiling stops measuring anything.
   *
   * 196 → 198, and the cause is the SECOND kind. The corpus finder learned to read the DECLARATION
   * rather than a `bags/**` path, and the runtime kernel face at
   * packages/lararium-tw5/tiddlers/memetic-wikitext.tid entered a corpus no reader had ever walked.
   * Its four edges — three at `…/api/pono/invariant`, one at `lararium-node/MEME-STORE-FOUNDATIONS` —
   * pointed at nothing before this test could see them, and two of them are offset by the uri-paths
   * that same carrier now holds. Nothing broke; a blind spot closed.
