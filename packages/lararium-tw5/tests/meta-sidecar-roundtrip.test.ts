/**
 * meta-sidecar-roundtrip — a content filetype keeps its fields across a body edit.
 *
 * The projector writes a `.md`/content carrier as `<body>` + a `.meta` sidecar
 * (fields). On re-ingest the island parses the sidecar (TW5's own field parser)
 * and seeds the deserialize, so the landed record recovers type/tags/custom
 * fields even when only the body file changed — no field loss.
 *
 * The same floor the carrier grammar answers to applies here, one filetype over: a field an operator can
 * SEE on a tiddler must survive being edited, projected, and read back. A native file splits that journey
 * across two artifacts instead of one, which gives a field two ways to fall out rather than none.
