/**
 * ahu-sections-address — every named `ahu` section becomes an addressable tiddler.
 *
 * A meme splits into one tiddler per `<<~ ahu #name>>` child, and the section's address
 * (`lar:///<uri-path>#name`) resolves to that tiddler. That is the whole premise of a fragment in a
 * `lar:` URI: the name points at a thing.
 *
 * NO OTHER INSTRUMENT SEES THIS. The block check verifies bytes and passes; round-trip verifies that a
 * carrier re-renders to what the wiki parsed and passes; the frame witness checks that marks are
 * declared and passes. All three stay green on a carrier whose sections collapsed into its root — the
 * bytes are intact, the render is faithful, and the names point at nothing.
 *
 * The two tests below split the fault by cause:
 *
 *   ① EVERY OPEN CLOSES.        A `<<~ ahu #x>>` with no `<<~/ahu>>` swallows the sections that
 *                               follow it, so they never open a tiddler of their own.
 *
 *                               A NESTED section is not that fault. Nesting is deliberate house
 *                               structure — an OODA-HA phase carries its ha/ka/ba triple — and it
 *                               addresses under a ROOTED path, `#/observe/observe-ha`. ② reads
 *                               the LEAF, so a nest passes and a swallowed section fails.
 *   ② EVERY OPEN ADDRESSES.     The stronger claim, and the one that catches the rest: whatever the
 *                               cause, an opened section resolves to a tiddler.
 *
 * ① is a subset of ②'s failures. Both run because a balance fault and an addressing fault want
 * different repairs, and a single red would hide which one a carrier has.
