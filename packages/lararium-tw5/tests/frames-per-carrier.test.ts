/**
 * frames-per-carrier — how many bodies a carrier holds, counted the way the PARSER counts.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `checkSpan` finds a file's FIRST `STX -> ETX` and stops, so `verifyBcc` answers for one body and
 * `bcc-witness` reports one verdict per file. That reading holds exactly as long as a carrier holds
 * one body, and this file is what asks.
 *
 * A grep cannot ask it. This grammar TEACHES its own control set, so the specification memes carry
 * worked examples of every mark inside quote fences — one-tick inline, three- and four-tick blocks.
 * A pattern without a fence mask reads each of those as a live frame and reports the document that
 * defines the check as a document whose second body goes unchecked. Two hand-counts did exactly that
 * before this file existed, one of them off by half.
 *
 * So the count imports `maskedExecAll` — the parser's own mask, the same reader the deserializer uses
 * to divide a carrier — and a teaching example stays a teaching example.

   * Every corpus walk in this package opens the same way: read `uri-path`, and `continue` where a
   * carrier declares none. That skip reads as reasonable — an unnamed carrier addresses no meme, so a
   * round-trip has nothing to render it back TO — and it means a green corpus run says nothing at all
   * about the carriers it stepped over.
   *
   * The cost is not theoretical. Two carriers gained a `uri-path` in an earlier pass and immediately
   * failed the corpus round-trip, and the failure read as damage the naming had caused. It was not.
   * They had never passed; they had never been LOOKED AT, and being named is what put them in front of
   * the reader for the first time.
   *
   * So the skip gets counted rather than left implicit. The count was a ceiling of 17 while the reason
   * for each was unknown; every one of those has since been named or retired, and what remains is a
   * KIND rather than a residue: a bag declares itself and holds no meme's text, so it carries no
   * `uri-path` and never should.
   *
   * The reading tightens to match. Not "no more than N go unwalked", but "every file a corpus walk
   * skips is a bag declaring itself" — an invariant a new gap breaks, where a ceiling would have
   * absorbed it silently.
