/**
 * grammar-in-a-wiki — every grammar claim measured inside a live TW5 instance.
 *
 * ── ONE PARSER HOLDS THE TRUTH, AND IT RUNS INSIDE A WIKI ───────────────────────────────────────
 * A sigil's meaning lives in the tiddler that defines it; a procedure resolves through the host's own
 * dispatcher; a name that binds nothing renders as its own text. None of that is available to a reader
 * standing outside a wiki — so a grammar claim measured outside one measures a reader the system does
 * not trust, and a green run there proves only that the untrusted reader agrees with itself.
 *
 * ── MIRRORED FROM THE HOST'S OWN TEST EDITION ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * TiddlyWiki tests its own grammar exactly this way. `editions/test/quick-test.js` boots `$tw` from
 * `boot/boot.js`, disables the startup modules a test does not need, and every spec parses through
 * `wiki.parseText(type, text)` on a wiki that stands; the specs are tiddlers, the wiki is the
 * instrument, and nothing parses in the runner itself.
 *
 * This mirrors that shape: ONE engine for the file, booted once in `beforeAll`, and every claim below
 * asked of `wiki.deserializeTiddlers` or `wiki.parseText` — the same two doors the host's specs use.
 *
 * A HARNESS OUTSIDE THE RUNNER DOES NOT WORK, and the reason is worth recording: booting the vendored
 * core from a bare node script throws `$tw.preloadTiddlerArray is not a function`, because the engine
 * seeds its globals through the environment the runner provides. The mirror is the runner, not a
 * standalone script — which is what TiddlyWiki does too.
 *
 * ── WHAT STAYS OUTSIDE, AND WHY IT IS NOT AN EXCEPTION ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * The boot loader (`lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/api/pono/boot-loader`) reads before a wiki exists: four frame
 * marks, one identity fence, one worksite boundary, nothing else. Its conformance CANNOT be tested in a
 * wiki, because the question only means anything before one stands.
