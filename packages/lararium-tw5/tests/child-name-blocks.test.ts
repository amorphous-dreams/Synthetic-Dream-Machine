/**
 * child-name-blocks — the operator's names, at the grain where a fragment declares them.
 *
 * A carrier's own meta block is compared corpus-wide; a CHILD's is not, and cannot be: the emitter
 * writes a child block only where the child DIFFERS from its parent, and no carrier on disk currently
 * does. Every real child block this grammar will ever write gets written for the first time in a live
 * wiki, so the laws that govern it hold here or nowhere.
 *
 * Two laws meet on a fragment:
 *
 *   · `CHILD_META_DENY` extends `META_DENY` with the two DERIVED coordinates (`uri-path`, `file-path`) —
 *     a fragment's address follows from its parent and its slot, so re-stating it invites the two to
 *     disagree.
 *   · the grammar's carriage rides `$…`, which means an author may name a field `postamble` or `slot`
 *     on a fragment exactly as on a carrier. That freedom is worth a gate: the names were reserved for
 *     long enough that a future reader could re-reserve one without noticing what it costs.
 *
 * The meta-parity gate reads only the FIRST block in a file, so nothing below the parent's declaration
 * has ever been measured. This is that measurement, taken where the blocks actually exist.
