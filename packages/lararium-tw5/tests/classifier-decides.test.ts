/**
 * A control sigil identifies by its CLASSIFIER, never by which head carries it.
 *
 * WHY THIS TEST EXISTS, AND WHAT IT LEARNED FROM. Splitting the sigil sets gave the frame sigils a control
 * head while every word sigil kept the speaking one. A carrier detector that matched the speaking head
 * alone then stopped seeing 554 of 555 framed memes — and NOTHING FAILED. A carrier that fails detection
 * routes down a different path, so the vessel comes up and the memes arrive wrong; a green suite reported
 * it fine because no test read detection against a swept meme.
 *
 * The cure generalises past the one detector: **every** control matcher stays indifferent to the head, so
 * a future head change cannot repeat this quietly in whichever matcher nobody re-read. This test walks the
 * matchers off SOURCE rather than from a list — a hand-kept roster would drift from the thing it names,
 * and drift is precisely the failure mode here.

   * pinning one head goes blind the day a head moves. That held while both heads were live. The frame
   * has since locked to `<<^`, and the argument inverts — a matcher still admitting `<<~` accepts a
   * malformed carrier in SILENCE, which is the same blindness aimed the other way and worse here,
   * because an unmatched frame reroutes to text rather than throwing.
   *
   * The corpus has already moved: one carrier holds the old form and the fence mask shows it quoted,
   * a teaching example rather than a frame. The matchers have not. This test names the ones left.
   *
   * Two of them are not leftovers and want reading before they move — `ANY_OPEN_RE` matches ANY sigil
   * open by design, and the deserializer's namespace/SOH-code reads take a head's PARAMS rather than
   * assert its glyph. Whichever survives review earns an exemption written where it stands.
