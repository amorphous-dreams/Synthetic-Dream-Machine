/**
 * A meme's status flag says what its own prose already says, or it says nothing at all.
 *
 * WHY THIS GUARD EXISTS. Twelve implementation memes carried one flag — "proposed" — across states that
 * differ completely: a design ledger with no code, a core built and revert-verified with one shore left
 * unlit, and a rite a person ENACTS where "built" is not a question that applies. The prose in each was
 * precise; the field had gone flat, so a reader scanning flags learned nothing and a reader trusting them
 * learned wrong.
 *
 * THREE STATES, DERIVED RATHER THAN IMPOSED — each read off what those twelve said about themselves:
 *   · designed — a ruling or design stands; no code stands behind it
 *   · standing — a substrate or core is built and live; any unlit shore is named in the meme's own prose
 *   · rite     — a procedure a person enacts, where build-state is not a property it could have
 *
 * AND EVERY FLAG CARRIES ITS REASON. `status-why` sits beside it so the field cannot drift from the prose
 * again without the drift being visible — a flag alone is exactly what went flat the first time.
 *
 * NINE WORDS COLLAPSED TO THREE, AND THE COLLAPSE IS THE POINT. Writing this guard surfaced that the
 * field was never flat so much as FRAGMENTED — approved, canon, draft, working-draft, enacting, active
 * and proposed all rode it, drifted in independently, and answered different questions at once:
 * has-it-been-ratified, how-finished-is-the-writing, is-something-in-motion. A reader had to know which
 * question a given word was answering before the answer meant anything.
 *
 * One axis now, the one a reader actually needs: WHAT MAY I RELY ON HERE. And every flag carries its
 * REASON beside it, so a wrong call stays findable rather than laundered into a bare word.
 *
 * SCOPE: the whole memegraph, both bags. The pono canon and the implementation bag answer the same
 * question about their own subjects, so they answer it in the same words.
