/**
 * The control band opens with the caret, everywhere, and the corpus proves it.
 *
 * WHY A GUARD AND NOT JUST A SWEEP. Turning every carrier was a one-time act; nothing about it stops a
 * hand-written `<<~ &#x0002;>>` arriving next week from a stale template, a copied fixture, or a memory
 * of the older form. A sweep fixes a corpus once. A guard keeps it fixed — and it reads the corpus off
 * disk rather than from a list, so a carrier added tomorrow gets checked without anyone remembering to
 * add it.
 *
 * WHY THE MARK MATTERS. The carrier grammar decides three constructs on the THIRD character with no
 * lookahead: `<<~` speaks, `<<^` frames, `<<<` quotes, anything else calls a macro. Put the control band
 * back on the sharktooth and the framing becomes indistinguishable from a verb; move it into an entity
 * (`<<&#x0001;`) and it lands inside the macrocall token. The caret is what keeps one character deciding.
