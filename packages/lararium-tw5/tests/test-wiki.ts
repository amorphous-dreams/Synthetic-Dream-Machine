/**
 * test-wiki — one door to a booted TiddlyWiki, for every suite that asks the wiki rather than a module.
 *
 * ── WHY ONE DOOR ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The suites that ask a real wiki each re-derived the same three things: where the vendored core blob
 * sits, what to do when it is absent, and which plugins the grammar needs. Three facts in six
 * spellings drift the way every such set drifts — a plugin added to five of them reads correct in each
 * file while the sixth quietly tests an older grammar.
 *
 * WHAT A SUITE CALLS DECIDES, never what it constructs. Six ask a wiki to answer — three through
 * `exportCarrierFile`, one through `$tw.wiki.deserializeTiddlers`, one across two describes of its own,
 * and `wiki-sense-vm` through a boot it keeps, since the PACKED ARTIFACT is what that suite witnesses
 * and a door loading the source JSON would test away the drift it watches for.
 *
 * Constructing a `TW5Engine` does NOT make a suite one of them. `vm-grammar-boundary` builds an engine
 * and never boots it, driving a fake wiki to prove the host delegates decomposition to the VM rather
 * than deciding it — the engine there is a stand-in, and routing it through this door would replace the
 * fake it exists to hold. A suite belongs here when it needs a wiki to ANSWER, not to exist.
 *
 * The SKIP is the half worth naming. The core blob is a gitignored build artifact, so a fresh clone —
 * and CI's `test` job, which runs `pnpm -r test` with no build step — sees it absent. An anonymous
 * `skipIf` there drops a suite at exit 0, indistinguishable from a green run. Every skip this helper
 * hands back names itself and its cure in the reporter line.
 *
 * ── DRIVEN FROM OUTSIDE THE LIVE VESSEL ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This stands its own engine and never reaches for a running daemon. A suite that asked the live
 * vessel would measure whatever that vessel happens to hold — its bags, its edits, its uptime — and
 * report the operator's state as the grammar's behaviour. The wiki here boots from the same core and
 * plugins a vessel does and holds nothing else, so what a test reads, the grammar put there.
