## Save Cascade Law

The save cascade is the write-routing constitution for `LarariumCrdtSyncAdaptor`.
When TW5 fires `saveTiddler(tiddler)`, the adaptor resolves a `SaveStrategy` for the tiddler title by walking these rules in `order` — first match wins.

Two strategies exist:
- `skip` — do not propagate to the shared Automerge store (session-local scratch: `$:/temp/*`, TW5 system internals)
- `direct` — write one `LarTiddlerRecord` per tiddler to the store; ahu slot children write as independent records alongside their parent

Draft tiddlers (`Draft of ...`) use `direct` — they are identity-scoped, not session-scoped. A user's in-progress edit syncs across their devices.

The cascade is read at runtime from the wiki via:
```
[tag[lar:///ha.ka.ba/@lararium/tw5/sync/save-cascade]has[tw5-filter]sort[order]]
```
Each tagged child tiddler contributes one rule via its `tw5-filter` and `save-strategy` fields.
