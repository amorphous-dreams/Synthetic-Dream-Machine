// FOUR MECHANISMS DISPATCH ON THIS STRING, each a different one: the TW5 parser module exports under
// it, the deserializer module exports under it, `registerFileType` binds `.mem` to it, and a stored
// `type` field is compared against it. A fifth reads it back off disk from a carrier's own meta block.
//
// They agree only by hand, and the failure is silent in the worst way: a record whose type no reader
// admits simply stops projecting. No throw, no diagnostic, no file — the carrier is just absent from
// the next disk pass, and the diff reads as though nobody edited it.
//
// So `carrier-type.ts` holds the declaration and this witness checks that nothing spells it inline.
// A LITERAL IS THE FAULT, not a mismatch — by the time two literals disagree the damage has landed.

// spells it inline out of necessity: `meme-normalize` gets bundled into the TW5 plugin, so an import
// from the mesh package would drag that package's automerge wasm into a bundle that cannot hold it.
