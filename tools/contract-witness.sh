# contract-witness — the operator handshake across TWO vessels that share no key.
#
# ── WHAT A ONE-VESSEL WALK CANNOT SEE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Walking movement ⑦ on one hearth runs both halves of the handshake there, so the joiner's
# contract-in gets signed by a persona that same vessel holds. Every byte verifies, and the one property
# the whole ceremony exists for goes unmeasured: that a Nexus admits a key it has NEVER HELD.
#
# So this stands two roots. Vessel A founds a Nexus and seats its quorum. Vessel B founds independently —
# its own device key, its own persona roots, its own vault passphrase — and A holds no seed of B's. The
# handshake then has to cross a real custody boundary, which is the only boundary this ceremony defends.
#
# ── THE PREREQUISITE THE ONE-VESSEL RUN HID ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# `nexus accept-carriage` reads the roster from the JOINER'S OWN seal home, because a contract-in binds to
# the charter epoch it consents under. On one vessel that read is invisible — one seal home serves both
# hands. Across two it becomes a step somebody has to perform: B cannot consent to a Nexus whose charter
# it has never seen. This harness carries A's `founding-roster.mem` to B by hand and SAYS that it did,
# because a witness that quietly satisfies a prerequisite has measured a system that does not exist.
#
# The charter carries public material only — seated verifying keys, threshold, epoch lineage. Holding it
# lets B name the epoch it consents under; it grants B no quorum, since B holds no kahu signing key.
#
# ── WHAT STAYS UNMEASURED, NAMED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Both vessels sit on one filesystem, and the two artifacts move by `cp`. That matches the CLI's own
# instruction — `hand this to a founding kahu` — so the token IS an out-of-band bearer artifact by design.
# What this does not walk is a NETWORK carry, nor two machines with two clocks. `herm-mesh-witness` and
# the container harness cover the wire; this one covers CUSTODY.
#
# Exit 0 = the door opened for a foreign key, refused three forgeries, and closed by supersession.
