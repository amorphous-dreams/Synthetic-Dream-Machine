# mesh-coverage-witness — every reachable mesh state has a scenario, or is declared unreachable.
#
# ⚠ IT READS CLAIMS, NEVER PASSES. A `# COVERS:` line says a scenario MEANS to walk a cell; whether the
# walk stands green is what running the scenario answers. Measured the hard way: four ladder steps
# claimed their cells while carrying a realm id outside 0-9a-f, so the verb refused at usage on every
# run and this witness still reported the cells walked. Read it beside a green run, never instead of one.
#
# ── WHY THE MATRIX IS DERIVED AND NOT WRITTEN ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
# This tree's own record names the failure six times: a hand-written enumeration cannot notice what
# it missed. A scenario list maintained by hand drifts the moment the code grows a state, and drifts
# SILENTLY — every listed scenario still passes, so nothing reports the hole.
#
# So the axes come from the code's own unions. `federationPosture`, `nexusPhase` and `realmStanding`
# each declare their states in one place, this reads them there, and a new state appears in the
# matrix the day it is added rather than the day somebody remembers.
#
# ── AND THE AXIS LIST IS ITSELF HAND-WRITTEN ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A new STATE on an existing axis appears here on its own. A new DIMENSION does not: the three
# `union(...)` calls below are chosen by hand, so this reports 18/18 green while whole dimensions sit
# unmeasured. That is the same failure one level up, and naming it here is cheaper than rediscovering
# it from a green run.
#
# WHAT THESE AXES DO NOT REACH, measured: every cell holds ONE cabal (the harness carries a single
# `REALM=`), one principal class (every vessel a full-caps founder or joiner — never an independent
# operator running a node without caps on the base grammar), one cap tier, and one crossing direction.
# Those are TOPOLOGY, not vessel state, so they do not belong on these axes — they want an instrument
# beside this one. A Nexus is defined by many cabals sharing hardware, and nothing here varies that.
#
# ── WHAT A SCENARIO CLAIMS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Each scenario in `mesh-scenarios.sh` declares the cell it walks with a `# COVERS:` line. The
# witness compares claims against the derived space and reports what nothing claims.
#
# UNREACHABLE CELLS ARE DECLARED, NEVER SILENTLY SKIPPED — the same idiom `surface-parity` uses for
# its exemptions: a reason that prints every run, where the next reader meets it, rather than an
# absence somebody has to rediscover.
#
# ── AND IT STANDS OUTSIDE `witness-all`, DELIBERATELY ───────────────────────────────────────────
# Ten cells are UNBUILT rather than unreachable, so this exits non-zero today. Folding that into the
# suite would leave a permanently-red witness, and this house names that failure explicitly: "a
# permanently-red witness trains a reader to skip it." Declaring the gap exempt would be the other
# half of the same failure — a silent allow-list nobody audits.
#
# So it runs on its own and prints the work list. It joins `witness-all` the day the list empties,
# and it is the thing that will say when.
