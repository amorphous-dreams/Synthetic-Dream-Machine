#
# ── WHY THE RITE NEEDS AN INSTRUMENT AND NOT A READER ───────────────────────────────────────────
# The founding runbook is the OPERATOR-INSTRUCTION SOURCE: a human or an agent resolves the next
# command from it, once, on the night a hearth becomes permanent. A stale command there fails at the
# worst moment a command can fail — mid-rite, with the vault sealed.
#
# And it drifts silently. Nothing in a CLI refactor reaches a prose document, so the rite keeps reading
# fluently while naming verbs that do not answer.
#
# So the reading is derived rather than trusted:
#   · every FIRST word must appear in the live `lares help` projection
#   · every SUB-DOOR must appear in its command module's dispatch
#
# It reads the BUILT binary, never the source — the same discipline the surface-parity witness keeps,
# because a typecheck agrees with itself while a stale sibling dist ships a door that cannot load.
#
# NOTHING IS EXECUTED. The rite includes founding procedures; a witness that ran what it checks
# would burn the operator's hearth to prove the command exists.
#
# Exit 0 = every instructed command resolves.

# ── A SUB-DOOR READS AT A DISPATCH POSITION, NEVER AS A LOOSE STRING ────────────────────────────
# Three shapes carry every dispatch in this CLI, and the VALUE side is half of each:
#   · a `switch` case                         — `case "seal":`
#   · a dispatch-map entry                    — `found: { summary … }` · `refresh: cmdRiteRefresh`
#   · a comparison against the sub-door name  — `if (sub !== "sign")`
#
# Matching a quoted literal ANYWHERE in the module is what a substring test does, and it passes on the
# very line that disproves it: `case "contract": return await cmdContract(args, "admit")` carries the
# word `admit` as an ARGUMENT, so a rite instructing `lares nexus admit` read GREEN against a door that
# answers `unknown verb "admit"`.
#
# The value side matters just as much when COUNTING. `emit()` payloads write `data:`, `human:` and
# `error:` in every module alive, so a key-shaped match with no value test reports the CLI's object
# vocabulary and calls it a surface — 220 verbs where the doors answer far fewer. Requiring a handler
# or a dispatch record on the right of the colon is what keeps the figure a reading rather than a proxy.

# ghost door through that the substring test did.
