#
# ── WHY A RANGE COSTS SAFETY IN A MESH ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# `^1.2.3` means "whatever 1.x npm serves the day someone installs." Two vessels founded a week apart
# from the same manifest then hold different bytes, and neither can say so — the manifest reads
# identical on both. For a local-first mesh standing a semi-permanent vessel, that is a divergence
# with no witness, which is the one kind this house refuses.
#
# It also erases an act. A dependency bump here is a NAMED motion — `vessel rite rebuild` exists as the
# identity-safe cure for exactly that skew — and a range performs that motion by itself, unrecorded,
# between two runs of a command nobody re-typed.
#
# So the version lives in the manifest, and a bump is a commit. `pnpm up` still moves them; it moves
# them where a reader can see it.
#
# EXEMPT: `workspace:` / `link:` / `file:` — those name a PLACE in this repo, never a version to
# resolve. Submodules (TiddlyWiki5, mempalace) carry their own upstream discipline and are not ours
# to rule.
#
# Exit 0 = every declared dependency is exact.
