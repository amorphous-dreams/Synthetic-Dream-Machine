# rehearse-founding — the REHEARSAL branch of the founding rite, run as a repeatable cycle.
#
# The rite forks (founding-runbook#the-rite): a KEEPER founding runs once, irreversibly, on the real
# hearth; a REHEARSAL founding runs in containers, disposably, as many times as it takes. This script
# stands the rehearsal branch, and the burn IS the clear — where the keeper branch opens on `rm -rf`,
# this one opens on a command whose whole virtue reads repeatable.
#
#   BURN → FOUND → WITNESS carry → WITNESS partition → BURN,  × CYCLES
#
# Each container mints its OWN identity in-container (tools/lararium-container-boot.sh → `lares vessel found`),
# so every cycle founds genuinely fresh sovereign hearths — never a restored snapshot of a prior run.
#
# WHAT A CYCLE WITNESSES (each by exit code, no metaphysics):
#   · FOUND      three vessels found from void and serve — a full Lararium + two Herm crossroads.
#   · CARRY      the source Herm's announced dial crosses source → relay-1 → relay-2, DECODED and
#                signature-verified at each hop (herm-mesh-witness.mjs — a plaintext grep of the
#                Automerge-saved snapshot could never match, so the witness reads through a real client).
#   · PARTITION  the harness CUTS relay-1. relay-2's only configured peer dies, yet its pointer ADVANCES
#                while still carrying the dial — proving it learned the source's endpoint from the
#                carried dial and now pulls DIRECTLY. Federation rides carried dials, never a
#                hardcoded peer list. Then relay-1 returns and the mesh restores.
#
# WHAT A CYCLE DOES NOT WITNESS — stated so a green run never reads as more than it proves:
#   · two OS hosts (this runs containers on one kernel, one clock, one disk).
#   · the browser vessel, the secure-context wall, or any glass surface.
#   · remote @cad CAS transit to a holder outside this process tree (#83 stays field-open).
#   · bilateral genesis between two operator-sovereign hearths signing each other in.
#   · a CONTRACTED founding (a vessel standing under a root it does not hold).
#
# THE RUN AMENDS THE RITE, never the reverse. Where a cycle contradicts a movement in
# founding-runbook, the run wins and the movement gets rewritten. The rite earns `status = live` only
# after a rehearsal completes end-to-end without an amendment.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/rehearse-founding.sh              # 2 cycles, burn after each
#   CYCLES=5 tools/rehearse-founding.sh     # run until it bores
#   KEEP=1 tools/rehearse-founding.sh       # leave the final mesh standing for inspection
#
# Prereq: the host builds first (`pnpm -r build`) — the containers trust the mounted dist.
