# surface-parity-witness — every MCP tool answers to a CLI door, and neither surface enumerates the other.
#
# ── THE INVARIANT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The MCP seat and the CLI reach the same vessel, so a tool an agent may call and an operator may not is a
# surface the operator cannot audit by hand. Every MCP tool therefore answers to a CLI door — as its own
# verb, or as a sub-verb of one.
#
# The converse does NOT hold, and that asymmetry is the ruling rather than a gap. The CLI carries the
# KEY-HOLDING ceremonies — founding, persona minting, the charter quorum, the vault beyond a status read,
# the raise. MCP speaks stdio-per-client, so N sessions run N processes; handing that surface a signing
# verb would put N unsynchronised holders on one operator's keys. The operator's hand keeps those.
#
# ── WHY THIS WITNESS EXISTS AT ALL ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Both descriptions of the MCP surface had drifted, each in the same direction: `mcp-resolve.ts` named
# nine verbs and `mcp-tool-registry.mem` named ten, while the live surface carried THIRTY. A hand-written
# list cannot notice what it missed, and both lists read as authoritative to anyone who found them. So the
# count is DERIVED here and nowhere transcribed.
#
# Exit 0 = every MCP tool has a CLI door.
