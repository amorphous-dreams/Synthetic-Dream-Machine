# founding-witness — found a vessel in a throwaway root and prove the boot path reads back what the
# founding wrote — in BOTH halves, because a founding stands two things.
#
# ── WHY A WITNESS AND NOT A UNIT TEST ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The founding writes a plane's name; the boot path reads it back. Both sides derive it, so a unit test on
# either side passes while they disagree — the pairing is the thing, and only a real founding exercises it.
# Everything between them runs here too: the keyhive ceremony, the ordering that mints a PersonaGroup before
# seeding its plane, the genesis seed, the on-disk bootstrap artifact.
#
# ── TWO HALVES, TWO WITNESSES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A founding stands a PLACE (`vessel found`) and later a FACE (`persona new 0`). One assertion cannot
# cover both: demanding a plane after the place alone fails a vessel that stands exactly as designed,
# and it fails identically whether the floor works or not — which makes it useless as a gate.
#
# So the PLACE half asserts a POSITIVE absence: @daemon named, and no persona pin anywhere. A place that
# quietly wrote a face would pass a looser check and break the facelessness the class rests on.
# The FACE half then lands and runs the pairing assertions, unchanged — the name the founding wrote
# against the name the boot path derives.
#
# It founds under LAR_ROOT in a temp dir, so it never touches the operator's own vessel state.
#
# Usage:  tools/founding-witness.sh          (exits non-zero on any disagreement)

# DIST-FRESHNESS PREFLIGHT. A WITNESS BUILDS NOTHING: `vessel found` rides `--skip-build`, so the CLI's
# fresh-build gate never rewrites the shared dist beneath a concurrent run. The witness therefore asks
# freshness itself, of the CLI it drives and of the mesh dist its two inline `node --input-type=module -e`
# blocks import BY PATH, and a stale build refuses here naming its cure.
