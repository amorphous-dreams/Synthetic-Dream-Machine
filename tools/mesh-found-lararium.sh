# mesh-found-lararium — found a self-contained, isolated Lararium into <dir> for the Docker mesh
# harness. Builds the genesis island (idempotent), gives <dir> its OWN genesis copy (init reads the
# engine CID from LAR_ROOT/genesis), then founds identity + social-bootstrap. The result is fully
# self-contained under <dir> — `genesis/` beside the XDG kinds an isolated root stands (`data/`, `state/`,
# `cache/`, `config/`, `run/`), with the two houses nested inside the data kind: `data/lares` for the
# spirits' identity, seal and vessel substrate, `data/lararium` for the house's shelf and sensoriums.
# Mountable into a container as LAR_ROOT. Secrets stay local (gitignore .mesh-test/).
