# ── WHY THIS EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The stamping sweep verified the corpus ad hoc, and the first repair after it re-derived the
# algorithm by hand instead of importing it — exactly the two-implementations drift the stamp-build
# header warns about: two computations that agree today and part silently the day one changes. This
# witness imports `verifyBcc` from the built package, so the reader that gates the corpus IS the
# reader the emitter answers to. One algorithm, one authority.
#
# Readings per carrier: ok · mismatch · unchecked. `unchecked` is LEGAL (the BCC is optional; a
# carrier declaring no uri-path names no meme to check) — only `mismatch` fails the witness.
# A run that checked nothing must not read as a run that found nothing: the summary always prints
# counts, and zero carriers scanned is itself a failure.
