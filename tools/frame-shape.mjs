// frame-shape — every carrier's frame marks stand on the CONTROL head, and the frame closes.
//
// `round-trip` catches a malformed frame, but it reports the damage as a LINE DIFF against a render —
// a reader meets seven lines of unified diff and has to infer that a mark rode the wrong opener. It is
// the right instrument for "this carrier does not survive a projection" and the wrong one for "this
// carrier's frame is malformed", which is a different fault with a different repair.
//
// THE SPLIT THE HEADS MAKE. `<<^` opens the control set; `<<~` opens the speaking set. A frame mark on
// the speaking head names a MALFORMED carrier, never an older one — the sets divide by capability, and
// merging them would re-fuse the domains the split exists to hold apart.
//
// Reported per carrier, per mark, so a repair reads off the finding instead of out of a diff.

  // a shape-specific guard invented to route around exactly that. One mask retires the guard.
