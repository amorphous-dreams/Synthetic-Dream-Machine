// frame-parity — the control marks the SPEC declares against the marks the CODE recognises.
//
// `api/pono/memetic-wikitext-framing` states the carrier frame: which control characters stand, what slots
// each carries, which stay reserved. The parser, the deserializer and the stream framer recognise
// their own set, written by hand, one regex at a time.
//
// NOTHING HERE COMPARED THE TWO. `rite-commands` checks an instructed command against a real door;
// `surface-parity` checks an MCP tool against a CLI door; `seed-parity` checks a seed against its
// twin. Every one of those pairs an instruction with an implementation — except the grammar, which
// is the one place a declaration can run ahead of the code that must hold it and nothing says so.
//
// A spec that names a mark no reader recognises is not a bug in either half. It is a bug in the SEAM,
// and a seam is exactly what no single-artifact witness can see.
//
// The reading runs one way on purpose: a mark the SPEC stands and no TIDDLER declares is a promise the
// tree cannot keep, and it fails. A tiddler declaring a mark the spec never wrote down only means the
// readers hold more than the spec says — reported, never refused.
