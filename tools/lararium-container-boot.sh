# A HEARTH THAT CARRIES IS NOT YET A HEARTH THAT TENDS. A single face lifts a vessel off the floor and

# so a face minted with neither seats nobody and `nexus seal show` reads an empty quorum with a
# fail-closed threshold. `LAR_STAND_KAHU` names the chairs, comma-separated, and this container seats
# them before it serves.
#
# THE SEAL IS FILE-LOCAL, so it lands before the exec below rather than against a running daemon —
# `seal reserve` and `seal seat` read and write this vessel's own nexus home. A container seats its
# own founding quorum for the same reason it founds its own identity: nothing in the mesh grants it.
# SEATING IS ONCE, NEVER EVERY BOOT. `seal seat` at genesis RE-DERIVES the genesis epoch, and every
# carriage entry roots on the epoch that stood when it was signed — so a re-seat on restart mints a new
# epoch and the fold denies every existing member. Measured: a contracted operator vanished from
# `members --list` across a plain container restart, with the admit entry still on the board, because
# the entry's epoch no longer matched the roster's.
