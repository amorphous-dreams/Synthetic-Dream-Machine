# browser-weld-witness — stand the app, drive a REAL browser, follow an edit toward the node's disk.
#
# ── WHY IT STANDS ALONE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# `lararium-browser`'s suite already runs in Chromium, but every vector there is package-scoped: it
# proves an organ. This proves a WELD, and a weld spans the browser's DOM and the node's filesystem —
# two sides no package-scoped suite can hold at once. It also boots a dev server, so it belongs
# outside `pnpm -r test` for the same reason the e2e harness does.
#
# ── ONE VECTOR, ONE FAILURE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The driver isolates each seam and names it. A combined "the edit reached disk" assertion would fail
# ambiguously — it reports that the weld broke and not where, which is the diagnosis this exists for.
# `gap` is not `FAILED`: a gap says a leg is unwired or the surface offered no target; a FAILED says a
# wired leg did not carry. Only FAILED sets the exit code.
#
# Usage:  tools/browser-weld-witness.sh
