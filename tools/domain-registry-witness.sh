# domain-registry-witness — every domain-separation tag is unique, well-formed, and lives in the registry.
#
# ── WHY A DOMAIN TAG NEEDS A WITNESS AND A DOC DOES NOT ─────────────────────────────────────────
# A typo in a domain tag does not fail loudly. It silently mints a SECOND protocol whose signatures verify
# against nothing and whose derived keys open nothing — and every test that signs AND verifies with the
# same typo passes. Nothing surfaces until two vessels that should agree do not.
#
# So the invariant rides here rather than in a reader's care:
#   · UNIQUE      — two purposes never share a tag. Fusing them is the whole failure the tags prevent.
#   · WELL-FORMED — every tag reads `lar:///ha.ka.ba/lares/domain/<name>/v<N>`, one ontology.
#   · REGISTERED  — no domain literal is written outside `domains.ts`. A tag typed at a call site is a
#                   tag nothing can audit, and it is how the two spellings arose in the first place.
#
# Prior art on the pattern itself: HKDF's `info` (RFC 5869), TLS 1.3's HkdfLabel (RFC 8446 §7.1), MLS's
# labelled signatures (RFC 9420), BIP-340 tagged hashes, EIP-712's domainSeparator. What they share is not
# the string — it is that the TABLE is the artifact, as multiformats makes plainest.
#
# Exit 0 = the registry holds.

# The list comes off ONE regex binding one exact spelling — `^export const NAME = d("name");`. A
# formatter reflowing a long line, a rename of the `d` helper, a trailing comment, or a declaration
# built from a table all empty it, and this witness would then print `0 domains` and exit 0 over a
# registry it had not read. A typo'd domain tag mints a second protocol whose signatures verify
# against nothing; that is precisely the failure this instrument exists to make loud, so its own
# silence is the worst affordable outcome here.
