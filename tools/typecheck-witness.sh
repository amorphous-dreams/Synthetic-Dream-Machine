# ── WHY THIS EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# `tsc` colorizes by default, so its output carries ANSI escapes BETWEEN the word "error" and the
# code: the literal bytes read `error\033[0m\033[90m TS2741`. A reader grepping for "error TS" —
# the obvious thing to grep for — matches NOTHING, and a package with two dozen real errors reports
# clean. The silence is indistinguishable from success, which makes it the worst kind of check: one
# that answers confidently and answers wrong.
#
# So this passes `--pretty false` and greps the plain form. It also drops TS6059 ("not under
# rootDir"), which every package emits by design: they resolve siblings through path mappings into
# source, and that arrangement is the monorepo's, not a fault in the code being checked.
#
# Run it rather than a hand-rolled grep. A check worth trusting is one whose failure mode you have
# seen fail.
