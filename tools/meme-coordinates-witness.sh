# meme-coordinates-witness — do a meme's DERIVED coordinates still name where it stands?
#
# TWO coordinates, TWO different facts, and each mirrors something the meme itself already carries:
#   `file-path` — where the carrier rests on disk.
#   `uri-path`  — the address in the carrier's own head sigil.
#
# Nothing stamps either. The deserializer derives a record's TITLE from the head sigil (a `title` written
# in the TOML is explicitly ignored) and the disk projector sites by that address, so `uri-path` consults
# nothing at ingest — its whole job is to AGREE, and a field whose only job is agreement is exactly the
# field that drifts unnoticed. 351 `file-path` values and 3 `uri-path` values had.
#
# The first pass here checked `file-path` alone, and the second coordinate was left to a reader's eye.
#
# `lares-history` sits exempt BY KIND: it archives prior worldlines, and its memes record the
# coordinates they were written with. Correcting those would edit the record rather than the map.
#
# Exit 0 = every coordinate names its own file. Exit 1 = the drift, listed.
