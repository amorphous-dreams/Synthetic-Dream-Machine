# rendezvous-parity-witness — the TS and PY sides resolve the SAME meeting place.
#
# TWO LANGUAGES DERIVE ONE ADDRESS. The daemon binds it from TypeScript; the MCP holder and every
# py-side verb dial it from `lares_uds`. Nothing but agreement joins them: no import crosses the
# seam, no type spans it, and the typechecker cannot see one half of it at all.
#
# Measured, that gap ran live. The socket moved out of `<dataDir>/lares.sock` and onto the rendezvous
# — `/tmp/lares-<uid>/<sha256(root)[0:12]>.sock`, which holds a fixed 40 bytes however deep the root
# runs — and the py side kept the retired spelling. The daemon served throughout. Every MCP verb met
# a socket nothing had created since the move, and 20 witnesses stayed green over it.
#
# So this collides the two derivations directly, under BOTH root branches: the XDG default and an
# isolated `LAR_ROOT`. A drift in either one is the whole surface going dark.

# DIST-FRESHNESS PREFLIGHT. Every inline import below reads `packages/lararium-mesh/dist` and
# `packages/lararium-node/dist` BY PATH, outside `distModule`'s own guard — so this witness checks
# the one digest itself before trusting either side's reading. The exit code is read directly, never
# through a pipe, so a refusal here reads 2 and names its cure rather than silently falling through
# into comparing two stale readings against each other.

# ── THE THIRD SPELLING ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# TS and python were gated against each other while the E2E HARNESS carried a third derivation
# nobody checked — it walked an instance root hunting a file named `lares.sock`, found nothing, and
# nine vectors across the join ceremony and the herm floor reported broken CEREMONIES for a rig that
# never reached them. A shared address needs one derivation used by EVERY side, harnesses included.
