## Loop Position

Orient follows Observe and works on what Observe hands forward.

Orient receives:

- raw findings
- named gaps
- conflicting signals
- stance pressure from the current reading frame

Orient changes:

- raw material into candidate pattern
- friction into named tension
- ambiguity into explicit open questions

Orient hands forward:

- a decision surface
- competing readings
- declared drift, mismatch, or surprise

Orient should not:

- gather a fresh corpus unless the loop genuinely needs more signal
- lock scope
- start building
- call the work complete

<<~ ahu #handoff >>

## Handoff

Orient feeds `◇ Decide`.

The handoff should let a later reader answer:

1. Which tensions matter here?
2. Which readings compete?
3. What still lacks operator steering?
4. What decision shape has emerged?

Fast-path loops can compress Observe and Orient together in familiar territory, but Orient still has to happen. Pattern-match speed does not cancel the phase.

<<~ ahu #conventions >>

## Conventions

| Rule | Weight | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Name tensions directly | MUST | Hidden tension becomes hidden scope |
| Keep open questions open until steering arrives | MUST | Premature closure corrupts the loop |
| Hold multiple stance readings when they matter | SHOULD | Syadasti pressure belongs here |
| Surface mismatch, not only fit | MUST | Drift often hides inside the mismatch |
| Let Talk Story carry some of the load | SHOULD | Telling often reveals pattern faster than reporting |
| Avoid verdict language | MUST | Verdicts belong to Decide or Assess |

**E-Prime discipline:** prefer `reads as`, `suggests`, `pulls toward`, `conflicts with`, `raises`, `matches`, `fails to match`. Those verb forms keep the phase inside interpretation without hard identity claims.

**Voice note:** Liminal can hold the space open; Mischief-Muse can surface odd links; Scryer can tighten the pattern; Council can stress-test the shape.

<<~ ahu #procedures >>

## Procedures

1. Start from the gathered surface, not from a conclusion.
2. Name the strongest pattern.
3. Name the strongest mismatch.
4. Float the open questions that block commitment.
5. Mark multi-stance readings when they materially differ.
6. Hand a bounded decision surface to `◇ Decide`.

**Failure mode:** Orient can sprawl into recursive musing. When the phase no longer sharpens the decision surface, the loop should either move or return to Observe for specific missing signal.

<<~/ahu >>
<<~ ahu #reading-test >>

## Reading Test

A future reader should recover all of this from the Orient span:

- the pattern under discussion
- the tension under discussion
- the open questions still alive
- the point at which the loop became decision-ready

If the prose sounds like a final verdict, Orient collapsed too early. If the prose only repeats findings, Observe never transformed into Orient.
