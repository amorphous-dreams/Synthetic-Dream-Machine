## Why Combined

The HUD's annotation thresholds (SIG-08) depend on the priority layer model (INV-02), and the register guard (INV-03) constrains HUD confidence reporting. Same sprint prevents cross-sprint stall.

**New in Rev 4 (Consecration):** Mana pool HUD element (`⚡ ~NN%` declared estimate of context window remaining — SIG-09). HUD rendering designed with tldraw target in mind. SAOD process as formal design methodology. Authority transfer model.

## Deliverables

### 1. INVARIANTS.md `[C:0.95]`

- `lares.core.*` behavioral invariant registry — 8 invariants from D-report TOML. Workers **validate against Kernel `[C:1.0]` tags; do not derive from scratch**.
- Priority layer model (INV-02): 7-layer table from D-report
- Register guard: Canon Promotion gate as formal invariant (INV-03)
- Reality Anchor (INV-07): subsumed into Input Signal Reading per EP-RA-001 v3 — consequence of register calibration on factual claims, not a separate check
- **REC-01 reconciliation:** C-report `canon` field (0.0–10.0 scale) vs D-report priority layer names — resolve mapping before SCH-01 promotes. Two representations, same concept.

### 2. TRUST_MODEL.md `[C:0.95]`

- Four-tier model: `user(anon)` → `user` → `operator` → `operator(admin)`
- UCAN capability model: additive authority, attenuation, time-bounded
- Trust gate as permission pipeline
- `contract_update` carries authorization tier

### 3. BIDIRECTIONAL_PROTOCOL.md `[CS:0.85]`

- EP-RA-001 v3: Input Signal Reading + output calibration as paired contract
- Mechanical grounding (all testable assertions):
  - Input register → output register ceiling
  - Input stance → response stance calibration (🏛️ → propositional; 🎭 → shorter, lower-commitment)
  - Verbosity scales inversely with input uncertainty
- Fiction Escalation Gate (US-003v3): one-line Provisional input ≠ ontological elaboration warrant
- Degraded-node detection: testable assertions per failure mode
- Frame-Uncertainty Protocol: three-move invariant chain (INV-08)
- **ATSA model (Gao 2023):** Cite as grounding framework — the Lares dual-tag system is a concrete ATSA (Agent Teaming SA) implementation. No existing deployed system found in literature that does real-time text interaction ATSA. Source: `../research/E-deep-research-report.md` §5.2.

### 4. INTENT_HEADER.md `[CS:0.85]`

- Format and forward-commitment semantics
- **SA display framing (not XAI):** Header is prospective — declares what the node will do. `--verbose` + STATE.jsonl audit trail are the retrospective XAI layer. Design methodology: Endsley's SAOD, not SHAP/LIME.
- **SAOD three-phase methodology (RES-01):** (1) SA Requirements Analysis via GDTA; (2) SA-Oriented Design Principles (present Level 2 directly; support Level 3 projection; organize by goals; support global SA); (3) SA Measurement and Validation. Reverse-map current HUD through GDTA to verify coverage before finalizing.
- Header Field Taxonomy: per-field thresholds keyed to p-band (SIG-08)
- Forward vs backward trace contract (SIG-07)
- **Channel fidelity note:** Register and stance (semantically interpretable) → higher declaration reliability. Phase and chronometer (procedural/structural) → higher confabulation risk. Source: Ji-An 2025 restricted metacognitive space finding (§3.3 of E-report).
- **SA type coverage:** The Lares HUD covers all three SA types simultaneously (Taskwork SA / Agent SA / Teamwork SA). Most existing AI transparency tools cover only Agent SA. State this explicitly as a design goal.

### 5. P_BAND_MODEL.md `[CS:0.85]`

- Five-band cumulative attention model
- p ↔ chronometer depth interaction (U4 resolution attempt)
- Micro-trace HUD annotation rules per band
- **Mana pool element (SIG-09, NEW Rev 4):** `⚡ ~NN%` declared estimate of context remaining. `~` prefix mandatory (marks approximation, not live readout). ~4 chars/token, 200k token window. Position: after `| p` in HUD compact form.
- **Cognitive load manager framing (primary function) `[CS:0.80]`:** p-band is first a cognitive load management control. Aviation HUD research (Lee 2024): excessive HUD symbology creates attentional tunneling. Text stream modality: HUD cost is sequential reading time (not visual complexity), but failure mode is structurally identical — operator reads header token-by-token, loses comprehension anchor for following prose. Lower p = simpler annotation = reduced capture risk.
- **Token budget framing (design assertion to test, not assume):** Higher p → denser annotation → more tokens on HUD metadata. Hypothesis: steering effect offsets metadata cost; net token usage lower with HUD than without. State with test criteria. See BKL-05. Mark `[SP:0.45]` until measured.

### 6. AGENTS.md + SPRINT_3_TASKS.md (hand-off)

Update this folder's AGENTS.md. Draft SPRINT_3_TASKS.md pre-brief.

## Pre-Loaded Context from Research (Workers Start Here)

### From E-deep-research-report.md `[S:0.70]` — 40+ source synthesis

**Start here for P_BAND_MODEL.md and INTENT_HEADER.md.**

Key sections to load:
- **§1.1** — Endsley three-level SA model
- **§1.2** — SA type mapping (all 7 HUD channels)
- **§1.3** — SAOD three-phase process (feeds INTENT_HEADER.md design methodology)
- **§2** — Prospective vs retrospective transparency (SA display / XAI distinction)
- **§3.3** — LLM metacognitive space (restricted; channel fidelity mapping)
- **§4.1 / §4.3** — Cognitive capture / attentional tunneling; text-stream modality differs from graphical HUD — model as reading-time budget, not visual-complexity score
- **§5.2** — ATSA bidirectional contract (feeds BIDIRECTIONAL_PROTOCOL.md; Agent Teaming SA as grounding framework)

**SA type coverage is novel:** Lares simultaneously covers Taskwork + Agent + Teamwork SA. State as design goal in INTENT_HEADER.md.

### From D-deep-research-report.md `[CS:0.82]`

8 invariants in TOML form + 7-layer priority table. **Start here for INV-01, INV-02.** Workers validate against Kernel; do not derive.

### From EP-RA-001 v3

Mechanical grounding for HUD annotation thresholds. **Start here for all HUD threshold work.** The bidirectional register/stance protocol is the mechanical foundation of SIG-04, SIG-08.

### From LIMINAL_PERSPECTIVES.md `[S:0.65]` (this folder, Sprint 0)

Three S2 open decisions that this research surfaces (SHD-01 through SHD-03 in `lares/signal/README.md`):
- p-band/token budget relationship as testable design assertion
- Progressive disclosure / HUD onboarding sequence (feeds SIG-05 and INTENT_HEADER.md)
- 7-channel cognitive load on new operators
